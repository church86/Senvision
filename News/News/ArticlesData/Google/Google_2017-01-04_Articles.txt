Since then, Huawei has issued a few software updates and yesterday revealed that the Mate 9 was making its US debut starting Friday, January 6. It will be available for only $599.99. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage The Mate 9 brings together the big screen and battery of the Mate 8 and the awesome dual-lens Leica camera from the P9 to create the absolute best of Huawei in a single device. These hardware features are then powered by the latest Android 7.0 Nougat and EMUI 5.0 so that this single device has everything an enterprise user could want in a single Android smartphone. The Huawei Mate 9 will be sold as a GSM SIM-unlocked phone in the US at Newegg, Amazon, B&H, and Best Buy. CNET Review: Miss your Note 7? This is the big-screened phone to buy A billboard at CES also showed that an Amazon Alexa-powered version of the Mate 9 will be launching in 2017. We don't yet have any details on the Alexa integration, but it could be an interesting move for both Huawei (to reach more US customers) and Amazon (to sell more through an established smartphone brand). Specifications Processor: Huawei Kirin 960 2.4 GHz octa-core Display: 5.9 inch 1920x1080 pixels resolution LCD (373 ppi) Operating system: Android 7.0 Nougat with EMUI 5.0 RAM: 4GB Storage: 64GB internal with microSD expansion card slot.

The Huawei Mate 9 will be available in space gray and moonlight silver. Hardware Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Huawei builds gorgeous hardware with dual beveled edges, brushed aluminum shells, 2.5D front glass, minimal bezels, super fast rear fingerprint scanners, and clear displays. The Mate 9 continues the tradition of design excellence and the fit and finish is stunning. While the 1080p display is not the highest resolution available today, it works well for me in interacting with the device, watching videos, and capturing images. 5.9 inches is a great size for getting work done and spreadsheets look great on the Mate 9 when combined with a Bluetooth keyboard for working on the go. The Kirin 960 chipset and EMUI 5.0 help the Mate 9 fly and I have yet to see a single slowdown or performance lag. Even with early software over the past couple of months, the device has been stellar and reliable. It has been a pleasure using devices that I can charge up in the morning and use to my heart's content all day long for 12 or more hours without even glancing for a power cord. I experience this with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL, and also with the Huawei Mate 9. I take my phone off the charger at 4:45 am and can go until 10:00 pm with these three devices. When you connect a USB Type-C cable to the Mate 9, you can also choose the reverse charge option to use the massive battery in the Mate 9 to charge up other devices. This is a handy feature to charge up headphones or other accessories. Huawei Mate 9 first impressions: in pict... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 20 NEXT PREV One thing that doesn't often get mentioned is RF signal strength and with the Huawei Mate 9 I am seeing connectivity in areas where my iPhone 7 Plus struggles to even make a call. The Mate 9 has been the best performer I have seen since the Galaxy Note 7, thanks to the inclusion of five 2G bands, 10 3G bands and 20 4G bands. Even though it was likely not a battery failure that caused the problems with the Note 7, Huawei has 5-gate protection on the Mate 9 so you can rest assured you will experience a safe charging experience with the device. To experience the fastest charging on the Mate 9, you need to use the proprietary SuperCharge adapter. Huawei states you can get a full day's usage out of just a 20 minute charge. The Huawei Mate 9 upgrades the Leica dual-lens experience with integration of optical image stabilization (OIS) in both cameras. The color and monochrome cameras work together to help you capture professional photos with ease. The 4-1 hybrid auto-focus features laser focus, phase detection focus, depth focus, and contrast focus. In November I captured some photos with the Huawei Mate 9, BlackBerry DTEK60, and Apple iPhone 7 Plus. You can view the originals in this Flickr album. I then wrote a dual camera comparison article and posted more photos from the Huawei Mate 9, LG V20, Honor 8, and iPhone 7 Plus with the originals contained in this Flickr album. You can judge for yourself, but I find the Mate 9 photos to be the best of all of these phones. I took the Mate 9 along to New York City for a daddy-daughter Christmas weekend and captured some fantastic shots with the Mate 9. I particularly enjoyed the monochrome photos on the Brooklyn Bridge and wide aperture images. A couple samples are included below: Wide aperture in Times Square Monochrome shot on the Brooklyn Bridge Software Since so many readers have been concerned about Emotion UI (EMUI) 4.0, I wrote about the improvements in EMUI 5.0 in my first impressions article. You will see improvements in EMUI 5.0, including an app drawer option, enhanced notifications and quick settings, split screen mode, and Huawei's integrated intelligence designed to analyze your behavior and adapt the device for an optimal experience. While the default Huawei home screen, with app drawer, is a solid offering, as soon as I tested it out for a few days I loaded up the Google Now Launcher. I prefer to have the Google Now cards available to me with a simple swipe to the right and have enjoyed running this for the past month. Beyond the EMUI 5.0 improvements, I am a huge fan of the Huawei gallery application and image editing tools that help you develop some creative images to share with family and friends. HTC used to have its own custom gallery and editing tools, but switched to Google Photos. Google Photos is fine for backup and photo management, but a custom gallery with high-powered editing tools provides for a much better experience. The color splash option is my personal favorite on the Huawei Mate 9. Other apps included by Huawei are: a file explorer, flashlight, Huawei Health, Huawei HiCare (service app), Huawei HiGame (game store), Music (media player), Notepad, Smart Controller (IR control app), Themes, Todoist, Weather, and WPS Office. While I haven't yet been able to test the new Amazon Alexa integration, Huawei stated the following in its press release: Huawei also announced it will bring Alexa, Amazon's cloud-based voice service, to the Huawei Mate 9. Customers can ask Alexa to set an alarm, or build to-do lists; get the weather, traffic reports, and more. In addition, Alexa can also control a broad array of smarthome devices. Available in early 2017, access to Amazon Alexa will be pre-installed in an app on Mate 9, providing customers with a natural, convenient user interface to perform tasks and get information. For existing Mate 9 owners at that time, it will be available by over-the-air update. Huawei and Amazon will collaborate to develop rich voice activated consumer experiences for mobile users. Pricing and competition With the Galaxy Note 7 out of contention, the next closest Android competitors to the Huawei Mate 9 are the LG V20, Google Pixel XL, and Moto Z Force Droid. These are all excellent Android smartphones, but the Mate 9 challenges them with battery life, camera performance, and speed. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is also a worthy competitor to the Huawei Mate 9, but I prefer the larger display and smaller bezels of the Mate 9. Riding the Staten Island ferry I thought we would see the Mate 9 come in at a price close to $800, given what we have seen with UK pricing. The $600 launch price stuns me as that makes it $120 less than the Moto Z Force Droid, $170 less than the LG V20, and a whopping $269 less than the comparable 128GB Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. These both only have integrated storage too while you can further expand the storage capacity of the Huawei Mate 9 for a reasonable price. Daily usage experiences and conclusions A couple years ago Huawei released the Ascend Mate 2 in the US and its long battery life and low price made it a compelling choice. Huawei is finally releasing another big flagship in the US with the Huawei Mate 9 and it is one of the best Android phones available today. The Huawei Mate 9 is a large phone, but for those of use who spend hours each day on our phones, a large display is an asset. Huawei provides a massive 5.9 inch display in a form factor nearly equal to the 5.5 inch iPhone 7 Plus. While the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel provide great camera experiences, the software on both of those devices is basic and appeals to the masses. I haven't had so much fun with a camera as I did with the Huawei P9 and the Mate 9 makes that even better. The Mate 9 camera is my current favorite and I am thoroughly enjoying all of the advanced capture modes. The Galaxy Note 7 was my favorite Android device prior to the Google Pixel XL, but after spending time with the Huawei Mate 9 it is clear to me it is an exceptional phone for the business user. Priced at just $599.99, it is the best priced flagship available today.

Video provided by AFP Newslook Crowds gather to see a BMW concept vehicle at the BMW Group news conference Wednesday at CES in Las Vegas. (Photo: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation) LAS VEGAS — Not that long ago, checking in on the state of self-driving car technology meant asking Google's engineers how they were doing. The search company was virtually alone on the autonomous car highway. But in the last four years, that road has gotten crowded. The Consumer Electronics Show has served as a leading indicator of the growing interest in self-driving tech, eventually welcoming to what traditionally was a gadget-fest more than a dozen automakers. Two years ago, Ford CEO Mark Fields even delivered the keynote, a spotlight previously reserved for the likes of Bill Gates. This year, CES, which wraps here Sunday, again puts a spotlight on the mounting competition between not just the automakers but also the suppliers vying to provide the high-tech components that allow vehicles to navigate through a world of obstacles. It's clear now that engineers are able to make cars drive themselves. The bigger issue is how to scale this technology in a way that finds it both culturally embraced and scientifically sound — and is cost effective. As tech companies such as Nvidia, Intel, Harman join major auto brands such Audi, BMW and Volvo — 500 auto-tech companies large and small came to CES this year — in showing off their chips, sensors and smart cars, one has to wonder if this is a winner-take-all contest or if we're creating competing standards that could delay the arrival of a self-driving future. "There's a lot of desire to be the ones who can get there first and monetize this market for self-driving cars and it's causing almost a frenetic activity across the automotive industry, both from automakers and from tech companies," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. If the various self-driving car booths here had a singular mission, it was to showcase how much safer the driving world can be thanks to technology. Delphi's Mary Gustanski explains the display inside a self-driving Audi SUV in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive gave reporters rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. Its self-driving system was developed with sensors made by Mobileye and chips from Intel that automatically avoided a collision without input from its driver. "I see the potential for zero accidents and mobility for all simply because drivers have been taken out of the transportation equation," said Doug Davis, who leads Intel's automated driving group. Many automakers have set an eventual goal of zero deaths in their vehicles, remarkable considering that 30,000 die each year in the U.S. and more than a million worldwide. The competition to produce technology that can help car companies reach that milestone is intensifying quickly. AT&T, Intel, Nvidia: latest names in self-driving AT&T announced at CES that it was working with Delphi and Ford on improving vehicle communication with other cars and infrastructure. AT&T is also building a self-driving test center in Michigan with the American Center for Mobility. Intel and Mobileye are working with BMW to deploy 40 self-driving BMWs by the second half of 2017, the companies said here Wednesday. Intel, which announced that it plans to invest in high-definition mapping-firm Here, also is developing autonomous driving hardware and software platforms that could serve as a standard for other innovators to adopt. Meanwhile, Intel competitor Nvidia announced at CES Wednesday that it had landed Germany's ZF Group as its first customer for a car-computing platform powered by its chips that boasts both machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. Big names in the chip game such as Qualcomm and AMD are also in the hunt. "We are going to see cars become the next major platform to battle over for the semiconductor makers," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. USA TODAY Nvidia aims to spread Google AI through home USA TODAY Faraday Future's electric car gets a face and a name: FF 91 Samsung, too, became a major player in car connectivity and autonomous driving with its November $8 billion acquisition of Harman, which has its own auto tech expertise and relationships with automakers. "It is by far the hottest area in terms of tech," O'Donnell said. In Harman's demonstration area at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the company showed off all the various aspects of autonomous vehicles, including smart ride-sharing cars that adapt the car's settings, display and personal audio zones based on riders' profiles. Harman's holographic augmented reality display proof of concept for autonomous vehicles on display at the CES in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Harman) Another self-driving car Harman showcased offers riders a fully-immersive IMAX-style projection and sound system. Also on display was cybersecurity software to protect your car from hackers. Harman's partners in its autonomous car-tech quest include Apple, Daimler Chrysler, Google, IBM and Microsoft. All this collaboration would seem to bode well, but the truth is even those deeply enmeshed in the self-driving car world believe there are many miles to be driven before the masses enjoy this breakthrough. "No one company can do everything," said Dinesh Paliwal, Harman CEO and Chairman. Even though, "the autonomous car is almost here, we are 10 to 15 years out from the day when you have the majority of the cars with smarts that interact with each other through the cloud." In the meantime, expect auto-tech breakthroughs to trickle down into new vehicles in the form of increasingly sophisticated driver-assist features, just as driver-assisted parking and automatic braking have so far. USA TODAY Toyota car gives driver an artificial intelligence buddy And along the way, some companies may fall to the wayside, as did some in the transition from traditional cell phones to today's smartphones. "The next 10 years is going to be as influential in the car and personal transportation world as the smartphone has been in the past ten years," Autotrader's Brauer said. "You are going to see companies disappear because they can't adapt quickly enough." O'Donnell agrees and expects the industry to coalesce around multiple approaches. "It's an exciting area and it’s clear no one owns it. Frankly, it's big enough there may be multiple players."

(CHS) Fiat Chrysler Partners With Google On Infotainment System January 2nd, 2017 - By Teri Schroder - 0 comments Filed Under: Headlines - Technology Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) has partnered with Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to build a new in-car infotainment system. The companies announced the partnership just ahead of the beginning of CES, the annual consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. The new system is a combination of FCA’s UConnect infotainment system and Android 7.0 Nougat, released in 2016. It will be on display in a Chrysler 300 sedan at CES this week. The new infotainment system operates a range of features, including HVAC, navigation, AM/FM, media streaming, Bluetooth calling and media streaming, multi-channel audio, and digital instrument clusters. The system also supports a number of apps like Google Assistant and Maps, as well as other Android apps like Pandora and Spotify. Google wants Android integrated into every user-facing system in the car, from climate control and audio controls to the speedometer. In a press release announcing the news, Patrick Brady, Director of Android Engineering, said, “Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way.” The new system is open-source, allowing automakers to customize it to their tastes. Customizability is very important, as carmakers create their infotainment user interface to be an extension of the car brand itself. With a pre-existing Android app ecosystem, carmakers may be able to save time and money developing infotainment systems on top of Android. Chris Barman, FCA’s head of electrical engineering, said in a statement, “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” Neither FCA nor Google has announced when the platform will be available in dealer showrooms. Google’ work with FCA is different than the Android Auto model. Android Auto is an in-car software platform that brings the functionality and feel of a smartphone to the vehicle’s central screen. It’s not an operating system; it’s a layer that sits on top of the operating system. At its 2016 I/O developer conference, Google released a version of Android Auto that would run directly on a phone. Apple is also seeking to integrate its mobile products in car systems via CarPlay. However, Apple maintains way more control over the look and feel of the interface.

It's a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow.  At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. John Herrington, senior vice president of Samsung Electronics America, unveils new refrigerators with Family Hub 2.0 during a Samsung news conference before CES International, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas. Family Hub 2.0 features an interface on the refrigerator with apps that can be controlled by voice recognition.

So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening.  Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as 'Alexa,' it shares what it hears with Amazon's servers to process a response.  Those conversations are then stored indefinitely.  Google's Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo 'has to listen to everything. That's kind of disturbing,' said Ryan O'Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security's threat research center.  'It doesn't capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could.  'You're trusting the devices to not do that, but it's entirely possible.'

Share this article Share 94 shares In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend's home requested the contents of the home's Echo and Amazon's stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence.  The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked.  Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to 'overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.' Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people's privacy. DID ALEXA WITNESS A MURDER?  Amazon said it objects to 'overbroad' requests as a matter of practice Authorities investigating the death of an Arkansas man whose body was found in a hot tub want to expand the probe to include a new kind of evidence: any comments overheard by the suspect's Amazon Echo smart speaker. Amazon said it objects to 'overbroad' requests as a matter of practice, but prosecutors insist their idea is rooted in a legal precedent that's 'as old as Methuselah.' The issue emerged in the slaying of Victor Collins, who was found floating face-up last year in the hot tub at a friend's home in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.  The friend, James Andrew Bates, was later charged with murder. Prosecutors have asked the court to force Amazon to provide data from the Echo that could reveal more clues about the night of Nov. 22, 2015, when Collins was apparently strangled and drowned.    'It's not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,' O'Leary said.  'People say you shouldn't be concerned if you're not doing anything wrong, but that's a dangerous precedent to set.' Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator.  Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo.

For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It's there for those who want to use it, but it's not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon's Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia's Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google's Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung's new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. 'Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children's toys,' said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. 'Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.' Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to 'live forever' online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. WHAT IS AMAZON ECHO?  Amazon Echo is a voice-controlled smart speaker that works alongside a smartphone app. Using a virtual assistant called Alexa, the speaker can respond to voice commands from the user, such as setting an alarm or ordering a cab. Echo also works with services like Spotify as a 360-degree wireless speaker.  The Amazon Echo and smaller Echo Dot speakers were launched in the UK in September in black and white   Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast's Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. 'This is less invasive than that,' he said. 'It's just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.'  A refrigerator with Family Hub 2.0 is on display during a Samsung news conference before CES International, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas.

LG Puts Up January Security Bulletin Before Google Google in its latest Android security bulletin has two security patch level strings. The company says that this will provide Android partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices. The partial security patch level string (2017-01-01) indicates that all issues associated with previous security patch level strings are addressed while the complete security patch level string (2017-01-05) indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01 and 2017-01-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed. Google says that all supported devices will receive a single OTA update with the Wednesday security patch level. In the January security patch, Google fixes total of 95 vulnerabilities in which 23 bugs are fixed with 2017-01-01 patch while 72 are fixed under 2017-01-05 patch. The security bulletin assures that OEM partners were notified about the issues on December 5, and source code patches for these issues will be released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository in the next 48 hours. Between the two patches Google has fixed over two-dozen high severity issues and 10 critical problems. Google adds, "We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly reported issues."

Leisure Home LBoard COMMENT Safeguard Malaysia’s image at all cost Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Baidu family robot a Chinese spin on Amazon Echo AFP | January 6, 2017 Using voice to interact with computers able to essentially learn from experiences was among hot trends at CES. SHANGHAI: Chinese internet colossus Baidu is out to make a splash with ‘Little Fish,’ a freshly unveiled family robot that is a voice-controlled virtual valet akin to Amazon Echo or Google Home. Baidu showed off “Little Fish,” a translation of its Chinese name “Xiaoyu Zaijia,” on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas ahead of its release in China later this year. “I think 2017 will be the year of conversational computing,” Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng said while demonstrating “Little Fish” for AFP behind closed doors at the show. “We see a clear path of conversational computers changing everything.” Using voice to interact with computers able to essentially learn from experiences was among hot trends at CES. Arrays of device makers boasted of adding digital aide capabilities with the help of Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant technology. Unlike Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices that let people ask for information or control devices by speaking, this Chinese one featured a touch-screen on top of its orb-shaped base. A camera on top tracked faces, and the screen swiveled to keep facing a speaker. “Speech is the fastest way for you to communicate with a computer, but a screen is a very fast way for a machine to communicate back to you,” Ng said. For example, he added, it would be quicker to glance at a requested listing from Yelp of top restaurants than it would be to listen for the computer to read all the names and descriptions. Baidu already has DuerOS in other devices in China, such as set-top TV boxes that can switch channels by voice command or figure out names of actors on screen when asked. A bigger vision at Baidu is to build DuerOS into a “conversational computing” platform built into a broad range of devices and tapping into the internet company for search, food delivery, online commerce and more. “If this takes off, I am not worried about how we will make money,” Ng said when asked about revenue plans. “This is a huge new category. It will transform how you use devices in your home. There are plenty of business models.” “Little Fish,” a second-generation device, will be released in China in March at a price yet to be disclosed, according to Baidu. Baidu partnered with hardware firm Ainemo to build it. “We believe family robots will be the next big category that will be a member of everybody’s home,” Ainemo chief executive and founder Chenfeng Song said in a release.

Mobile by Rick Broida January 5, 2017 3:02 PM PST @cheapskateblog Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Paris, je t'aime. During the week between Christmas and New Years, I was lucky enough to visit the City of Light. It was breathtaking from start to finish, and if you heard reports of a man being dragged kicking and screaming onto a flight leaving Paris, well... The last time I'd been abroad, there were no smartphones. Meaning no Google Maps, no Uber, no Yelp, etc. How I managed to get anywhere, I can't imagine. Thankfully, modern technology makes modern global travel infinitely easier, especially if you plan ahead. Here's what I learned on my holiday vacation. SIM in advance Traveling abroad? Slap a KnowRoaming sticker on your SIM card and it'll automatically connect to a local network once you arrive.Photo by KnowRoaming Conventional wisdom says that once you reach a foreign country, you should just buy a SIM card and switch over to it while you're there. Conventional wisdom is wrong. For starters, you need service the moment you land, whether it's to call the hotel, summon an Uber or just text family that you've arrived safely. You may be able to find a SIM vendor at the airport, but do you really want to rely on that? And what if there's a language barrier and you need tech help? My advice: Get your SIM card in advance. You may pay slightly higher rates overall, but you'll also be good to roam as soon as the plane touches down. I recommend KnowRoaming, which comes in two flavors: a straight-up replacement for your existing SIM card and a sticker that permanently affixes to your existing card -- effectively putting two SIMs in your phone at once. I had the opportunity to test both in France, and for the most part they worked very well. The big challenge -- as with virtually any SIM swap -- is that you inherit a new phone number, which can cause text-messaging complications. More on that below. KnowRoaming's call and message rates are very cheap, and you can buy an unlimited-data package for $7.99 per day. Local pay-as-you-go rates may well be cheaper, but I think $8 is extremely reasonable given the convenience. Beat two-factor authentication Because of the whole new-number thing, I discovered mid-vacation that I couldn't reset a Gmail password -- which I needed to do because one of my Gmail accounts tends to go bananas (read: insist it's suspicious activity) whenever I connect to an unfamiliar IP address. (Anyone who can help me solve this longstanding problem, which I've researched heavily, gets a box of doughnuts.) See, that account uses two-factor authentication, meaning that in order to verify my identify, I have to verify receipt of a text message. But I couldn't do that because my primary number wasn't accessible while I was using the foreign SIM. Hmmm. The solution: plan ahead. Before leaving, make sure all critical accounts -- bank, email, work, Facebook, Twitter, etc. -- are set to verify your identity using a different (i.e. non-text-message) method. This might be a secondary email account, an app like Google Authenticator, or even a local friend's phone number. Learn the mysteries of iMessage If you're an iPhone user, iMessage is pretty great -- until you find yourself with a different phone number. Then things get...complicated. Consider: iMessage relies on data, not SMS, so you'd think that as long as you're connected to the internet (Wi-Fi or data plan), you're golden. But iMessage is still tied to your phone number, and if you change that number (like when you swap SIM cards), things go tilt. At least, that's what happened with the four members of my family. I won't bore you with the details, other than to suggest that iPhone users wanting to communicate with other iPhone users should plan ahead. For starters, consider tweaking iMessage so that it uses your email address for sending and receiving texts. (You can do this in the Settings app by tapping Messages > Send & Receive, then selecting your email address in both the "can be reached" and "start new conversations from" sections.) That's still a very messy solution, because existing messaging threads may no longer work, and you'll have to switch everything back when you're back to your home SIM. Thus, I have the same recommendation for iPhone users that I do for everyone... Use a third-party messaging app SMS overseas is a hassle any way you slice it, in part because of the cost, and in part because of your new phone number. A much better bet: some other messaging app. Take Facebook Messenger. It needs only data, and it's not tied to your phone number. Using it overseas is exactly the same experience as using it at home. Plus, you can use it to make voice or video calls -- again with just data. The catch, of course, is that you can only call or message other Facebook Messenger users. The same is true of many of other messaging apps (including the venerable Whatsapp), which is why I consider Textnow a great choice for the overseas traveler. It assigns you a phone number that stays the same regardless of your SIM selection, and it can send messages to non-Textnow users. (Inbound messages can also be delivered via email, a helpful backup copy of sorts.) However, Textnow can handle only some short-code messages, meaning you may get flight alerts from your airline and you may not. Indeed, any new number you use while traveling could put a crimp in text-based notifications, another reason to plan ahead and make sure you can get notifications a different way (like via email). Google Translate FTW Despite a 25-year gap between my trip and my four years of high-school French, I managed to communicate pretty well. That said, I'm far from fluent, and there were lots of signs and menus I couldn't read and questions I couldn't properly ask. But luckily I had the godsend that is Google Translate (Android|iOS). This free app made it a cinch to convert English words and phrases -- either spoken or typed -- into French, while the camera mode magically translated printed French text (the aforementioned signs and menus) into English. For a variety of reasons, the success rate of the latter was on the lower side, with occasionally hilarious results. (One translated placard of a famous painting revealed the subject to be the "King of Poo.") Google Translate can perform on-the-fly translations when you're online, but it can also work offline if you download translation databases. To save time (and data) while traveling, download languages in advance. Tap the Settings icon, then Offline translation. Tap the plus sign in the upper-left corner, then choose the language you want to download. Bring extra power plugs So you bought a universal power adapter -- good start. That'll let you plug in exactly one device -- which may end up being your spouse's curling iron. One measly travel adapter isn't enough, especially if it gives you just one electrical outlet. Instead, just as you would for travel at home, pack a country-compatible wall plug that offers from two to four USB ports -- the kind you need for charging your phone, tablet, Bluetooth earbuds and Bluetooth speaker. Speaking of which... Bring a speaker Enlarge Image A compact speaker like this one is easy to bring on global journeys.Photo by Tecart OK, this holds true for travel anywhere, not just to other countries. But I can't tell you much we enjoyed listening to Spotify's French Holiday playlist over breakfast in the morning; it just added to the flavor of the experience. A good travel speaker should be compact and lightweight, of course, but with enough oomph to make it worth schlepping. For example, the Tecart Aqua BS100 (currently $19.99 at Amazon) won't add a lot of bulk to your carry-on, but runs for up to 10 hours on a charge and even offers an IPX6 waterproof design. It's just one option of many. My home Wi-Fi is terrible This is just an anecdote, a home-network troubleshooting tip I learned while traveling. Before we left home, we downloaded various movies and TV shows from iTunes and Netflix. They took forever. I'm not sure why, but media downloads have always been super-slow on my phones and tablets. But in the Airbnb apartment we stayed in, episodes of Netflix's "The Crown" downloaded in seconds. It was amazing! I don't know if I have a router issue or what, but it made me realize something is amiss on the old home network, and worth investigating. Obviously I could have made that same discovery anywhere. But hotel Wi-Fi (indeed, most public Wi-Fi) is almost always terrible, so being in another home produced different results. You don't have to go all the way to Paris, but if you're having a download or connectivity issue in your home, try a friend or neighbor's house and see if the problem disappears. It may help you narrow down the cause. And that's it! Do you have any international-travel tips of your own to share?

"Speech is the fastest way for you to communicate with a computer, but a screen is a very fast way for a machine to communicate back to you," Ng said. For example, it would be quicker to glance at a requested list of top restaurants from Yelp than it would be to listen to the computer read all the names and descriptions, he said. - Transformative - Little Fish uses Baidu's operating system DuerOS, which is already employed by other devices in China, such as set-top TV boxes that can switch channels by voice command or figure out names of actors on screen when asked. The bigger vision is to build DuerOS into a broad range of gadgets that tap into Baidu's internet capabilities for search, food delivery, online commerce and more. "If this takes off, I am not worried about how we will make money," Ng said when asked about revenue plans. "It will transform how you use devices in your home. There are plenty of business models." Little Fish, a second-generation device, will be released in China at a price yet to be disclosed, according to Baidu. Baidu partnered with hardware firm Ainemo to build it. "We believe family robots will be the next big category that will be a member of everybody's home," Ainemo chief executive and founder Chenfeng Song said in a release. - AI taking hold - Artificial intelligence, or AI, is getting a foothold in homes, with developers feverishly adding "skills" to Amazon Echo speakers infused with Alexa. Google, meanwhile, is using its AI prowess in Android smartphones, messaging software, and a vase-sized Home digital assistant. The home hubs, sometimes referred to as smart speakers, fetch content or answers from the internet, and can act as remote controls for other devices in houses. "We are moving technologies beyond the smartphone," said Shawn DuBravac, chief economist at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) that organizes CES. "Ultimately, vocal computing is replacing the (screen)." Chinese tech giant Huawei said at CES that it is adding Amazon's Alexa to its flagship smartphone for its US launch. China-based Lenovo announced it was launching a smart home assistant powered by Alexa, joining the growing roster of contenders in the market for voice-activated devices. "In the smart home, voice is clearly important," DuBravac said. "We are seeing that play out at CES." He expected voice technology to quickly improve, within years perhaps even being able to recognize speakers so accurately it could be used for biometric security, or simple parental override of internet use by offspring. "I know that in my home with my boys, I would like Alexa to recognize my voice as the ruler of the coop," DuBravac quipped. While digital assistant technology is being built into televisions, appliances and more, hub devices such as Alexa will be key to voice-controlled computing, according to the economist. NPD analyst Ben Arnold said at CES that he is "bullish on everything voice and AI," with the technologies eventually "pollenating" devices so thoroughly they essentially become home operating systems.

The update brings Apple Health integration into the iOS app, so that users will keep track and be more motivated to reach their fitness goals.  On Thursday, Google released an update for its Google Calendar app that turns the to-do app into a sports-oriented tool. With Apple Health integration, users will not have to worry about achieving their Goals anymore. According to 9to5Mac, there is also an additional feature that will automatically mark fitness tasks as finished whenever the user is done with them. Another tweak adjusts the intelligent Goals feature, so users can make the most out of their allotted time for exercise. It can be noted that users had to manually mark the Goals they already accomplished to avoid receiving reminders about them. Now that the Goals are automatically marked as “done,” users do not need to do anything or worry about getting Goal reminders every so often.  Related Stories Triby IO Is A Hub That Combines Google Home With Alexa FoldiMate Introduces Laundry-Folding Robot Xiaomi Showcases Mi TV 4 At CES 2017 With the update, users can now sync their Google Calendar app on their phones with Google Fit and Apple Health, so their fitness efforts would be documented religiously. The performance tracker has also been upgraded to show a visual representation of how close users are to completing their fitness goals, as per Android Authority.  Last year, Google introduced the Goals feature to its Google Calendar app. The feature is designed to help users find sufficient time to work out amid their busy schedules. It runs on machine learning, so it relies on algorithms to identify the times that it would be fitting for users to squeeze in simple activities to achieve their Goals, as reported by CNET.  The Google Calendar app is available for download from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Not really, anyway. Sure, there were a few decent ChromeOS apps, but it made no sense that they couldn't run the zillions of apps that Google's own Android mobile OS enjoyed. That problem is finally sorted. Samsung's new Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro — one powered by ARM, one powered by an Intel Core m3 — can run any Android app that lives on the Google Play store. That means all of Google's own in-house apps like Docs, as well as any game or app that a smartphone or tablet can run. The result of an ongoing collaboration between Samsung and Google, both use 12.3-inch 2400x1600pixel displays and have 4GB of RAM, as well as the traditionally light-for-a-laptop 32GB of storage — Chromebooks mostly suit the user that stores everything in Google Drive or Gmail. Taking an obvious cue from Samsung's Note smartphone line, the Chromebooks have a stylus integrated into the body that can be used to mark up the touchscreen display, which itself hinges 360 degrees to be used as a tablet-esque device. Battery life is claimed to be eight hours — certainly possible given the relatively low level of processing power from those ARM or Core m3 CPUs. No word on whether the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will make it to Australia, though — we're tracking that information down for you ASAP. US pricing is in the region of $US449 for the Plus. [Samsung] This story originally appeared as part of Gizmodo's CES 2017 coverage. Comments Joane Reymond @joanereymond Jan 7, 2017, 5:27pm Once the Android app support is more widespread I'll probably get a Chromebook to replace my android tablet. Reply 0 WhitePointer @whitepointer Jan 7, 2017, 7:28pm It's not just these two Chromebooks, there's going to be a large number of Chromebooks all supporting Android apps in the very near future. Reply 0 johnnathan @johnnathan Jan 8, 2017, 10:45pm This is something amazing that Samsung’s latest chromebooks are supporting android apps. It means that tablet will drop its popularity.

Name: Subject: Message: Huawei Mate 9 Pro, Porsche Design Mate 9 and ZTE Axon 7 to add Daydream VR support Newsby John Callaham1 week ago 1 700 5 More Android phones will soon be adding support for Google’s Daydream VR platform, which launched in November with the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Today, the company confirmed that the Mate 9 Pro and Porsche Design Mate 9 phones from Huawei, along with the ZTE Axon 7, will all be updated with support for Daydream apps in the near future. See also: Launch day: Daydream VR apps roundup November 10, 2016 These three phones join the already announced ASUS ZenFone AR, which will have both Daydream and Tango augmented reality support when it launches later in 2017. In addition, Huawei is also working on its own smartphone VR headset that will be compatible with any Daydream app. Google stated the headset will have a 95 degree field of view, along with an adjustable focus so it can be used without eyeglasses. This will be the first third-party headset to support Daydream; Google has been selling its own DayDream View headsets since November for $79. Huawei’s headset will only be sold in China. There’s no word on when the new Huawei VR headset will go on sale, nor is there any info on what its price tag will be. Nevertheless, we strongly suspect that it should land somewhere around the price of Google’s headset. All of this would seem to bode well for the Daydream platform as a whole, and we expect more Android smartphone makers will join this group in 2017.

Additionally, Huawei is working on its own Daydream headset (pictured above) which will be available later this year exclusively for Huawei devices. For the ASUS ZenFone AR, which we have written up a couple of times now, it also supports Tango, which is Google’s augmented reality hardware/software platform. It should be noted, the Mate 9 Pro isn’t exactly for the US market. It’s never been officially made available, but you can find it on Amazon for about $1,000+. Main difference between the standard Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro is a curved 5.5″ QHD AMOLED display instead of a 5.9″ FHD LCD display. Daydream fans, go celebrate. Via: Google Post navigation Previous StorySanDisk’s New 256GB A1 MicroSD Card Wants All of Your Apps Next StoryDid Verizon Just Out a 256GB Pixel and Pixel XL? GammaSmasher71 I’m just waiting for T mobile to carry something compatible. It’s driving me nuts to wait, but the longer it takes, the more content I’ll have available when I finally do get it. billy I still haven’t opened the Daydream viewer I got last month for pre ordering the Pixel. Maybe Cardboard ruined VR for me, but I’m having a hard time getting excited… sinfoman I read this site EVERY. DAY. How did I miss “Porsche Design Mate 9??” Because nothing says “Cult-level sports car” like… Huawei? …like a Note 7 ripoff (sans the exploding)? Not knocking the phone, but this would be like if Hyundai made a “Porsche Design Accent.” Hatchback only, of course. EDIT: SWEET> JESUS. I just looked up this phone: http://www.porsche-design.com/en/For-Men/Smartphones-Sound/Porsche-Design-Huawei-Mate-9.html — 1400 EURO (Approx 1480 USD)!!! WTF??? netanil 1) It exists. 2) Deal with it. 3) You don’t have to buy one if you don’t want to. 4) Take your meds. sinfoman I will choose to laugh at this, and not take it personally, but seriously- $1400? That is a STUPID amount of money for any phone. That’s almost 2 brand new note 7s. Or Pixel XLs or… Mr_Esquire_K The Moto Z also works with the headset NexusMan Why would I want to buy a Huawei Daydream headset that only works with Huawei devices? Captain_Doug So happy the Axon 7 made the cut. Wasn’t a big reason why I bought it but I’d be bummed if I couldn’t try daydream with it. Andy How is this device? Camera and battery pretty good? I have a S5 now Jeff “BIG RED” Wait for the S8 Captain_Doug I love it. I average 5 hours SoT. Got 7.5 hours a couple times. Camera is pretty decent. The screen is awesome. Build quality rocks. Stereo front facing speakers is a new must for me. Fingerprint scanner works great. Love that it had a microsd slot. It’s getting Android 7 really soon too. Only $400. Can’t go wrong. needa I was so tempted to buy that phone. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And it’s really not that great of an experience Denvertoad word. Screen door graphics rule!! Bill Mitchell That’s not really an issue with the platform though, just current hardware limitations. I think the software they have in place is pretty good honestly, but we just don’t have the right specs for it yet. Teejay Card I’d just be happy with a Daydream Mark II made by Google. One that relies more on the headset to handle the load. So that way I can get more than 30 minutes with my Pixel XL. If they’re only going to rely on the phone, then us Pixel buyers are as passed over/screwed over as the Nexus 5X and 6P (which of course the 6P was used for development) owners were. Forums galore about overheating and responses from Google don’t give us any reassurance that it can be fixed on the phones end (such as updates). Mostly blamed on a weaker processor, but please don’t take my word for it I know nothing about them. I just think Google could take a great product like they have with Daydream VR and make it much better by delegating resources to the head unit like Samsung does. Idk. Don’t listen to me, I’m drunk. Haha. Here’s to Daydream! Alex Louderback I have literally no issues with overheating, I use Daydream to watch 2+ hours of Netflix and I’ve played over 1 hour sessions of Need For Speed Frank Duque $920! Huawei is crazy! Dorian Brooks I thought Meizu was the company that blatantly knocked off designs. That Mate 9 Pro is more Galaxy S6/7 edge than the Galaxy S6/7 edge. senor_heisenberg Haven’t kept up with daydream requirements, but I’m guessing the phone needs to have an OLED display? Edit: Ah, low latency and low persistence display. tehashi Arg! i couldn’t get a pixel and had to settle for a V20, guess i’m screwed for every trying out Daydream. glimmerman76 thats how LG works About Droid Life We consider ourselves to have the greatest Android community in the world, here at Droid Life.

The acquisition of Limes Audio will help Google offer better online voice quality for customers that use its video conferencing programs, powered by Chromebox for Meetings and Google Hangouts. Google says it’s “critical” that the company provides “a great audio experience” and admitted that one of the biggest challenges to having seamless video meetings is the audio quality. Related Stories Apple Will Invest $1 Billion In SoftBank's Tech Fund Most Searched Things On Google In 2016: Powerball, Election and Olympics “With G Suite customers now relying on video communications for their day-to-day meetings, it's more important than ever to ensure low-cost, high-quality audio,” said Google in a blog post. Limes Audio, which was founded a decade ago, said it was “excited” about the recent move. “We are now very excited to join Google, where we will pursue objectives in line with our passion and continue to work towards all voice conversations sounding equally loud and clear, regardless of the distance or environment,” Limes Audio said in a statement. Audio issues can emerge because of the size of a conference room, which can have an effect on acoustics. Poor internet connection may also distort sounds during calls. However, Google hopes that Limes Audio can jump in and help the company tackle these problems, since the acquired company has been developing solutions that remove distracting noises, distortion and echoes in online conference calls.

For instance, Google, which is very much a staple of modern society, is so prevalent these days that it’s become a verb in itself. The company is much more than a search engine, e-mail platform, cloud-enabled powerpoint, e-calendar or website host—it’s a socially-minded powerhouse. In an additional entry to its wide-ranging list of offerings, the colorful company recently aired its first ever live-streamed music festival dubbed GOODFest, which was billed as a “celebration of progress, positivity, and the power of the people.” Taking place over five days across five separate cities (one event per area), the festival kicked off with a Glass Animals performance in New York on November 29, followed by venues in New Orleans, Seattle, Oakland and Los Angeles throughout December. Each event also promoted a central theme. For example, the Yeah Yeah Yeah’s played for “Humanity” in support of the Equal Justice Initiative for instance, while D.R.A.M. played for “Earth” in an environmentalist perspective backing 350 Seattle. All proceeds went to non-profit organizations, and people watching from their homes via android phones got to sweeten the pot by experiencing the event in VR. If you’re into phenomenal music, good vibes and sponsoring social and environmental change, look out for GOODFests on the horizon that you can physically or digitally attend!

Rise in 'always listening' smart assistants raises major privacy fears At CES gadget show in Las Vegas, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services Authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant  By Associated Press Published: 16:32 EST, 5 January 2017 | Updated: 18:28 EST, 5 January 2017 e-mail 94 shares 49 View comments Alexa, are you spying on me? It's a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow.  At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems.

(AP Photo/John Locher) ALEXA'S TAKEAWAY  Prime members can ask Alexa to reorder from Amazon Restaurants by saying a restaurant name or cuisine type, for example, 'Alexa, order sushi from Amazon Restaurants.'  The service pulls a customer's order history from a specified restaurant or cuisine type and lists meal options available for reorder.  The selected meal is then sent for delivery to a customer's default address.  Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening.  Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as 'Alexa,' it shares what it hears with Amazon's servers to process a response.  Those conversations are then stored indefinitely.  Google's Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo 'has to listen to everything. That's kind of disturbing,' said Ryan O'Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security's threat research center.  'It doesn't capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could.  'You're trusting the devices to not do that, but it's entirely possible.'

Share this article Share 94 shares In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend's home requested the contents of the home's Echo and Amazon's stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence.  The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked.  Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to 'overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.' Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people's privacy. DID ALEXA WITNESS A MURDER?  Amazon said it objects to 'overbroad' requests as a matter of practice Authorities investigating the death of an Arkansas man whose body was found in a hot tub want to expand the probe to include a new kind of evidence: any comments overheard by the suspect's Amazon Echo smart speaker. Amazon said it objects to 'overbroad' requests as a matter of practice, but prosecutors insist their idea is rooted in a legal precedent that's 'as old as Methuselah.' The issue emerged in the slaying of Victor Collins, who was found floating face-up last year in the hot tub at a friend's home in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.  The friend, James Andrew Bates, was later charged with murder. Prosecutors have asked the court to force Amazon to provide data from the Echo that could reveal more clues about the night of Nov. 22, 2015, when Collins was apparently strangled and drowned.    'It's not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,' O'Leary said.  'People say you shouldn't be concerned if you're not doing anything wrong, but that's a dangerous precedent to set.' Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator.  Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo.

For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It's there for those who want to use it, but it's not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon's Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia's Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google's Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung's new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. 'Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children's toys,' said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. 'Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.' Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to 'live forever' online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. WHAT IS AMAZON ECHO?  Amazon Echo is a voice-controlled smart speaker that works alongside a smartphone app. Using a virtual assistant called Alexa, the speaker can respond to voice commands from the user, such as setting an alarm or ordering a cab. Echo also works with services like Spotify as a 360-degree wireless speaker.  The Amazon Echo and smaller Echo Dot speakers were launched in the UK in September in black and white   Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast's Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. 'This is less invasive than that,' he said. 'It's just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.'  A refrigerator with Family Hub 2.0 is on display during a Samsung news conference before CES International, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas.

At CES, Asus announced the Daydream-ready ZenFone AR and ZTE noted that support was coming to the Axon 7 with Nougat. Today, Google announced the addition of Huawei’s Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro, as well as the first third-party Daydream viewer. The ZTE Axon 7 is a great entry for Daydream at the low-end, with its Snapdragon 820 processor and 5.5-inch WQHD AMOLED display. ZTE announced at CES that the Nougat update would be available in the coming “weeks.” Meanwhile, the Asus ZenFone AR doubles as both Daydream-ready and Tango-enabled. Powered by the Snapdragon 821, it features a larger 5.7-inch display and supports augmented reality with a three lens camera stack. Google reiterated that dozens of Tango apps would be coming over the next year. New additions to Daydream, are Huawei’s Mate 9 Pro and Porsche Design Mate 9. Both feature 5.5-inch 2560 x 1440 displays, powered by the non-Qualcomm HiSilicon Kirin 960 processor. Huawei is also announcing the first third-party Daydream viewer that is specifically tailored to these devices. Unlike the Daydream View, the Huawei VR opts for adjustable focus instead of designing enough space for glasses. Similar in appearance to the Gear VR, the phone is attached via plastic clips to a prominently white plastic frame. Besides the single horizontal headband to secure the device, users can string an additional vertical band over their head for a better fit. Pricing and availability are unknown, but the device appears to use the exact same Daydream controller that is included with the View. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Alphabet Inc. announced Wednesday its plans to use VR technology in to help consumers make more informed online purchases. (Dean Hutton/Bloomberg) Google to introduce augmented-reality shopping in new project with Gap, BMW Add to ... ELISABETH BEHRMANN and MARK BERGEN Bloomberg News Published Thursday, Jan. 05, 2017 5:11PM EST Last updated Thursday, Jan. 05, 2017 5:11PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Google is rolling out a real world application for its most ambitious virtual-reality effort: letting shoppers see what they might buy without leaving home. The Alphabet Inc. unit on Wednesday introduced two new retail partnerships, with BMW and Gap Inc., deploying its 3D-scanning project called Tango. The technology uses cameras and sensors in mobile devices to overlay digital images in physical space – akin to the hit mobile game Pokemon Go. The retail deals announced at the consumer technology show CES in Las Vegas hint at Google’s broader ambition to merge its mapping capabilities with its core business of facilitating commerce. As virtual- and augmented-reality technology rapidly improves, analysts predict the retail industry may be one the biggest beneficiaries. IDC estimates the market for the technologies will explode from about $5.2-billion (U.S.) in 2015 to $162-billion in 2020. Car dealerships will be “one of the longer-term, more profitable use cases,” said IDC analyst Chris Chute, as auto makers look for way to reach customers who are increasingly less likely to enter traditional outlets. BMW is testing a new app that displays an i3 city vehicle and i8 sports car on smartphone screens. Car shoppers can walk around the superimposed vehicles, placing it to look life-size inside their driveway or garage. Users can choose from six different colours, four types of trims and wheels, all appearing in a high-resolution image. The Munich-based luxury auto maker said the mobile app will be available at dealerships in 11 countries. “It’s possible we’ll develop a kind of library of models for this app,” said Stefan Biermann, head of innovations for sales for BMW. At a recent presentation in Munich, the display image of an i3, even on a small phone screen, was convincing enough for users to duck and lift their legs to step inside the vehicle, where they could push a button to turn on the lights and the radio. “We see a lot of use of this technology in retail, for measuring your garage or buying big-ticket items like kitchens for example,” Eric Johnsen, who heads business development for augmented reality at Google, said at the event. Bloomberg News reported earlier that Google plans to use the indoor mapping capability of Tango to generate advertising revenue. Mr. Johnsen said Google isn’t getting revenue from sales with its newly announced partnerships, but declined to comment further on business plans. On top of the BMW app, Google announced two more developments for Tango on Wednesday. A new app allows shoppers to test clothes from the Gap brand using Tango. And Google added a new hardware partner: The Zenphone from Asustek Computer Inc. is now compatible with Tango’s technology. However, both announcements reveal the limitations of Google’s efforts. For one, there aren’t many consumers that can try it out. The Asus Zenfone is only the second model to enable Tango, following a device from Lenovo Group Ltd. And it’s still incomplete for consumers that try the technology. With the mobile app for Gap, for instance, shoppers try on outfits using a 3D digital avatar, rather than superimpose the clothes on their bodies. The latter tactic might arrive eventually, but the tech needed is still in its infancy. “Producing content for these mediums is extremely hard,” said Shanna Tellerman, founder of Modsy, a startup that uses three-dimensional technology for e-commerce. “It often looks a little bit janky.” Google is aware of the problem. In addition to challenges with realistic rendering, mobile 3D mapping is constrained by difficulties imposed by lighting and geographic space, said Johnny Lee, director of engineering for Tango. The gap between expectations of the technology and its reality can do more harm than good. “When people think about augmented reality, they think of science-fiction quality effects,” he said. That’s also the rationale behind Google’s cautious implementation of Tango on devices, Mr. Lee explained. While the company ultimately plans for the tech to function inside every mobile device, it now doesn’t reach a vast majority of Android smartphones. Hardware changes demanded from Tango’s sensors also may give Google’s manufacturing partners pause. However, that might change if the tech becomes ubiquitous. Other software companies – Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc. and Snap Inc. – are investing heavily in augmented and virtual reality. Apple Inc. hasn’t revealed any plans for AR, but CEO Tim Cook has touted the technology publicly multiple times. It’s unlikely Apple would allow Google’s Tango to operate on its iPhones. E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. is certainly thinking about virtual reality shopping too, said Mr. Chute, the IDC analyst. All these companies, however, must grapple with the dual challenge of mastering the necessary tech and, more critically, finding an actual market. “Hardware ain’t easy,” Mr. Chute said. “What works in a closed environment, in (Silicon) Valley, doesn’t necessarily work in the real world.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Google signs Internet deal with Cuba's telecommunications monopoly (Reuters)   More Related to this Story Is Google’s AMP helping mobile publishing?

Tell us what you think Bubonic plague bacteria. Scientists argue that, like bubonic plague, Facebook will eventually die out. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images Juliette Garside @JulietteGarside Wednesday 22 January 2014 14.31 EST First published on Wednesday 22 January 2014 14.31 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 years old Facebook has spread like an infectious disease but we are slowly becoming immune to its attractions, and the platform will be largely abandoned by 2017, say researchers at Princeton University (pdf). The forecast of Facebook's impending doom was made by comparing the growth curve of epidemics to those of online social networks. Scientists argue that, like bubonic plague, Facebook will eventually die out. The social network, which celebrates its 10th birthday on 4 February, has survived longer than rivals such as Myspace and Bebo, but the Princeton forecast says it will lose 80% of its peak user base within the next three years. John Cannarella and Joshua Spechler, from the US university's mechanical and aerospace engineering department, have based their prediction on the number of times Facebook is typed into Google as a search term. The charts produced by the Google Trends service show Facebook searches peaked in December 2012 and have since begun to trail off. "Ideas, like diseases, have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out, and have been successfully described with epidemiological models," the authors claim in a paper entitled Epidemiological modelling of online social network dynamics. "Ideas are spread through communicative contact between different people who share ideas with each other. Idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea, which can be thought of as the gain of 'immunity' to the idea." Facebook reported nearly 1.2 billion monthly active users in October, and is due to update investors on its traffic numbers at the end of the month. While desktop traffic to its websites has indeed been falling, this is at least in part due to the fact that many people now only access the network via their mobile phones. For their study, Cannarella and Spechler used what is known as the SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model of disease, which creates equations to map the spread and recovery of epidemics. They tested various equations against the lifespan of Myspace, before applying them to Facebook. Myspace was founded in 2003 and reached its peak in 2007 with 300 million registered users, before falling out of use by 2011. Purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for $580m, Myspace signed a $900m deal with Google in 2006 to sell its advertising space and was at one point valued at $12bn. It was eventually sold by News Corp for just $35m. The 870 million people using Facebook via their smartphones each month could explain the drop in Google searches – those looking to log on are no longer doing so by typing the word Facebook into Google. But Facebook's chief financial officer David Ebersman admitted on an earnings call with analysts that during the previous three months: "We did see a decrease in daily users, specifically among younger teens." Investors do not appear to be heading for the exit just yet. Facebook's share price reached record highs this month, valuing founder Mark Zuckerberg's company at $142bn. Facebook billionaire When Facebook shares hit their peak in New York this week, it meant Sheryl Sandberg's personal fortune ticked over $1bn (£600m), making her one of the youngest female billionaires in the world. According to Bloomberg, the 44-year-old chief operating officer of the social network owns about 12.3m shares in the company, which closed at $58.51 (£35) on Tuesday in New York, although they fell back below $58 on Wednesday. Her stake is valued at about $750m. Her fortune has risen rapidly since last August, when she sold $91m of shares and was estimated to be worth $400m. Sandberg has collected more than $300m from selling shares since the company's 2012 initial public offering, and owns about 4.7m stock options that began vesting last May. "She was brought in to figure out how to make money," David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect, a history of the company, told Bloomberg. "It's proving to be one of the greatest stories in business history." Sandberg's rise in wealth mirrors her broadening role on the global stage. The Harvard University graduate and one-time chief of staff for former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers is a donor to President Barack Obama, sits on the board of Walt Disney Co, and wrote the book Lean In. She will be discussing gender issues with IMF boss Christine Lagarde at Davos on Saturday.

Chrome users who put their browser into developer mode and install the extension – by dragging the AdNauseam .crx file onto the extension management page – will see it install. But Google overrides that choice, presenting a prompt that says, "To make Chrome safer, we have disabled the following extension that isn't listed in the Chrome Web Store and may have been added without your knowledge." Google's action does not entirely preclude the possibility of using the software. Because AdNauseam is open-source software, a developer can install his or her own version of the code as a local extension or through enterprise policy. The makers of AdNauseam have provided instructions to do so. Google in 2013 banned ad blocking for Android apps in the Google Play Store, for violating its prohibition on interfering with the function of other apps. It conducted another purge in early 2016, banning stand-alone ad blocking apps like Adblock Fast and Crystal. It subsequently formalized its stance with a Play Store policy update, allowing browsers with built-in content blocking support to remain. Ad blocking continues to hurt online publishers, even as some acknowledge that ad-driven online media is a "broken system." Internet users who block online ads cite security, page load performance, and privacy among their reasons for doing so. Web technology has traditionally been more open than native code on mobile devices, but over the past few years, Google has tightened control over its browser – urged on, the company claims, by complaints from users. In May 2014, Google implemented a new policy, ostensibly to protect Windows users, by requiring that Chrome extensions be hosted on the Chrome Web Store. According to a May 2015 blog post written by Google extensions platform product manager Jake Leichtling, the policy was a success, reducing customer support help requests to remove unwanted extensions by 75 per cent. As a result, Google extended its Chrome extension oversight to Windows and Mac users. According to Leichtling, Google originally did not enforce this policy for developers. But he said that malicious software took advantage of the exception and forced users into the developer channel to install off-store extensions. Consequently, in July 2015, Google applied its malware enforcement mechanism to general release and developer Chrome channels. AdNauseam's stated goal is "to obfuscate browsing data and protect users from tracking by advertising networks" and to serve as "a means of amplifying users' discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and facilitate bulk surveillance agendas." It thus opposes the current, largely unrestrained practices of the online advertising business, upon which Google depends. The creators of the software, Daniel C Howe, Mushon Zer-Aviv, and Helen Nissenbaum, characterize AdNauseam as a form of protest against online surveillance. "We are attempting to bring to light a system that has taken over the web, whereby ads are just the tip of the iceberg and serve as a delivery system for a massive back-end surveillance architecture that tracks us from site to site," the trio explain on the project's Github repository. "It is not advertising we are protesting, but advertising insofar as it represents a dominant means of tracking users without their consent." Google did not respond to a request to explain its decision to disable AdNauseam. It informed the company, "An extension should have a single purpose that is clear to users..." "Frankly it is quite patronizing to argue users don't know what they're doing when they install AdNauseam, especially since they need to explicitly allow AdNauseam to hide and click ads and to completely block malicious ads," Zer-Aviv said in an email to The Register. "They are spying on us, we're trying to protect against that and we're flagged as malware?" AdNauseam is based on uBlock, a popular open-source ad blocking application. But it takes ad blocking a step further by clicking on the ads it has hidden, in order to pollute behavioral profiles used for ad targeting. In so doing, it costs advertisers money (which arguably gets wasted anyway). In online discussions, people have suggested that automated ad clicking meets the legal definition of fraud. Zer-Aviv disputes this claim. "Unlike click fraud, we do not benefit financially from these clicks," he said. "Moreover, users of the web are not signed on any financial agreement that limits what they can or cannot click online. If the banner is there, it is clickable." Zer-Aviv acknowledged that such clicks could be counted as billable ads, but he suggests it's appropriate to attempt to impose costs on an advertising system that fails to respect privacy. He said, "...this is where we're deliberately trying to offset the financial incentives of the surveillance advertising model." Zer-Aviv and his colleagues have submitted another version of AdNauseam that they hope Google will allow. "We switched the language of the start page from 'Block Malware' to 'Block Malicious Ads' which clarifies everything we do is about our privacy solution," he said. "We also have new features that we were going to launch anyway, like making exception for sites that respect the Do Not Track standard, and estimating how much money do these ad clicks end up costing, and other minor improvements."

Germain • LinuxInsider • ECT News Network Jan 5, 2017 2:27 PM PT Ecommerce marketers have discovered a way to make more money while better engaging their customers at scale. By using Klaviyo to target, personalize & optimize their emails, companies like Chubbies & Huckberry see better results. Try Klaviyo for Free. Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles this week showcased a new in-auto infotainment platform at CES in Las Vegas. The open source system combines Uconnect with Android Auto. The companies demonstrated their concept design inside a Chrysler 300 sedan at the show. The new system is built around Android 7.0, or Nougat, and an 8.4-inch Uconnect system. The integration of Android and Uconnect enables a system built for connectivity and compatibility with the universe of popular Android applications. The demo highlighted integration with Google Assistant, Google Maps, and popular Android apps including Pandora, Spotify, NPR One and Pocket Casts. The latest version of Android Auto includes core infotainment features such as radio and comfort controls. The concept infotainment platform is separate from the companies' self-driving car project, dubbed "Waymo." That project involves deploying Google's autonomous vehicle technology to a fleet of 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans. The hybrid concept system goes beyond Google's Android Auto system released in 2015. Android Auto allows mobile devices running Android to operate in automobiles through the dashboard's head unit. The digital technology breakthrough may steer car makers away from non-open source in-car solutions, suggested Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "The computerization of automobiles has been progressing rapidly, but less clear has been the process through which automakers will embrace digital entertainment," he told LinuxInsider. "Major players, particularly Apple, have been moving in that direction -- but there have been suggestions that automakers would prefer to avoid highly proprietary technologies and platforms." Benevolent Progress The agreement between FCA and Google certainly supports the trend, King said, noting that Android offers a highly open and edible environment for building automobile entertainment systems. "Plus, the platform's maturity and growing popularity should help assure FCA that its Android investments will pay long-term dividends," he added. "Overall, this should be a good deal for both companies and FCA customers, and could lead to other automakers adopting Android." The collaboration with Google helps both companies explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technologies continue to evolve. It also will help both companies meet consumers' increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction, noted Chris Barman, head of electrical engineering at FCA. "With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android's features and ecosystem of applications," he said. Further, the collaborative efforts support Google's commitment to building Android as a turnkey automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way, noted Patrick Brady, director of Android engineering at Google. "This collaboration with FCA brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age," he said. Mixed Reviews The Android Auto-Uconnect integration may fall short of Earth-shattering, as it is powered by existing technology. The innovation is based on an open source operating system that includes some proven apps. Android is based on Linux, arguably the most popular operating system in IoT because it is free and can be stripped back to limit resource consumption, observed Mike Pittenger, vice president of security strategy at Black Duck. "A bigger deal would be using a commercial OS," he told LinuxInsider, "but why would you ever pay for an OS in the Internet of Things?" Still, merging Android with Uconnect suggests an expansion of the role of open source technology in the automotive industry. "Open source is going to play a bigger role in all software," Pittenger said. "New automobiles have hundreds of millions of lines of software, making automotive companies large developers and integrators. Using more open source, and thereby reducing costs and accelerating time to market, makes a lot of sense." Jack M. Germain has been writing about computer technology since the early days of the Apple II and the PC. He still has his original IBM PC-Jr and a few other legacy DOS and Windows boxes. He left shareware programs behind for the open source world of the Linux desktop. He runs several versions of Windows and Linux OSes and often cannot decide whether to grab his tablet, netbook or Android smartphone instead of using his desktop or laptop gear.

Here are three certifications to consider this year. By Brandon Vigliarolo | January 5, 2017, 1:19 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/artisteer Mobile computing accounts for more than half the traffic to the average website and that figure is only growing. That puts mobile developers in a good position to land a new job—but how do you get the training and certification needed? Mobile app development only really comes in two flavors: Android and Apple's Swift. Master one of them—along with a healthy dose of Java and JavaScript—and you'll be ready to tackle the mobile development world. Android developer certification Like it or not, there are a lot more Android devices out there than iOS ones. If you're looking to enter the mobile development world in order to find the first available job then getting an Android certification is probably the best bet. Google offers its own Associate Android Developer certification, which can be obtained through Google's developer certification site. Don't jump the gun and sign up just yet: Google doesn't offer any training for Android developer certification. If you sign up now without having the requisite knowledge you'll be wasting your time and money. SEE: Survey: Spending on enterprise mobile apps is up, will continue to increase for the next three years (TechRepublic) Luckily Google partners with Udacity to offer a full Google Developer Certification course. It's currently discounted to $99 (from $149), so if you're thinking of getting a jump on Android developer certification now is the time. Swift developer certification Swift is Apple's iOS development language. It's based on a mixture of C and Objective C, so it should be a bit familiar to anyone with experience in those languages. Apple doesn't offer a Swift certification, unfortunately, which means relying on the credibility of third-party certifiers. The most trustworthy of the programs offered comes from Coursera, which offers a five-week online course in programming for iOS with Swift. At the end of the course you'll be awarded with a certificate from Coursera. SEE: New report claims there are 12 million mobile developers, and that's not nearly enough (TechRepublic) The course was created by the University of Toronto and enrollment ends January 9th. Hurry if you want to get in on the action! Caveat emptor: There's no standard for how far a Coursera certification will get you. It will look good to some potential employers but it simply isn't as good as a certification straight from Apple. Java Java is the backbone Android was built on, so it makes sense to consider a certification in Java development. The certs are offered straight from Oracle and you can find training classes as well. You may want to consider looking elsewhere for Java training, though: The basic level course is $2,325. No love for JavaScript? Reputable JavaScript certifications are nonexistent. The only way you're going to get a certification with JavaScript in the name is by taking Microsoft's Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3 course. Even then, the class isn't focusing solely on JavaScript. JavaScript isn't a mobile programming language as such, but it is used everywhere on the web and mobile sites. It's a simple, easy-to-learn language that is essential for any new mobile developer. Even if you don't want to take a certification course in it there's still a lot of benefit available from learning the basics. Interested in the mobile end of the enterprise?

This was later confirmed by the company as having to do with a "last minute bug". It was eventually fixed and Google promised that the Nexus 6's first taste of Android 7.1.1 would become available in early January. Well, here we are. It's early January alright, and if you're the impatient type who doesn't mind using the command line from time to time, you can grab a factory image or OTA zip file from Google's developer site and flash either to your Nexus 6 to make it run the absolute latest iteration of Android. We assume the January security patches are included too, and hopefully the over-the-air rollout will start soon - to get this to people who don't want to mess with ADB. Unfortunately though, it may be a while before every Nexus 6 still out there gets the coveted update notification, seeing as how there still are devices in the wild that are stuck on the October or November security patch level, having received no subsequent updates to this point.

Last year, Google added a new “Goals” feature to Google Calendar, allowing users to schedule goals for various recurring activities such as workouts, however users who wanted to keep track of their goals were required to mark them completed manually. The latest version of Google Calendar for iOS can now read workout data directly from Apple’s Health app, allowing daily workout goals to be automatically marked as completed within the Google Calendar app. The app can also now use workout data from HealthKit to tailor future goal schedules to times that more accurately reflect actual workout times.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on January 5, 2017January 5, 2017 by Press Release SEO 2017: 5 Rock-Solid Strategies to Help You Rank To succeed with SEO in 2017 you need trust. Trust is the core component of Google’s relevancy-oriented search. Without trust, you’re simply not relevant. Yet, building trust is a double-edged sword and somewhat of a catch-22. For newcomers, especially, gaining visibility without trust has become incredibly difficult. However, without visibility, how are people supposed to garner those all-important shares and links to your content? If someone can’t discover your article, how are they supposed to engage with it and like it enough to send it to their friends or share it on social media? Clearly, in the beginning, the odds are stacked up against us. But there is a way forward.  Trust is most certainly the pathway to Google’s heart, if there ever was such a thing. And by leveraging this understanding of trust, we can succeed with SEO to make money online, build passive income streams and build a successful business in the long term — as long as we play by Google’s many rules.  At the core of Google’s relevancy equation, trust itself is created through three fundamental pillars. Within those three pillars, there are more than 200 different factors that help to comprise the search giant’s core algorithms. Once you understand these fundamental pillars, you can work on building up your trust across each of these areas.  But before I launch into a discussion about that — and convey some of the strategies that will allow you to explode your presence by using the inherent power of search engine optimization — let me give you a bit of history. You see, the reason why it’s so difficult to dominate Google’s search results is because the search engine has been scorned once too often.  As Google’s search grew over the years and turned into the dominant player that it is today, people realized the importance of ranking high organically. Clearly, the near-limitless amount of free traffic can send any business into the stratosphere. Everyone knows that, and because of it, everyone is drawn to it.  Yet, over time, as people understood how the system worked, they began to take advantage of certain less-than-scrupulous strategies that allowed them to rank their content quickly at the top of Google’s search. These weren’t the most relevant search results, which enraged Google. Because of that, Google knew things had to change.  Related: Get Prepared for the Future of SEO As an upshot, SEO has seen some dramatic upheavals in recent years at the behest of Google and its core mission to cultivate an internet to wield more inherent value for the global populous. And while things have calmed down recently, the last five years has seen a massive overhaul in the way Google determines what the most relevant search result is.  SEO algorithm updates. Before you can really understand what it takes to rocket up Google’s Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) in 2017, you have to digest what’s changed. The reason? The changes are integral to the bigger picture and just what Google’s intentions are with the web.  Google’s main aim is to deliver the most relevant search result in the quickest manner possible. Clearly, it’s perfected that. So much so that it digitally obliterated its competition, vastly skewing the major market share towards its powerful search, while making the company a household name in the process.  The algorithm updates that have been put in play have gone by names like Panda, Penguin, and more recently, Hummingbird, amongst droves of others. These algorithm updates have been intended to improve the user experience, eliminate spam and scams, and to increase the overall relevancy of search.  By understanding what’s changed, you can gain perspective into Google’s intentions on what it’s attempting to achieve. It desires content that helps to improve the lives of others, delivers value and that users want to engage with. Those are the most relevant search results. That’s what Google is after. But for years, it got quite the opposite. It dealt with unscrupulous individuals attempting to “game” the system.  How to dominate SEO in 2017. In a book entitled SEO 2017: Master Search Engine Optimization, I lay the groundwork for Google’s trust, which is represented by three fundamental pillars. These pillars are integral to Google’s relevancy equation, and if you fail to address each of these pillars of trust, you’ll find yourself floundering in a sea of competition, unable to gain the precious visibility that you’re after.  1. Age Age is more than a number. Google relies on its relationship with you over time to judge just how much it can trust you. The longer it’s known about you and the more often it sees you creating high-quality content that delivers tremendous amounts of value, the more it’s going to trust you.  Age also doesn’t rely on the date you first purchased your domain. Age refers to the indexed age, meaning when Google actually discovered your domain. If you buy a domain and leave it dormant for years, that won’t help you. You have to actually do something with it.  2. Authority The second pillar of trust is authority. Google relies on other sites that it already trusts to determine what newcomers should be trusted. If you have a site with great content, and other websites that Google already trusts are linking to you organically, your trust will naturally increase over time.  However, building authority is incredibly difficult at the outset. When you’re new, and you’re unable to get discovered at the top of Google’s SERPs, how are people supposed to find you and subsequently link to you? Unless you quite literally go viral, you have a steep uphill battle ahead of you, but authority is also incredibly important to your overall ability to rank.  3. Content The third underlying component of trust is content. Your content plays a large role in your visibility on Google’s SERPs. Simply put, you can’t push out subpar content and expect to gain traction. Your content has to deliver enormous amounts of value if you’re serious about attaining the search giant’s attention.  But it’s not just about one-off content. You need to regularly deliver great content on your site, the kind that people want to share and engage with. Without great content, you have nothing, and no matter what SEO strategy you employ, it will fail. No one will link to a site with poor content. Don’t waste your time by trying to cut corners or take shorcuts. Content is most certainly still king.  Related: Building a Keyword-Driven Content-Marketing Strategy Is Key  Five SEO strategies to help you rank in 2017. Beyond these three pillars of trust, there are more than 200 ranking factors that are involved in Google’s search. These ranking factors run the gamut from obvious to obscure. For example, one such ranking factor is just how long remains before your domain name expires. The rationale is that domains that are registered for a short period — such as a year — are more likely fly-by-night sites. The longer the domain is registered for, the more likely it’s going to be to stick around. While this is a small relevancy signal, it just goes to show you some of the obscurity involved in ranking factors of Google’s algorithms.  Strategy 1 — Market your content One of the most important SEO strategies to use in 2017 is content marketing. At the heart of this strategy is high-quality content that delivers a tremendous amount of value. This so-called “anchor content” is located on your website. However, it doesn’t end there. You need to market that content on authority sites such as Quora, Reddit, WiseLike, LinkedIn and other highly-trafficked destinations on the web.  Engaging in content marketing is not easy by any measure, but this single SEO strategy will help you rocket just about any of your listings to the top of Google’s SERPs over time, as long as it’s done the right way. To do this, there’s a very specific method. You have to ensure that you build similar and relevant content that’s keyword specific on authority sites such as Medium.com, LinkedIn.com and Quora.com, and that the content has a single link from the authority site back to the main anchor content on your primary domain. Strategy 2 — Improve page speed The page speed of your site has a big influence on the user’s experience. Slow-loading pages take away from the user experience, while fast-loading pages help to add to it. Google is acutely concerned with the user’s overall experience, and improving the page speed is one such way you can drastically improve that experience.  Use tools such as Google’s Page Speed, GTMetrix or Varvy’s Page Speed Tool to run insights and gain suggestions on how to improve your site’s page speed. If you’re not technically savvy, you might need to enlist the help of a web developer to optimize your site’s page speed.  Strategy 3 — Focus on mobile and AMP Google has made a concerted push to mobile. Considering that mobile searches are now far surpassing desktop searches, it’s no wonder the search giant is so focused on mobile. However, most people are still behind the curve when it comes to mobile. Their sites load properly on desktop browsers, but not on mobile devices or even tablets.  Related: Google’s New Mobile-First Index and the Death of Desktop SEO Leverage a responsive design for your site, if you presently don’t have one right now, to ensure that your site is optimized for mobile devices. Google has also recently launched its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project, which further increases mobile load times. You can learn more about the AMP specification here.  Strategy 4 — Leverage the power of videos Whether it’s 2017, or any other year for that matter, every SEO strategy needs the power of video marketing. Videos take your content into the stratosphere due to the popularity of video platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo. Creating useful tutorials and other informative videos are also a great way to deliver real value to people in a multimedia format that’s easily accessible to anyone with a smartphone camera.  Build relevant videos to further deliver the point made in a particular article on your site, and ensure that the description is keyword rich — but not keyword stuffed. Leverage elements such as the title and tags to fuse the keyword-centric nature of your video content. Strategy 5 — Be social and engage with others Authority is built up over time, but it also can’t be built up unless you’re social and you engage with others. In the beginning, they won’t come to you. In fact, what you’ve likely noticed is that it’s incredibly hard to rank any content at the outset. That’s because most newcomers have very little age and very little authority. So you have to get out there and build it. This isn’t just about sharing your content repeatedly with others. You can’t simply cheerlead your own cause and expect to get ahead. You need to be social, add value to conversations, follow others and take an interest in what those people are doing if you want them to take an interest in you.  R.L.

The session held at IIT-Kharagpur was titled ‘A journey back to the past to inspire the future’ in which Pichai narrated his life on campus. Here’s what he said: 1. Pichai started his interaction with the students by narrating his experience at IIT-Kharagpur. “Getting into IITs involves a lot of hard work. However, getting into a prestigious institute doesn't ensure success,” he said. 2. The Google CEO also pointed out difficulties in calling girls from their hostels when there were no smartphones. Incidentally, his wife Anjali and Sundar were classmates. Narrating a personal experience when on campus, Sundar said: “I met Anjali at IIT-K and she was my classmate. Just to go get someone at the girl’s hostel, you had to walk in the front and request someone to call them. And they’d go in and loudly say – Anjali, Sundar is here. It wasn’t exactly a pleasant experience.” 3. When asked how things had changed in terms of technology, he said, “We didn’t have phones back then. I remember waiting for a long time to get a rotary phone at home. Didn’t have access to computers growing up. Clearly the progress has been phenomenal.” 4. Sundar recalled an incident from his college days where he called out to someone saying, ‘Abey Saale’. “As a freshman, couple of weeks into being here.. I came from Chennai. I had learnt Hindi in school but never spoke much. Just listening to other people, I thought that’s how you address people. One day, there was someone in the mess, and I had to call him, and I called him Abey Saale. In my first couple of weeks I thought you call people that way. Next thing, I know folks in the mess were quite upset, and they closed down the mess temporarily.” 5. “Don't feel the pressure of what others are telling you. Devote time to what you love,” said Pichai on managing time between academics and extracurricular activities at IITs. 6. One of the most interesting incidents he narrated to the gathering at Kharagpur was about his interview at Google. “I interviewed at Google on April 1, 2004, which is April Fool’s Day. Google had just announced Gmail and it was invite-only. But people weren’t exactly sure if it was an April Fool’s joke. So, I remember doing my interviews during the day and people kept asking me what do you think of Gmail, but I didn’t have a chance to use it and I thought it was an April Fool’s joke.” 7. From his initial days of college he said he was ragged pretty mellow. As a freshman, he once came back to find everything, including clothes and furniture in his hostel room, rearranged despite the door being locked. "I was made to carry baggage across the railway platform at Kharagpur station by my seniors -- and it is a long platform." he recalled. 8. Pichai said he often jokes that the only reason he got into Google was because co-founder and Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page did not interview him. “I still joke that I got into Google because Larry didn’t interview me,” he said. 9. On a question from one of the students on the power he wields at Google as CEO and whether he could arrange a Google Doodle for his alma mater, Pichai promptly took his phone out of his pocket saying, “Let me just text my team to do that”. However, he explained that the organisation has set certain standards for when a Doodle is to be put out and how, and said that the institution deserves to be celebrated, and that he will be looking forward to putting the institute on Google Doodle in the most “thoughtful way possible.” 10. Pichai also said, “It's shocking that people start preparing for IITs in their 8th grade. It's absolutely okay if you don't make it to IITs. Life is much bigger than that and it really doesn't matter whether you are from IIT or not.” X From Our Network SOPOSTED This 5-Year-Old Kid Earns Rs 6.5 crores A Month. Wanna Know What He Does??

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday January 16, 2017 Larger / SmallerNight Mode Street View Streaker's charges dropped, but she says she'd do it again Shane Hendrickson 5 Jun 2015, 6:30 a.m. PORT PIRIE: Charges dropped for woman who put SA city on the map by flashing a Google Street View camera. The famous view captured by Google's cameras. The woman who put Port Pirie on the map for flashing a Google Street View camera has had her charges dropped, but says she would do it again. Karen Davis, who was charged with disorderly behaviour, made headlines around the world, but ruffled a few feathers along the way. “At least it hasn’t gone to court. No fine, just a letter to say ‘don’t do it again!’” Ms Davis said. Despite the feathers ruffled, she says she wants to do it again next time the camera car comes to town “I have no regrets. It is just a shame some people took it so badly because it was not my intention to offend anyone,” she said.  “I want to start a movement and do it in a big group. If we wear a mask they won’t know it’s us. Sunrise host Samantha Armytage said she would do it with me.” One particular issue that fuelled the story was a police statement that her “actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals”. “That was an absolute disgrace and part of the reason I want to do it again,” Ms Davis said. Karen Davis became a global sensation after her appearance on Google Street View. Media groups that picked up Ms Davis’ story ranged globally and the story was even covered by Playboy men’s magazine. “I have always said I would do Playboy, but they haven’t contacted me,” Ms Davis said. “I think the council should pay me for getting this town on the map. Africa, Germany, Switzerland, America; they all know Port Pirie.” Source: The Recorder Latest News Hunter fish files | PHOTOS Baird urged to curb Coast’s airport plans One Nation leader Pauline Hanson invited to Donald Trump's presidential inauguration Hot weather set to return | PHOTOS Explainer: What election candidates can and can't say on social media Editor's Picks Airshow to honour pilot Gerard Beiboer | PHOTOS, VIDEO FLASHBACK: Woolworths bombing 1980 | PHOTOS The Elf on the Shelf is back | PHOTOS High Street Maitland Woolworths reunion | gallery Springfest returns Saturday | PHOTOS Popular FLASHBACK: Woolworths bombing 1980 | PHOTOS High Street Maitland Woolworths reunion | gallery Roos behind fences during Great Race Get on the buses to avoid any problems Done just in the nick of time Multimedia +more multimedia stories Photos Video Interactive Hunter fish files | PHOTOS There’s some mighty big fish in here!

TECHNOLOGY How Amazon Is Beating Google and Apple With a Little Help From Its Friends Despite not having an official presence at CES, Amazon has been the talk of the show thanks to the ubiquity of its Alexa voice assistant. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT The "Alexa family" of Amazon's Echo virtual assistant. CREDIT: Amazon Advertisement Amazon has a history of keeping a low profile at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, but so far, the online retailer has stolen the limelight at the 2017 edition of the tech conference thanks to Alexa, its popular artificial intelligence-powered virtual voice assistant. Alexa has been an early hit at the Las Vegas conference as several new products have been announced with integrations that use the Amazon assistant, such as LG's new refrigerator, an air purifier, and even a humanoid robot. "We have a rich pipeline of Alexa voice service equipment that will be released over the coming months," said Mike George, Amazon's vice president of Echo and Alexa, at the LG press event at CES on Tuesday, according to GeekWire. Since the 2015 debut of the Echo speaker, Amazon has made headway in the artificial intelligence market with products that let users easily put Alexa to use through various commands. These include asking Alexa for information about sports or the weather, asking her to set reminders, or requesting music from Spotify. Seemingly out of left field, Amazon's Alexa has risen as a formidable foe against the likes of Apple's Siri, Google's Now, and Microsoft's Cortana. After the embarrassing flop of the Fire Phone, Amazon was left out of the lucrative smartphone market, unlike chief rivals Google and Apple. That setback forced Amazon to get resourceful by releasing products for the home that at first blush seemed like little more than smart speakers that let their owners order more trash bags or light bulbs with a verbal command. Now, at CES 2017, Amazon is looking to expand beyond the Echo's core functionality with integrations that will place Alexa in smart products consumers can purchase for any part of their homes. "Amazon is taking a smart approach by making its software compatible with other products," said Mark Clifton, CEO and founder of Princeton Identity, an identity management company. "If Google, Apple, and Microsoft are to compete with Amazon, they'll need to make a tough decision about how compatible and open they choose to be." "Amazon has a real first-mover advantage in building a community of third-party developers and device manufacturers," said Jason Krikorian, general partner at DCM Ventures. This strategy of working with outside parties, which has been hailed by analysts, leaves Google and Microsoft playing catch-up. When Microsoft's Windows rose to prominence, the Redmond, Washington, company persuaded partners to integrate its operating system into their desktop computers. Similarly, Google's Android became Apple's chief rival after Google partnered with phone manufacturers. Now, Amazon is expanding its established dominance of the virtual assistant market in the exact same way. "Alexa isn't technically an OS per se, but it fulfills a similar role," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "It's become very clear this week that Alexa is by far the voice platform of choice even for vendors who use Android for much of their hardware." Though Microsoft's Cortana assistant lives on Windows, the company's hardly used phones, and the Xbox One, it has gained little traction. At this point, it's essentially a lost cause. Apple's Siri and Google Now still dominate their respective smartphones, but Alexa has proven that demand for a virtual assistant goes beyond a device that sits in your hand or your pocket. "Alexa is clearly having incredible momentum, and it's a compelling value proposition to integrate a new consumer electronic device with Amazon's Alexa ecosystem," said Johnny Won, founder of Hyperstop, a tech consulting firm. "But," he added, "with the way voice activation works, this race is far from over." Published on: Jan 5, 2017 Advertisement

It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Free e-book on the state of identity management in government. Download now Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. Advertisement So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as “Alexa,” it shares what it hears with Amazon’s servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google’s Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo “has to listen to everything. That’s kind of disturbing,” said Ryan O’Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security’s threat research center. “It doesn’t capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You’re trusting the devices to not do that, but it’s entirely possible.” In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend’s home requested the contents of the home’s Echo and Amazon’s stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to “overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people’s privacy. “It’s not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,” O’Leary said. “People say you shouldn’t be concerned if you’re not doing anything wrong, but that’s a dangerous precedent to set.” Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It’s there for those who want to use it, but it’s not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon’s Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia’s Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google’s Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung’s new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. “Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children’s toys,” said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. “Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.” Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to “live forever” online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast’s Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. “This is less invasive than that,” he said. “It’s just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.” ___ Bree Fowler reported from New York.

Google’s 3-D-scanning, depth-sensing technology Tango, which uses special cameras and sensors in mobile devices to overlay digital images in physical space, announced two new retail partnerships with BMW and Gap at CES yesterday. With the new technology, BMW is reportedly testing a new mobile app to display 3-D renderings of its two new vehicle models — i3 city vehicle and i8 sports car — that shoppers can walk around, placing it to look lifesize inside their driveway or garage. With the app, users can alter the image to feature different colors, trims and wheels to find the best fit. Gap will be using the Tango technology to allow shoppers to test fit clothes via mobile app. These partnerships hint at where the future success of handheld AR lies — in the retail and vehicle industries. For now, the technology is limited in its scope, as only two smartphone models currently feature the capability — the Lenovo augmented reality (AR) smartphone and recently the ZenFone from Asustek Computer Inc. The majority of Android phones aren’t enabled to handle Tango’s AR. But AR features are the next frontier for many tech and software companies. Microsoft, Facebook and Snapchat are all investing in both AR and virtual reality (VR) research and development. Apple has hinted at working with AR, though it has announced nothing specific. Some businesses already have AR functions for pre-purchase trials and design planning, like Nordstrom, Adidas and Sephora’s virtual fitting rooms, or 3-D home décor modeling like the kind HSN rolled out in September. The current hype surrounding AR can draw in new customers to a brand that implements it, while AR’s ability to increase user participation can work toward customer retention. The International Data Corporation estimates that the market for AR and VR technologies is set to boom — projecting growth from about $5.2 billion in 2015 to $162 billion in 2020 as the technologies rapidly improve and become less expensive to produce and distribute. Globally, 59 percent of companies reportedly plan to develop or use AR in some capacity in the next year. In North America, where a majority of AR developments are expected to originate in these early years, that number is 62 percent.

By Julia Malacoff | Jan 05, 2017 Topics:  resolutions, fitness tips, healthy tech, Personal Best If you're a Google Calendar user, you probably already know that you can add the goals you want to achieve directly into your calendar, which is a pretty handy feature if you've got something big you want to accomplish on your radar. For those who aren't familiar, the feature automatically schedules time in your calendar for whatever goal you've got going on, making it harder to forget that you're supposed to do it. Today, the company announced that they're making this idea even better—just in time for those working on health and fitness New Year's resolutions. Since Google recently learned that 40 percent of people are setting goals related to fitness with this feature, the update makes a lot of sense. Now, you'll be able to connect the goals you set to Google Fit or Apple Health, meaning that all your info from those apps will be transferred into your calendar and synced with your goals. For example, if you want to work out right after work at 6 PM five days a week, but you usually don't make it to the gym until 7 PM, your calendar will learn that and move your workout to that time in the future. So smart! (BTW, not every goal needs to be totally within reach. Here's how setting a big lofty goal can actually work in your favor.) Also, once you've reached your goal via your tracking app of choice, your calendar will now automatically mark it as done. Then, you can keep your overall progress towards your goal all in one handy place automatically, rather than having to compile all the information yourself and mark your goal as complete every time you work on it. While technology can sometimes distract us from our health and fitness goals, this feature is a prime example of how it can help make staying on top of your fitness routine significantly easier.

There was no doubt left on the chilly morning at the open air theatre on Thursday that the Google CEO is possibly the most prominent alumnus of the premier engineering school, which has produced some of India’s top technocrats. Usually shy, even Pichai could not have missed out the electric atmosphere. It was easy to see that Pichai, who graduated from IIT-Kharagpur in 1993, armed with a degree in metallurgical engineering, was enjoying every moment as around 3,500 students hung on to his words, laughed at every joke and bid him adieu with a thunderous applause. For the Google CEO it was a day to connect with the next generation of tech superstars. He dealt with a variety of questions from how to get a job in Google to his GPA score, and he replied to each one with the same calm and poise. Pichai joked how the dorm where he stayed “looks exactly the same”. He also noted how the Kharagpur station has changed since it now has Wi-Fi. The Chennai-born Pichai also joked about how he thought ‘abbe sale’ was a greeting and not an abuse. Pichai recounted how he met his wife, Anjali, while at IIT, but pointed out how every time he went to meet her at the girls’ hostel, access to which was hard, the trip would be somewhat embarrassing as someone would stand outside and shout loudly, “Anjali, Sundar is here for you”. Wishing that he had a smartphone back then, Pichai said, “Technology, especially the mobile phone, has reshaped the world…Clearly, the progress has been phenomenal.” Pichai also talked of how hard it was to get into IIT, adding that like all students he also bunked classes.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Devotees take holy dip on Makar Sankranti Madurai group defies ban on Jallikattu Hyderabad hosts world kite festival Thailand Flood kills 25, damages overland routes CFPF Jeet Singh's video viral over discrimination Second Scorpene class submarine launched Arun Jaitly on GST at Vibrant Gujarat summit 2017 Wont let SP split, says Mulayam 'Acche din' only with Congress: Rahul Videos Priyanka Chopra resting after accident on 'Quantico'...

Applications by Carrie Mihalcik January 5, 2017 11:56 AM PST @CDMihalcik Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Google wants to help you stick to your fitness goals in Calendar. Photo by Google Just when you were ready to ditch that New Year's resolution to go running every morning, Google is here to help. Well, it's here to help people who use the Goals feature in Google Calendar. Google on Thursday said you can now connect Google Fit and Apple Health to your fitness goals in Calendar. "When you do, activity in your favorite fitness apps will be recorded and used to mark your goals in Google Calendar as 'done' automatically," reads a post about the update. Before the update, you'd have to manually mark the goal as done in Google Calendar, even if you were also using fitness apps to track your activity. Google introduced the Goals feature last year, promising to help you find time in your busy schedule to achieve goals like working out, spending time with family or developing a skill. The feature uses machine learning -- the same kind of algorithms it uses to deliver search results, help translate languages and identify objects in photos -- to find the best time window for your goal and pencils it into your calendar. Calendar will also automatically reschedule goals if a conflict comes up or if you're always late. For example, if you set a goal to run at 6:30 every morning, but don't actually get moving until 7:15 most days, Calendar will reschedule the goal for you. Plus, there's a shiny "new visual performance tracker" to help you see how you're doing. Because who doesn't like to watch their resolutions soar, or in most cases, crash and burn.

The search giant has been sending its Go-playing artificial intelligence AlphaGo into online arenas to match up against players around the world—and it's been trouncing the competition. AlphaGo crept into the online games hosted on Tygem and FoxGo servers—two popular hangouts for competitive Go players to match wits. Playing under the username Master or Magister, the AI began to rattle off win after win against some tough competition. As its wins continued to pile up, Chinese professional Go player Gu Li offered up a 100,000 yuan (about $14,500) reward to anyone able to knock off Master. Around the time it hit a record of 50 wins and zero losses, players started wondering if there was something other than another human behind the unbeatable account. On a subreddit dedicated to strategy games, theories of the Master account's true identity ranged from world Go champion Lee Sedol to a Chinese-built AI to, most improbably of all, the 1,000 year old spirit of a Go master from Japanese manga series Hikaru no Go. While none of the guesses were quite correct, players were catching on to the oddly robotic way of playing Master exibited, and eventually came to the conclusion it likely wasn't a typical Go player. Just days later, Demis Hassabis—the CEO of DeepMind, the Google-owned artificial intelligence company that created AlphaGO—came clean on Twitter with an update outing Master as AlphaGo. Related Stories Chinese AI Team Plans To Challenge Google’s AlphaGo Google’s AlphaGo Beats Go Champion Lee Sedol "Now that our unofficial testing is complete," Hassabis wrote, "we're looking forward to playing some official, full-length games later this year in collaboration with Go organizations and experts, to explore the profound mysteries of the game further in this spirit of mutual enlightenment." The Go community was generally positive in its response, as many players of the game wanted to have the opportunity to go up against the AI that has come to master the game they love. "How about a big thank you to DeepMind for granting our collective wish for the past 9 months," one user wrote. AlphaGo previously put together an impressive showing when faced against Lee Sedol, an 18-time world champion at the game of Go. The AI was able to win all but one of its games against the best human player the world had to offer, forcing Sedol to resign on four occasions in five total maches.

But over the past year a new arms race has emerged in Silicon Valley: competing to develop the most sophisticated virtual assistant. And Amazon is winning. The most convincing evidence of the Seattle-based giant’s advantage? Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant, is dominating this year’s CES. That’s the annual Las Vegas tech confab where gadget makers, auto manufacturers, and app developers gather to flaunt their latest and, they hope, greatest. Although Amazon didn’t officially attend the conference, Alexa showed up in car infotainment systems, new smartphones, robots, lamps, and even laundry machines. Ford, Whirlpool, Lenovo, GE, and Dish are a few of the brands announcing plans to add Amazon’s voice-activated helper to their hardware. That will make it possible to interact with those devices by saying something like, “Alexa, how much time is left on my wash cycle?” rather than sprinting downstairs to the laundry room. With Alexa, Amazon is building an invisible operating system for running a broad range of aspects of daily life. After years of promise—and considerable failure—voice-recognition technology has finally matured. “You don’t have to pull your phone out or have it relatively close by, that actually makes a difference,” says Alan Black, a professor at the Language Institute in Carnegie Mellon’ School of Computer Science. “Because it’s in the environment, it changes the way you interact with it. People will expect that it will just be there.” Much of Alexa’s coming ubiquity can be traced back the Amazon Echo, the $179.99 Internet-connected, Alexa-powered speaker that answers questions and runs apps. The Echo became a surprise hit with consumers — Amazon is estimated to have sold 5.1 million Echo devices since it launched the gadget in 2014, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. (Amazon does not reveal sales figures). Amazon also launched a smaller, more affordable Echo called the Echo Dot and a portable variant called the Amazon Tap last year. Other tech tech firms have taken notice. Google released late last year a similar device equipped with its own virtual aide called the Google Home, while Apple updated Siri to work with other apps and services in September. (Users can now, for example, say things like, “Siri, show me photos of bridesmaid dresses on Pinterest.”). Apple is also said to be working on its own Echo-like device, while Microsoft recently announced plans to brings its Cortana voice agent to Harman Kardon speakers. Samsung in late 2016 agreed to acquired Viv Labs, a startup founded by Siri’s original creator that is now developing an advanced personal assistant expected to debut on the next Galaxy smartphone. This trend will only continue: Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2019, 20 percent of all smartphone interactions will take place through personal assistants, and by 2020 most gadgets will be designed to work with “zero or minimal touch.” Amazon is contending with tech companies that have historically done better with consumers when it comes to gadgets and software. Apple is the second largest smartphone maker in the world, according to research firm IDC, while Google’s Android operating system powers 88% of smartphones across the globe, according to a report from Strategy Analytics. Amazon attempted to enter the smartphone arena in 2014 with the Fire Phone, but the device was shortly discontinued after poor reviews. (Amazon, of course, has been selling Kindle e-readers for nearly 10 years and Kindle Fire tablets since 2011.) Experts now believe Alexa gives Amazon an edge, as the Echo came to market earlier than Google Home and other rival devices. Another advantage: Amazon isn’t partial to any particular platform the way Google may be with Android or Apple with iOS, allowing Alexa to offer the same experience with little influence based on the other devices a user may own. “They’re Switzerland,” says Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “They cross all of these different ecosystems.” Technologies upon which virtual aides rely, like speech recognition and deep neural networks, have improved dramatically over the last several years. That has translated into big improvements in software like Alexa and Siri, according to Carnegie Mellon’s Black. But they still lack a thorough understanding of speech, which Black expects to be the next area of focus for companies like Amazon. “There’s almost no dialogue, no long term interaction,” he says. “That’s still an open question.” At the moment, it’s also a question nearly everybody in the technology industry is racing to answer.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 SEARCH Justice and Public Safety Attackers Can Make it Impossible to Dial 911 A new type of attack has emerged that can knock out 911 access, creating extremely serious repercussions for public safety. by Mordechai Guri, Yisroel Mirsky and Yuval Elovici, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev / January 5, 2017 0 Photo Courtesy of Shutterstock It’s not often that any one of us needs to dial 911, but we know how important it is for it to work when one needs it. It is critical that 911 services always be available – both for the practicality of responding to emergencies, and to give people peace of mind. But a new type of attack has emerged that can knock out 911 access – our research explains how these attacks occur as a result of the system’s vulnerablities. We show these attacks can create extremely serious repercussions for public safety. In recent years, people have become more aware of a type of cyberattack called “denial-of-service,” in which websites are flooded with traffic – often generated by many computers hijacked by a hacker and acting in concert with each other. This happens all the time, and has affected traffic to financial institutions, entertainment companies, government agencies and even key internet routing services. A similar attack is possible on 911 call centers. In October, what appears to be the first such attack launched from a smartphone happened in Arizona. An 18-year-old hacker was arrested on charges that he conducted a telephone denial-of-service attack on a local 911 service. If we are to prevent this from happening in more places, we need to understand how 911 systems work, and where the weaknesses lie, both in technology and policy. Understanding denial of service RELATEDRed Cross Apps Help Emergency Preparation, ResponseSmart911 to Speed Emergency Response in HonoluluEmergency Alerts Become Personalized Computer networks have capacity limits – they can handle only so much traffic, so many connections, at one time. If they get overloaded, new connections can’t get through. The same thing happens with phone lines – which are mostly computer network connections anyway. So if an attacker can manage to tie up all the available connections with malicious traffic, no legitimate information – like regular people browsing a website, or calling 911 in a real emergency – can make it through. This type of attack is most often done by spreading malware to a great many computers, infecting them so that they can be controlled remotely. Smartphones, which are after all just very small computers, can also be hijacked in this way. Then the attacker can tell them to inundate a particular site or phone number with traffic, effectively taking it offline. Many internet companies have taken significant steps to guard against this sort of attack online. For example, Google Shield is a service that protect news sites from attacks by using Google’s massive network of internet servers to filter out attacking traffic while allowing through only legitimate connections. Phone companies, however, have not taken similar action. Addressing the 911 telephone system Before 1968, American emergency services had local phone numbers. People had to dial specific numbers to reach the fire, police or ambulance services – or could dial “0” for the operator, who could connect them. But that was inconvenient, and dangerous – people couldn’t remember the right number, or didn’t know it because they were just visiting the area. The 911 system was created to serve as a more universal and effective system. As it has developed over the years, a 911 caller is connected with a specialized call center – called a public safety answering point – that is responsible for getting information from the caller and dispatching the appropriate emergency services. These call centers are located in communities across the country, and each provides service to specific geographic regions. Some serve individual cities, while others serve wider areas, such as counties. When telephone customers dial 911 on their landlines or mobile phones, the telephone companies’ systems make the connection to the appropriate call center. To better understand how denial-of-service attacks could affect 911 call systems, we created a detailed computer simulation of North Carolina’s 911 infrastructure, and a general simulation of the entire U.S. emergency-call system. Investigating the impact of an attack After we set up our simulation, we attacked it to find out how vulnerable it is. We found that it was possible to significantly reduce the availability of 911 service with only 6,000 infected mobile phones – just 0.0006 percent of the state’s population. Using only that relatively small number of phones, it is possbile to effectively block 911 calls from 20 percent of North Carolina landline callers, and half of mobile customers. In our simulation, even people who called back four or five times would not be able to reach a 911 operator to get help. Nationally, a similar percentage, representing just 200,000 hijacked smartphones, would have a similar effect. But this is, in a certain sense, an optimistic finding. Trey Forgety, the director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, responded to our findings in the Washington Post, saying, “We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated.” Policy makes the threat worse These sorts of attacks could, potentially, be made less effective if malicious calls were identified and blocked at the moment they were placed. Mobile phones have two different kinds of identifying information. The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is the phone number a person must call to reach that phone. The IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) is used to track the specific physical device on the network. A defense system could be set up to identify 911 calls coming from a particular phone that has made more than a certain number of 911 calls in a given period of time – say more than 10 calls in the last two minutes. This raises ethical problems – what if there is a real and ongoing emergency, and someone keeps losing phone reception while talking to a dispatcher? If they called back too many times, would their cries for help be blocked? In any case, attackers who take over many phones could circumvent this sort of defense by telling their hijacked phones to call less frequently – and by having more individual phones make the calls. But federal rules to ensure access to emergency services mean this issue might be moot anyway. A 1996 Federal Communications Commission order requires mobile phone companies to forward all 911 calls directly to emergency dispatchers. Cellphone companies are not allowed to check whether the phone the call is coming from has paid to have an active account in service. They cannot even check whether the phone has a SIM card in place. The FCC rule is simple: If anyone dials 911 on a mobile phone, they must be connected to an emergency call center. The rule makes sense from a public safety perspective: If someone is having (or witnessing) a life-threatening emergency, they shouldn’t be barred from seeking help just because they didn’t pay their cellphone bill, or don’t happen to have an active account. But the rule opens an vulnerability in the system, which attackers can exploit. A sophisticated attacker could infect a phone in a way that makes it dial 911 but report it does not have a SIM card. This “anonymized” phone reports no identity, no phone number and no information about who owns it. Neither the phone company nor the 911 call center could block this call without possibly blocking a legitimate call for help. The countermeasures that exist, or are possible, today are difficult and highly flawed. Many of them involve blocking certain devices from calling 911, which carries the risk of preventing a legitimate call for help. But they indicate areas where further inquiry – and collaboration between researchers, telecommunications companies, regulators and emergency personnel – could yield useful breakthroughs. For example, cellphones might be required to run a monitoring software to block themselves from making fraudulent 911 calls. Or 911 systems could examine identifying information of incoming calls and prioritize those made from phones that are not trying to mask themselves. We must find ways to safeguard the 911 system, which protects us all. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We had a moment to catch up with Sony Electronics president Michael Fasulo during CES 2017. Fasulo heads up the Sony’s home entertainment division that includes devices such as TVs and speakers, in addition to Sony’s camera business. Since Sony just debuted its first OLED TV at the show, the XBR-A1E Bravia 4K, we decided to focus on that, and some of Sony’s plans for 4K in the future. TB: I saw you have Google Home in your booth. Alexa is huge at the show. Does Sony have plans to develop its own smart home speaker? Fasulo: We’re already in that market. Not entering it. Our TVs are all Android. Taking the Android platform from the smart TV perspective, and now Google Home, you’ll be able to voice activate and control our televisions going forward. We’re also working with Amazon and Alexa or Echo but from a platform point of view, our standard right now is the Google platform, Android TV and Google Home. TB: This is your first OLED TV. Can you tell us a bit about it and perhaps why it’s better than what the competition offers? Fasulo: “We get questions why OLED? You’ve got LCD so now why OLED? We want to give consumers choice. At our highest level, we introduced the Z series last year. That still remains the flagship display. The very best display on the planet. Now this year, just below that, we have our new entry into OLED. We’ve taken our proprietary technology that we’ve included in our Bravia’s to date, all of those great engineering prowess are going to make the picture look better than others. The really interesting thing that’s the world’s first and groundbreaking is something called acoustic sound. It emanates through the screen. No speakers. It’s less than a half an inch thin. Right behind the screen, the audio is emanating through the screen via vibration. No distortion. The 55 and 65 will be available in the spring. The 77 inch will be available later in the summer maybe in the fall.” TB: Sony at least recently has waited to enter markets. Why is timing right now for OLED to enter the market? Fasulo: We’ve been manufacturing and involved in OLED manufacturing for years. On a professional side, we still have the reference model for studio companies. Up until now, it’s been very difficult to produce scale and quantity in larger sizes. But that’s becoming more efficient. It’s just a matter of timing, not about waiting and seeing, but getting it optimized so we can produce scale. TB: Last year you said 4K UHD is a growth catalyst. Our readers want to know why 4K Blu-Ray isn’t in the PS4 Pro. Is there a reason you’re waiting? Fasulo: Founded in choice. Streaming has insignificant momentum and growth. We want to support streaming. We want to support all mediums of entertainment. The Pro is doing great and we’ll be introducing our 4K UHD Blu-Ray player in the spring. So, a standalone Blu-Ray player. So consumers can get the best of both worlds. TB: One of our questions we had was about Sony’s foray into virtual reality and augmented reality. People are waiting to see what Sony is going to do with AR. Fasulo: That’s a great question I’m glad you asked that. I’m not sure how many people know the difference. Augmented reality is taking existing facts and data, images and content, and making it coming to life. Virtual reality is creating fresh. We launched our PlayStation VR this holiday. PlayStation had a phenomenal holiday. From the gaming point of view, we see VR expanding even beyond gaming. Right now the priority is gaming. There’s a lot of B-to-B opportunity in VR as well. From the augmented reality perspective, we currently not only have the capability but have done events we’re we’ve used augmented reality. I did an event last year around the All Star Game and there was a famous announcer that was being honored and through augmented reality, we had him come out of the poster and take pictures with people even though he wasn’t there. It’s something we’re really involved in and engaged in and over time you’ll see more. TB: We know this falls out of your scope. What’s Sony’s play in the mobile space. Is there a new course? To your point, it’s not under my responsibility, but we are working across companies to delivery a one-Sony effort. What you’ll see here is some mobile devices around the booth. We’re trying to introduce products that have merits of standing on their own. Whether that’s gaming, entertainment or whatever. We want to take the consumer pain points away. That’s why we partner with companies like Google for Google Home or Dolby Vision. Smart Assistants are important. Maybe not a single smart assistant, but multiple. We prefer the customer doesn’t have to repurchase everything they own. If we can send them an upgrade, connect devices together, especially with content, even if it’s using third party partnerships to do that. That’s what we’re trying to do. Bring entertainment to consumers, give them choice. TB: What’s next for PSVue? We know this isn’t your division, but curious how it plays into products you’re introducing here. Fasulo: I can tell you that it’s advancing very quickly. The consumer adoption of Vue is taking off. I see more and more of that momentum building. We went from test cities to a national footprint. And now it’s a resident app in our televisions That’s all! Check out the video of the interview at the top of this post.

It now has ten paying customers for its RecoverX distributed database backup product, six months after its June 2016 launch. We have discussed it here and here. The software uses semantic deduplication as part of its armory, and that's what we are going to look at here. RecoverX backs up non-relational databases running on-premises or in the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google and other clouds. V1.5 RecoverX supports Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Storage. It helps Google Cloud Platform users protect their next-generation apps hosted on non-relational databases (NoSQL, cloud, graph and more) deployed in IaaS and PaaS environments. The ten represent financial services, retail, eCommerce, media and entertainment, healthcare, and internet of things (IoT). Ayla Networks is the IoT customer and Datos IO backs up its AWS cloud infrastructure and non-relational databases. It bought RecoverX after finding script-based backup unsuitable because of costs and inability to scale. The retail customer is a Fortune 100 big-box home improvement retail business that migrated its existing e-commerce applications from on-premises data centers to public cloud with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), to meet compliance standards and enhance operational efficiency. Cassandra DBA Ishinder Singh's tweet asking if Datos IO had won Home Depot as a customer Another customer is Barracuda Networks. Datos IO says "RecoverX is founded upon Consistent Orchestrated Distributed Recovery (CODR), next-generation scale-out data protection architecture that is based on elastic compute services that can be auto-scaled with load, removes the dependency on media servers, and transfers data in parallel to and from file-based and object-based secondary storage. CODR allows RecoverX to provide scalable versioning so that enterprises can protect and back up their data at any interval and granularity. It enables one-click, orchestrated and repair-free recovery for both operational recovery and test/dev use cases, as well as industry-first semantic de-duplication that allows customers to save up to 70 percent on secondary storage costs." So what is semantic deduplication? A downloadable PDF from Datos IO's webpage is a research paper by several authors, including Datos IO cofounders CEO Tarun Thakur and CTO Prasenjit Sarkar. Its abstract discusses the backup and restore problem of next-generation eventually consistent storage systems (NECST – think non-relational databases like Cassandra and MongoDB) and suggests "a deep semantic understanding of the data stored within the system of interest as a solution." The paper describes how such "modern systems no longer store data on disks (or SSDs) within a single machine, but rather spread data across many machines in replicated fashion; the replication is implemented in an eventually consistent manner ... The core problem, as we outline, is simple: that tools and systems cannot readily obtain an efficient, consistent, and logical view of data beneath these complex, diverse, and distributed NECST systems." And then they say: We believe that the key to success centers upon a deep semantic understanding of the data being stored within these new storage systems. Only by monitoring and inspecting I/O traffic and reconstructing its meaning (i.e., whether a quorum has been reached, or exactly how a particular data item has been replicated) can critical NECST management functions be implemented in an efficient and scalable manner. Thus the first characteristic of semantic deduplication is that it is app-aware, with the app being the non-relational database. Attributes of the semantic understanding, or database operation structural understanding, include: Quorum reconciliation – Unlike traditional storage, where it is relatively easy to tell when an update has taken place, the simple task of knowing when an update has been committed to the storage system is challenging. NECST systems demand that tools and systems that are interested in what is stored within them understand the basics of how quorums are formed, and exactly how and when a data item is safely replicated within the system. By having a comprehensive understanding of the NECST replication protocol, a backup tool can determine the order of updates and form a coherent view of storage. Redundant-copy detection – Unlike traditional striped or mirrored systems, in which redundancy is easily observed, NECST systems may encode data copies in a non-bitwise-identical fashion. Thus, a NECST backup or archival system must be able to meticulously comb through the NECST system to determine where logically identical copies reside, so as to be able to coalesce them and thus achieve storage-efficient backup. Configuration-oblivious backup and restore – Distributed systems have frequent configuration changes, scaling up to meet new demands or down when a failure occurs and a system is removed from operation. NECST tools must be able to store, and then recreate, data despite the fact that its configuration has changed. Datos IO's CODR software "takes a full snapshot of the database of interest; after this, CODR tracks changes applied to the database and generates incremental versions for the changes." A version is "a cluster consistent snapshot of a scale-out distributed database." We're told: Full and incremental snapshots are transferred, in parallel, to a backup storage system, which can be a single node in smaller deployments, or a cluster in larger-scale settings. At the backup store, CODR must process the collection of local snapshots to realize a version. CODR achieves this end by running an integrated quorum and semantic-deduplication algorithm, resulting in a single, space-efficient copy of the data. This means that CODR must have algorithms inside it that are specific to individual database products and cannot simply be pointed at a new database product about which it has no semantic (operation structural) knowledge. CODR deployment schematic You can explore what Datos IO says about how CODR works here and there are several videos. RecoverX has an annual subscription license with the notion of a capacity tier based on physical database size ($/TB). Having gained just ten customers in six months suggests that the pricing is not cheap, and that customers may need to suffer a degree of pain from their current backup and recovery operations before switching to Datos IO. Why did we start this article by saying Datos IO is the Tesla of the backup industry? Assume Veeam, Veritas and Dell EMC are the Ford, GM and Chrysler of backup software. We think that Datos IO, like Tesla, is redefining how you do backup by going its own clever way, and focussing on a well-designed and high-end product to build its business. (No, stop thinking about cars catching fire or crashing.) We're sure it will expand its database coverage in the future and potentially collide with the Veeams and Veritas' in the market, which will make for interesting times in the backup industry. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 5 Comments More from The Register Fear of Staxit: What next for ASF's Cassandra as biggest donor cuts back Fill the DataStax-sized hole with big ideas Quantum: Well, would you look at that.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Jan 5, 2017 at 2:22PM Image source: Amazon. In CEO Jeff Bezos' annual letter to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders from April 2016, he highlighted the company's three pillars: Prime (its $99-a-year membership), Marketplace (where it sells items), and Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing business). All three have been instrumental to Amazon's success over the past decade-plus and Bezos wrote, "I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth [pillar]." It looks like that fourth pillar could be the Echo smart speaker featuring the Alexa digital assistant. It's been two years since Amazon unveiled the Echo, which can serve as a hub for other smart-home devices like thermostats and lightbulbs, and its functionality has been extended through third-party "skills," which function like voice-controlled apps. Amazon has the scale and infrastructure necessary to grow the Echo and Alexa into its fourth pillar. Voice computing is the future Nobody expects using voice-activated digital assistants will replace using smartphones or desktop computers, not even Bezos. However, there's clearly a growing trend toward using voice search and interacting with digital assistants. Google recently released a device similar to Echo, Google Home, in order to take advantage of the trend. Additionally, the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary said voice searches tripled over the last two years. As the artificial intelligence (AI) powering these devices improves, their usefulness increases. And as they're used more, the AI improves, creating a virtuous cycle. Another virtuous cycle for Amazon Amazon has a first-mover advantage in the smart speaker category, and its success with its Kindle line gives consumers confidence in its brand. But Amazon's biggest advantage with the Echo and Alexa is how it can integrate its existing Prime and Marketplace pillars into its Echo business. One of the primary ways Google is considering monetizing voice searches is through commerce. It recently released a development kit for retailers and service providers to create apps for Google Assistant -- the AI powering Google Home and found in several other Google apps -- to connect with potential customers. Eventually, Google plans to take a cut of sales made through these apps. But Amazon already has a direct line to customers and a huge marketplace of items -- one of its three pillars. Customers can order products using Alexa, and Amazon will use your order history to figure out what you want or choose an item based on user reviews and pricing. Of course, that feature is only available to Prime members -- urging more customers to sign up for the service. Non-members can still ask Alexa to add items to their cart for checkout later, but they'd have to finish ordering the old-fashioned way and using your fingers to buy stuff online is so 2014. As such, Alexa serves to support Amazon's Marketplace and Prime and vice versa. Similarly, Prime supports the  Marketplace business by increasing customer loyalty and attracting new third-party sellers to the platform. That, in turn, brings more Prime-eligible products to the Marketplace, increasing the value of Prime. Adding Alexa to the mix strengthens the other two pillars, making it another pillar. Amazon is really pushing Alexa Amazon is putting a lot of money behind marketing Alexa. It's been running a television and digital video ad campaign over the last year, including a Super Bowl commercial starring Alec Baldwin. Amazon produced over 100 10-second spots for the campaign based on real-life use cases of the voice assistant. Most recently, Amazon struck a deal with Wynn Hotels to put an Echo device in each of Wynn's 4,748 Las Vegas hotel rooms. The device will be able to control the lights, temperature, drapes, and TV, with potentially more features to come. It's a clever marketing ploy that will introduce thousands of people to the Echo and allow them to have a firsthand experience using it. Behind the scenes, Amazon has over 1,000 employees working on Alexa, according to Bezos. He also said the current functionality of Alexa is "just the tip of the iceberg." It's clear from its investments that Amazon sees the huge potential of Alexa. It's not just a stand-alone product, but a potential pillar of its business that supports its other operations -- specifically, Marketplace and Prime.

It is critical that 911 services always be available – both for the practicality of responding to emergencies, and to give people peace of mind. But a new type of attack has emerged that can knock out 911 access – our research explains how these attacks occur as a result of the system’s vulnerablities. We show these attacks can create extremely serious repercussions for public safety. In recent years, people have become more aware of a type of cyberattack called “denial-of-service,” in which websites are flooded with traffic – often generated by many computers hijacked by a hacker and acting in concert with each other. This happens all the time, and has affected traffic to financial institutions, entertainment companies, government agencies and even key internet routing services. A similar attack is possible on 911 call centers. In October, what appears to be the first such attack launched from a smartphone happened in Arizona. An 18-year-old hacker was arrested on charges that he conducted a telephone denial-of-service attack on a local 911 service. If we are to prevent this from happening in more places, we need to understand how 911 systems work, and where the weaknesses lie, both in technology and policy. Understanding denial of service Computer networks have capacity limits – they can handle only so much traffic, so many connections, at one time. If they get overloaded, new connections can’t get through. The same thing happens with phone lines – which are mostly computer network connections anyway. So if an attacker can manage to tie up all the available connections with malicious traffic, no legitimate information – like regular people browsing a website, or calling 911 in a real emergency – can make it through. This type of attack is most often done by spreading malware to a great many computers, infecting them so that they can be controlled remotely. Smartphones, which are after all just very small computers, can also be hijacked in this way. Then the attacker can tell them to inundate a particular site or phone number with traffic, effectively taking it offline. Many internet companies have taken significant steps to guard against this sort of attack online. For example, Google Shield is a service that protect news sites from attacks by using Google’s massive network of internet servers to filter out attacking traffic while allowing through only legitimate connections. Phone companies, however, have not taken similar action. Addressing the 911 telephone system Before 1968, American emergency services had local phone numbers. People had to dial specific numbers to reach the fire, police or ambulance services – or could dial “0” for the operator, who could connect them. But that was inconvenient, and dangerous – people couldn’t remember the right number, or didn’t know it because they were just visiting the area. The 911 system was created to serve as a more universal and effective system. As it has developed over the years, a 911 caller is connected with a specialized call center – called a public safety answering point – that is responsible for getting information from the caller and dispatching the appropriate emergency services. These call centers are located in communities across the country, and each provides service to specific geographic regions. Some serve individual cities, while others serve wider areas, such as counties. When telephone customers dial 911 on their landlines or mobile phones, the telephone companies’ systems make the connection to the appropriate call center. To better understand how denial-of-service attacks could affect 911 call systems, we created a detailed computer simulation of North Carolina’s 911 infrastructure, and a general simulation of the entire U.S. emergency-call system. Investigating the impact of an attack After we set up our simulation, we attacked it to find out how vulnerable it is. We found that it was possible to significantly reduce the availability of 911 service with only 6,000 infected mobile phones – just 0.0006 percent of the state’s population. Using only that relatively small number of phones, it is possbile to effectively block 911 calls from 20 percent of North Carolina landline callers, and half of mobile customers. In our simulation, even people who called back four or five times would not be able to reach a 911 operator to get help. Nationally, a similar percentage, representing just 200,000 hijacked smartphones, would have a similar effect. But this is, in a certain sense, an optimistic finding. Trey Forgety, the director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, responded to our findings in the Washington Post, saying, “We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated.” Policy makes the threat worse These sorts of attacks could, potentially, be made less effective if malicious calls were identified and blocked at the moment they were placed. Mobile phones have two different kinds of identifying information. The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is the phone number a person must call to reach that phone. The IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) is used to track the specific physical device on the network. A defense system could be set up to identify 911 calls coming from a particular phone that has made more than a certain number of 911 calls in a given period of time – say more than 10 calls in the last two minutes. This raises ethical problems – what if there is a real and ongoing emergency, and someone keeps losing phone reception while talking to a dispatcher? If they called back too many times, would their cries for help be blocked? In any case, attackers who take over many phones could circumvent this sort of defense by telling their hijacked phones to call less frequently – and by having more individual phones make the calls. But federal rules to ensure access to emergency services mean this issue might be moot anyway. A 1996 Federal Communications Commission order requires mobile phone companies to forward all 911 calls directly to emergency dispatchers. Cellphone companies are not allowed to check whether the phone the call is coming from has paid to have an active account in service. They cannot even check whether the phone has a SIM card in place. The FCC rule is simple: If anyone dials 911 on a mobile phone, they must be connected to an emergency call center. The rule makes sense from a public safety perspective: If someone is having (or witnessing) a life-threatening emergency, they shouldn’t be barred from seeking help just because they didn’t pay their cellphone bill, or don’t happen to have an active account. But the rule opens an vulnerability in the system, which attackers can exploit. A sophisticated attacker could infect a phone in a way that makes it dial 911 but report it does not have a SIM card. This “anonymized” phone reports no identity, no phone number and no information about who owns it. Neither the phone company nor the 911 call center could block this call without possibly blocking a legitimate call for help. The countermeasures that exist, or are possible, today are difficult and highly flawed. Many of them involve blocking certain devices from calling 911, which carries the risk of preventing a legitimate call for help. But they indicate areas where further inquiry – and collaboration between researchers, telecommunications companies, regulators and emergency personnel – could yield useful breakthroughs. For example, cellphones might be required to run a monitoring software to block themselves from making fraudulent 911 calls. Or 911 systems could examine identifying information of incoming calls and prioritize those made from phones that are not trying to mask themselves. We must find ways to safeguard the 911 system, which protects us all. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

It was very motivating for us to see that in the narrow lanes of Dharavi — otherwise a replica of what you see in the movies — people were so technologically advanced.” This gave him the validation he was seeking for his project. Mr. Parab has developed a ‘physical web’ to help Dharavi’s entrepreneurs promote their business. The project, in collaboration with Swansea University in the UK, is part of Google’s Internet of Things Technology Research Award. The award was announced in February 2016. Prof. Matt Jones of Swansea University and Prof. Anirudha Joshi of IDC had applied for it, and the project was selected for a pilot in May. Once the experiments have been conducted, team members will submit their feedback and report, following which Google is expected to extend in-kind support to the successful projects. The core of the project is a small device made by Google, called a ‘beacon’, 100 of which have been provided for the pilot. The beacon is a Bluetooth 4.0 device, that is mounted on a wall. It broadcasts a given web URL to anyone with a Bluetooth device within a range of 20 to 30 feet. How does it all work? Posters fixed on shop windows ask customers to turn on Bluetooth, location and internet data, and the physical web / nearby settings in the Chrome browser. When a customer is in the proximity of any such beacon-enabled shop, she will get a notification in her smart phone via Bluetooth. Within rage of the beacon, she gets a link to the website, where she can browse through the products available through an interactive interface, a custom-made app made at IIT-B. This tool, Mr. Parab says, is designed keeping in mind those who use basic apps like Facebook and WhatsApp. Prof. Joshi says the beacons can be programmed once and last for two to three years. A small experiment The idea for the project, Mr. Parab says, began when “we said to ourselves that trends in technology are generally accessible to people in Western countries or those who can afford them in India.” By 2020, it has been predicted that there will be 20 billion small devices all over the world. “Why can’t you give this access to people who have never use anything in their lives, and how can they use it to promote their business? How can we enable people to use the latest technology?” The goal, partly, is to change perceptions: “The image of Dharavi is that it is dirty, and full of poor people. Movies like Slumdog Millionaire have had a huge role to play in this. But there’s a self-sustaining economy here; the estimated turnover in 2015 was $1 billion. A lot of businesses are not registered so there are no actual numbers.” Prof. Joshi adds, “This is a small experiment to see if we can use technology to build perceptions about a place. Dharavi is not just about slums. It has a lot of businesses, and we wanted to bring this aspect out.” They wanted to see what kind of business opportunities this would enable for the entrepreneurs, on one side, and for customers, they wanted examine how perceptions can be changed by using ‘later-than-the-latest’ technology, not deployed anywhere in India or even in the world. The installations, which began on Christmas Day, are taking more time than Mr. Parab anticipated; he should have had 30 devices up and running by now, but he’s managed only 11 so far. “We found external factors influencing its adoption: people were more worried about demonetisation. Some thought I was just another person making a pitch, and didn’t even listen. I had to explain what it will do and how it will benefit business and marketing.” Also, businesses in the area are traditional — passed on from generation to generation — and have regular customers, so the owners see no point in marketing. Only a few of them, those who had been exposed to e-commerce sites like Amazon and Snapdeal, were receptive. For Mr. Parab, the best part of the project so far has been, in his words: “You put technology inside a black box which acts like magic for these people. We don’t tell them how the technology works; we just show them the front-end or the utility of it. Research has shown that people don’t adopt technology unless they find it useful.” A walk through the leather goods market indicate that, overall, business is down. Though the streets outside buzz with traffic and pedestrians, the shop salesmen sit around waiting for customers, or stand near their shop windows, looking out longingly. Very few shop-owners had any idea about the project, this reporter found no signboards indicating its use either. Sahil Ansari, owner of Leather Corner, isn’t sure the device will draw customers just yet. “A lot of people discover Dharavi’s markets on YouTube. I’ve had customers come to my store and tell me they saw it there.” He says IIT asked him to try it out for about a month, and he allowed them to install it. The device sits smugly on the window sill of his mezzanine storehouse. The drawbacks, he says, are that it depends on passers-by having their Bluetooth turned on all the time, which most people don’t, since it is a drain on battery, and that it requires people to make changes in their Google settings. “But I can gradually upload up to 10 photos of my product using this method.” ‘A part of their lives’ Mr. Parab is confident that perceptions and knowledge will change, as it’s been only a few days since the devices were turned on. Asked if the various steps involved were not a deterrent, Prof. Joshi said there would be a certain interest to try out a new technology in the beginning, and gradually, it would become part of their lives. “We don’t know how successful it will be. We’re trying it out for the first time in Dharavi. We might get a clearer picture in a few months from now.” Academically, the project will be over in a few months, but the devices will remain with the users. In the first phase of Mr. Parab’s plan, he is installing beacons in 30 of the nearly 200 shops in Dharavi’s leather markets. In phase two and three, he hopes to connect Kumbharwada, the potters’ colony, and the garment traders in the area as well. “Our expectation is that we can put up 1,000 beacons all over Dharavi,” he says. At the moment, he is preparing for a jury over the weekend, that will evaluate the project. Whether the project does get the green light to expand or not, he has already learned something of value, he says. “The project taught me how to live my life and not complain about petty things. This may sound philosophical, but people here survive without worrying about tomorrow, and I learnt that from them.” More In Mumbai Related Articles << Previous Story With fog, fewer flights in this fight Next Story >> HC asks Anna Hazare to take up ‘sugar scam’ with the police Please Wait while comments are loading...

That includes integrations with more new services, such as popular radio streaming service iHeartRadio, which has announced that it will be coming to Google Home. Unfortunately, this support is not live just yet, nor will it be for a little while, but the integration is coming soon according to the press release. When support does go live, you’ll be able to link your iHeartRadio account just as you would a Spotify or Pandora account in the Google Home app, then ask Home to play music from specific stations or artists. It’s unclear exactly how this will work, but from how it’s described in the press release, it sounds a lot like how Spotify works on the Home. Along with Google Home, iHeartRadio is also coming to Samsung’s Family Hub, the Gear S3 smartwatch, as well as DISH Music and Speak Music Melody. iHeartMedia Announces New iHeartRadio Consumer Electronic Integrations at CES 2017 Integrations with Google, Samsung and others bring the iHeartRadio experience to even more consumers January 05, 2017 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time LAS VEGAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–iHeartMedia, creator of iHeartRadio – the all-in-one streaming music and live digital radio service — today announced five new integrations at the Consumer Electronics Show. These integrations will provide iHeartRadio’s more than 95 million registered users with new ways to access iHeartRadio’s vast collection of live radio, custom Artist Radio stations, podcasts and more. iHeartRadio will be integrated with devices across in-home connectivity, wearable technology and mobile applications including: Google Home: Listen to iHeartRadio on Google Home, the voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant. Coming soon to Google Home, playing iHeartRadio will be as easy as saying “Ok Google” followed by your favorite radio station or artist, giving users access to thousands of iHeartRadio’s live radio stations and millions of songs, with podcast functionality coming soon. Samsung Family Hub: A new integration with Samsung Family Hub will allow users to listen to iHeartRadio stations right from their refrigerator. Samsung Family Hub features a touch-enabled screen that resides on the door of a Samsung refrigerator, creating a focal point for families to share notes and photos, coordinate calendars, and now – listen to their favorite music via iHeartRadio. Through this integration, families can enjoy live radio stations, personalized custom Artist Radio stations, and other great iHeartRadio content through the iHeartRadio application. You can check out a demo on the CES show floor, Central Hall, booth 15006. Samsung Gear S3: With the Gear S3, the smartwatch that’s engineered for adventure, iHeartRadio users can control their music listening experience right from their wrist. This integration with Samsung gives Gear 3 users free access to thousands of live radio stations, custom Artist Radio stations and podcasts, on top of all of the core features of the Android iHeartRadio app. DISH Music: Recently launched by DISH, DISH Music is a new mobile app powered by DTS Play-Fi that provides a complete, room-to-room music entertainment experience by enabling users to stream music on TV audio systems throughout the home and control this content via their Android or iOS smartphones and tablets. Through an integration with iHeartRadio, DISH Music users can now enjoy thousands of live and custom Artist Radio stations, as well as podcasts from iHeartRadio, syncing the same music across rooms, or playing different stations throughout the home. DISH Music will be available on all Hopper 2 and Hopper 3 DVRs. You can see a demo on the CES show floor, Central Hall, booth 11421. Speak Music Melody: iHeartRadio and Speak Music have teamed to launch Melody, a hands-free listening experience. Melody is Speak Music’s new voice-enabled platform that gives users the ultimate hands-free listening experience via a free iOS app — a personal music assistant with access to millions of songs and thousands of radio stations. Melody is the perfect solution for the music lovers on the go who can now connect with a vast selection of audio and musical content while multitasking, driving and working out, all with the convenience of simple voice commands. Through this integration, Melody users will be able to listen to iHeartRadio’s live and custom Artist Radio stations through the Melody app or via connected Bluetooth enabled iHome devices. “We are always committed to making iHeartRadio available on the devices and platforms that our listeners want and expect us to be on,” said Darren Davis, President of iHeartRadio. “These new integrations allow our users to access the music and personalities they love most across even more apps, wearables and connected home devices they use every day.” CES delegates can also experience two auto concept integrations; Alexa Voice Services within Ford Sync (Ford booth 5002, North Hall) where drivers will be able to use their voice to play their favorite iHeartRadio live and custom Artist Radio stations in the car; and a Qualcomm integration (booth 5609, North Hall) that puts delegates inside a Maserati to experience seamless listening transition from AM/FM radio to streaming radio with the iHeartRadio app when the car drives out of tower range. Today, iHeartRadio also announced that it officially released its two new on demand services, iHeartRadio Plus and iHeartRadio All Access powered by Napster, the first fully differentiated streaming music services that use on demand functionality to make radio truly interactive. The two new services are available on iOS and Android with iHeartRadio All Access powered by Napster now available on desktop and select consumer electronic devices. Aside from the two new subscription on demand services, iHeartRadio will remain free. iHeartRadio offers users thousands of live radio stations, personalized custom Artist Radio stations created by just one song or seed artist and the top podcasts and personalities.

Some estimates put sales of the cloud-powered speaker at just over 5 million since its launch two years ago. Echo sales spiked 400 percent in December versus last year. And a growing number of Amazon customers place orders via Echo devices. But soon, it’ll have competition. On Tuesday, LG took the wraps off the Lenovo Smart Assistant, a cylindrical speaker that doubles as a voice-activated, Amazon-powered assistant. Smart Assistant Despite the Echo’s increasing important to Amazon’s retail operation, the Seattle-based firm has shown a willingness to pursue hardware agnosticism — likely in the interest of gathering usage stats and data. Smartwatches from CoWatch and Martian tap Alexa Voice Services, the natural language processing program that powers the Echo. So does Omate’s home robot, the Yumi, and Nucleus’s home intercom. The Lenovo Smart Assistant fits this category, relying on Alexa to conduct web searches, play music, provide calendar updates, create lists, and more. More: Windows Insider members get a sneak peek at the Creators Update with Office Hub “Our goal has never been to simply build smart home devices for the sake of advancing technology alone,” Johnson Jia, senior vice president of Lenovo’s PC & Smart Device Business Group, said in a statement. “In the same way a person’s IQ is measured by applied knowledge, we believe products are ‘smart’ to the degree they’re actually understood and applied to daily life by their users.” Though the Smart Assistant shares a likeness with Amazon’s Echo, it improves upon its forebear in a number of key ways. It boasts eight 360-degree far-field microphones, one more than the Echo’s seven. They’re capable of suppressing noise and canceling echos, and can pick up voice commands from up to 16 feet away. And the Smart Assistant sounds better, too. It sports a 5W treble speaker and 10W woofer. And it will launch alongside a special Harman Kardon edition that packs a 2-inch sound cavity for a “clearer tweeter” and “deeper bass.” More: Alexa is about to get a lot smarter thanks to hundreds of new commands The Lenovo Smart Assistant starts at $130, and the Harman Kardon Edition at $180. Both will be available in light gray, green, and orange when they begin shipping in May. The Smart Assistant might be perceived as another joint effort in Amazon’s effort to beat back Alexa’s competitors. Google unveiled its answer to the Echo, the Google Home, in November. The diminutive, rounded speaker, powered by server-side artificial intelligence called the Assistant, controls smart home appliances, plays music from streaming services like Spotify and Google’s own Play Music, and answers questions using Google’s Knowledge Graph search tool. More: Home Hub, Microsoft’s answer to Alexa and Google Home, could be PC-driven Google is not the only one. Microsoft recently opened its Cortana voice services to third-party hardware and app developers. One of the first, audio company Harman Kardon, will launch a Cortana-powered speaker in 2017. Amazon, to its credit, hasn’t been resting on its laurels. It launched exclusive product sales and a $4-per-month streaming music service exclusively for Echo owners earlier this year, and Alexa’s app ecosystem has exploded in recent months. Developers have built more than 3,000 skills, or apps, since Amazon opened the platform to third parties last year. A GE Appliances skill preheats connected ovens with a voice command. Uber and Lyft skills summon cars. An AT&T app records and sends text messages. And myriad home automation skills switch off lights, open garage doors, and unlock doors. And even more capabilities are on the way. Earlier this year, Amazon started a $100 million fund to jump-start services that rely on Alexa’s cloud-powered voice interpretation. So far, 18 startups have received funding. Smart Storage Lenovo also took the opportunity to debut Smart Storage, a network-attached 6TB hard drive with dual-band wireless capabilities and autosync features. It’s optimized for security and peer-to-peer media sharing, Lenovo says, and packs integrated facial recognition software that organizes photo libraries automatically The Lenovo Smart Storage unit starts at $130, and will be available in light gray, green, and orange, beginning in May 2017. Both Smart Assistant and Smart Storage are a part of Lenovo’s plan to crack home automation. The Internet of Things market is expected to reach $1.7 trillion in 2020, the company points out, and may create up to $11.1 trillion per year in potential economic impact. More: With help from Cortana, Microsoft aims to make your home even smarter “[These products] are just the beginning,” Lenovo wrote in a press release. “We’ll continue to work collaboratively with customers to imagine, design and build home products that they want, can afford, and will use — with the vision to fundamentally improve every aspect of their home life.” Share

Stephen Lam/Getty Images People don’t hate advertisements, what they hate is being watched. Okay, people aren’t nuts about ads themselves, either, but the real hostility to internet advertising is that they track users so aggressively. That tracking invades privacy and costs users money and time. Ad networks also stymie publishers from switching to HTTPS, a more secure way to serve web pages to users. Most people who object to tracking use ad blockers, like Ghostery or AdBlock. Firefox, in fact, has tracker blocking built in. Some web users aren’t satisfied with just shutting trackers down, however. They want to take it a step further and corrupt the trackers’ data. Enter AdNauseam, a browser extension that’s still available on Firefox and Opera. Created by Dr. Helen Nissenbaum, Mushon Zer-Aviv and Daniel Howe, it hides in the background clicking on every single ad while the user browses the web. It is meant to protest against tracking rather than protecting privacy. Browser extensions ad new functionality from the web. They have to be intentionally added by a user from that browsers’ store. With extensions, users can hide objectionable content with photos of kittens. Extensions might also, however, also serve really terrible spyware. When web users install AdNauseam, it serves as a functional piece of art in code, collectively expressing a pro-privacy sentiment shared by its makers and users. The Observer spoke to Howe after he unveiled AdNauseam 2.0. Version 3.0 came out in November. On January 1, users of the extension began contacting the AdNauseam team saying that it had been banned from the Chrome store. Today, the AdNauseam team posted the following statement: We wrote Google to ask the reason for this sudden move and they responded that AdNauseam had breached the Web Store’s terms of service, stating that “An extension should have a single purpose that is clear to users…”, but providing no detail as to what the multiple purposes might be. To be clear, AdNauseam has a single purpose which we believe to be readily apparent to users; namely to fight back against the mass surveillance conducted by advertising networks, of which Google is a prime example. It continued: It is frightening to think that at any moment Google can quietly make your extensions and data disappear, without so much as a warning. Today it is your privacy tool, tomorrow it is your photo album or password manager. Wikipedia has collected various sources with estimates of the total market share of different browsers. Estimates generally place Chrome at 50 percent of the market or higher. AdNauseam takes credit for many thousands of people using its extension in its statement. That’s impressive, but far short of the many hundreds of millions of people Google reaches. Mountain View might simply have a zero tolerance policy for anyone trifling with its business model or tracker data is easier to corrupt than activists suspected. Twitter users are slowly building up a rallying cry for the service: Looks like Google took down Ad Nauseam. Hope it was a mistake and that it will be restored asap. https://t.co/CIkUvHVN0i #FreeADNAUSEAM — Job Plas (@JobPlas) January 5, 2017 TIL Google is not evil unless there's money to be made in which case they happily are #freeadnauseamhttps://t.co/RfeE2juFW0 — Maximilien Riehl (@MaximilienRiehl) January 5, 2017 Adnauseam removed from chrome web store for fight against mass surveillance of advertising networks https://t.co/j8nHkXsFGm #FreeADNAUSEAM — John Brett 🇮🇪 (@johnbrett_) January 5, 2017 Google was not immediately available for comment. In its post, AdNauseam reported that after contacting the Chrome Store team, it was told that AdNauseam violated its terms of service by not having a “single purpose that is clear to users.” While the team behind the completely open source project believed its users really did know the extension’s purpose, it has resubmitted its extension with language it believes should be even more explicit. Technical users that want to use Chrome with AdNauseam can still do so via this workaround on Github, though it requires using Chrome in developer mode. For users that used the data the extension collected about the ads it clicked, this workaround permits access to that information once again. We will update this story as we learn more.

 Samsung and Google teamed up to make two new Chromebooks that run Android apps Jeff Dunn Jan. 4, 2017, 5:00 PM 7,203 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Samsung Chromebook Plus. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Google is ready to push Android’s presence on Chromebooks — and Samsung is making some new hardware to help. Samsung on Wednesday announced a new pair of Chrome OS machines, the Chromebook Plus and the Chromebook Pro, which Google says were designed to better accommodate Android apps from the Google Play store. What that means is they’re both convertibles, or “2-in-1s,” so their displays can flip around 360 degrees and become a sort of makeshift Android hybrid tablet. They’re also the first Chromebooks to come with the Play store pre-installed — Google has slowly rolled out Play store support to a small selection of existing Chromebooks over the past few months — and the first to come with native support for a built-in stylus.  On the spec sheet, both machines seem fairly high-end. They each have 12.3-inch displays with taller, 3:2 aspect ratios — so they can fit a little bit more of a webpage on screen — and sharp 2400 x 1600 resolutions. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Both are nicely slim and light, measuring about a half-inch thick and just under 2.4 pounds, so it's not the most unwieldy thing in tablet mode. There’s two USB-C (but not Thunderbolt 3) ports and a microSD card slot on both, as well as an accelerometer and gyrometer, which should help the devices stay compatible with certain Android apps. Samsung rates each battery at about eight hours.  The main difference comes down to processing power. Both laptops feature 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, which is plenty for a Chromebook, but the Plus runs on an unspecified ARM chip that’s generally meant for mobile devices (likely from Rockchip) while the Pro is powered by a last-gen Intel Core m3 chip, which is mediocre for a Windows laptop, but should be more than enough to handle Chrome OS. Only the Chromebook Plus model has a set price and release frame: Samsung says it’ll cost $449 and arrive sometime in February. The Chromebook Pro is pegged to release “later this Spring,” but past leaks suggest it’ll cost $499. The included stylus, which slides into a slot on the Chromebook's side. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn For Chromebooks, these two are pretty expensive. And based on some brief hands-on time with the Chromebook Plus model, I have reasons to doubt they'll be worth the money. Google told me the software on my demo unit wasn’t finalized, so I can’t knock it for being sluggish, but the hardware itself didn’t feel as substantial as other pricey options like the Dell Chromebook 13 or HP Chromebook 13. The metal material isn't as chilly or sturdy. It certainly looks sharp, but the keyboard is on the shallow side, and the trackpad wasn’t anything special. The built-in stylus, while small, did seem to work in harmony with apps like Google Keep, but the screen wobbled noticeably whenever I wrote with it in laptop mode. On the plus side, the display looked great, and flipping the notebook into a tablet or tent mode was painless. Either way, we’ll have to test further before making a recommendation. The interesting bit here is in the software, as Google tries to overcome the quirks of having Android apps invade another OS. Unfortunately, the Chromebook Plus will only come with the beta version of the Play Store at launch. We’ve tried that before, and while it has some benefits (offline Netflix!), there's still some fundamental awkwardness, like not being able to granularly adjust window size, or certain apps not being formatted for larger screens. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Google laid the groundwork for addressing some of those issues in the latest Android 7.0 Nougat update, but right now the Play Store you'll find on the Chromebook Plus is running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with an update to come in a “few months.” Samsung’s new Chromebooks are not the first convertible laptops to work with Android apps, and time will tell if they’re worth buying, but more significant is how they may mark the start of Google finally getting the Android-Chrome OS combo going after months of delays. Kan Liu, Google’s senior director of product management, says that more “larger screen, productivity-focused, Android-type devices” will be announced by various companies before the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona next month. That would suggest that having Android apps play nicer outside of a mobile display could become more of a focal point. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Looming over all this is Andromeda, Google's long-rumored OS that will reportedly blend Android and Chrome OS together completely. Liu couldn’t comment on that directly, but did say that Google’s general goal is eventually to get a point where people "don’t care" about what the underlying OS is on their devices. “Over time, if [Chrome OS and Android] happen to get closer and closer together — such that, from a development perspective, it’s less work to duplicate work — we’re happy to have that as well,” he said. For now, though, Samsung thinks what merger is there can be a selling point. We’ll let you know if they’re right once the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro are available.

Written by Priyanka Sahoo | Mumbai | Published:January 6, 2017 12:52 am The stores are connected to the web through ‘beacons’, a technology officially to be launched by 2019, given by Google. Some leather shops in Dharavi have found a novel mode of marketing, thanks to a project by the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B). The shops can send notifications promoting their products to passers-by along the leather market, between Sion station and the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). Around 11 of the 150 leather shops have joined the ‘physical web’ created by an IIT team and another 19 are in the pipeline. Physical Web is a pilot project chosen by Google for the Internet of Things Technology Research Award. Watch What Else Is making News The stores are connected to the web through ‘beacons’, a technology officially to be launched by 2019, given by Google. The Industrial Design Centre (IDC) of the IIT has placed the beacons in the shops. While currently the beacons send signals up to a distance of 30 feet, they are capable of sending signals up to 60 feet. Any smartphone user can switch on bluetooth and location in the device to receive notifications from the shops and browse through the products sold inside. No external application is required to browse. Chinmay Parab, a second year M. Des student from the Interaction Design wing of IDC, said the aim of the project was to see how people react to a new technology. “We also aim to bridge the barrier between availability of technology and those who don’t have access to it,” said Parab. The other aim is to turn Dharavi into a digital hub. According to Parab, the team zeroed in on Dharavi after studying the people — termed emergent users — for over a year. “We study the recent users of technology. We noted a new pattern in the area with respect to technology adaptation and adoption. The small-scale manufacturers and business owners were adaptive to technology,” he said. The self-sustained informal economy of the area made it ideal for the pilot project. Currently the team is studying the reaction of the market to the physical web. “Every technology is created for a specific target, which should be able to afford the technology.” “We are trying iteration of the technology and observing whether this needs people to adapt themselves to it or whether people can simply adopt the technology,” said Parab. A report will be shared with Google, too, and the team is hopeful of a follow-up grant. The project is a collaborative effort of the IDC and Swansea University, UK. priyanka.sahoo@expressindia.com Best of Express Meghalaya sex scam: Guest-house owned by Home Minister’s family under probe EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentSalman Khan shares nostalgic picture from sets of Karan Arjun, wishes SRK-Hrithik for Raees-Kaabil EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party Must Read SportsKohli, Kedar hit magical tons to script sensational win SportsThis win is going to take a while to sink in, says Kohli SportsVirat Kohli leaves Twitterati awe-struck after century TechnologyNokia could be developing a foldable smartphone, hints patent TechnologyLenovo sends out press invite for MWC 2017, may debut Moto G5 Plus TechnologyFormer Android chief Andy Rubin to release a high-end, AI-focused smartphone  Sonam Kapoor, Frieda Pinto, Pooja Hegde: Best and worst dressed Bollywood divas at Filmfare Awards 2017 Jan 16: Latest News Centre issues draft requirements under digital village initiative Startup India: 2016 not a good year as new startups decline by 67% China finally agrees to import buffalo meat from India Kathputli Colony: Life at the transit camp C N Rao at Jamia Hamdard Convocation: ‘To excel in science, we need hard work, funds for varsities’ Priyanka SahooAuthor at The Indian Express... read more Startup India: 2016 not a good year as new startups decline by 67% Soon, new Mumbai University portal for college affiliation, teacher recruitment Complacency could hurt Indo-US partnership, says US Assistant Secretary to South and Central Asia                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Primary sources. Global perspective. advertisement Labor Department sues Google over fair compensation audit Thursday 5 January 2017 at 1:21 PM ET by Erik Slobe ©  WikiMedia (Ed Brown) [JURIST] The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) [official website], which is under the US Department of Labor, filed a lawsuit [complaint, PDF] Wednesday against Google [corporate website] over the company's refusal to provide requested items related to their compensation policies. Google is under an Advertising and Integrated Marketing Solutions contract with the federal government. Part of that contract includes an equal employment opportunity clause. On September 30, 2015, Google was selected through a neutral selection process to undergo a compliance evaluation. On June 1, 2016, the OFCCP requested a compensation snapshot of September 2014 names, contact information, and job and salary history for employees in the September 2014 snapshot and the September 2015 snapshot. The September 2015 snapshot was previously given by Google. On June 17, 2016, Google notified OFCCP that they would not provide these requested items. OFCCP is requesting that the court require Google to supply the requested items and allow them to complete their compliance review. In the event that Google does not provide the requested items, OFCCP is requesting the cancellation of all federal government contracts with Google and disallowing Google from being awarded any future government contracts until it shows OFCCP that Google complies with the equal opportunity provisions. OFCCP also is requesting "any other relief as justice may require." Google has stated [USA Today report] that the requested data includes thousands of employees' private contact information that Google safeguards. Google has been the subject of several lawsuits in recent years. In November Google was accused [JURIST report] by the EU of abuses in market dominance related to their Android mobile phone operating system. In January 2015 a representative for Google signed an agreement [JURIST report] to rewrite the company's current privacy policy in response to pressure from the UK Information Commissioner's Office [official website]. The same month Google was among four tech companies that reached a $415 million settlement [JURIST report] in a class action lawsuit claiming the companies unlawfully agreed to reduce employee compensation and mobility.

May 18, 2016 How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds — from a Magician and Google’s Design Ethicist Estimated reading time: 12 minutes. “It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they’ve been fooled.” — Unknown. I’m an expert on how technology hijacks our psychological vulnerabilities. That’s why I spent the last three years as a Design Ethicist at Google caring about how to design things in a way that defends a billion people’s minds from getting hijacked. When using technology, we often focus optimistically on all the things it does for us. But I want to show you where it might do the opposite. Where does technology exploit our minds’ weaknesses? I learned to think this way when I was a magician. Magicians start by looking for blind spots, edges, vulnerabilities and limits of people’s perception, so they can influence what people do without them even realizing it. Once you know how to push people’s buttons, you can play them like a piano. That’s me performing sleight of hand magic at my mother’s birthday party And this is exactly what product designers do to your mind. They play your psychological vulnerabilities (consciously and unconsciously) against you in the race to grab your attention. I want to show you how they do it. Hijack #1: If You Control the Menu, You Control the Choices Western Culture is built around ideals of individual choice and freedom. Millions of us fiercely defend our right to make “free” choices, while we ignore how those choices are manipulated upstream by menus we didn’t choose in the first place. This is exactly what magicians do. They give people the illusion of free choice while architecting the menu so that they win, no matter what you choose. I can’t emphasize enough how deep this insight is. When people are given a menu of choices, they rarely ask: “what’s not on the menu?” “why am I being given these options and not others?” “do I know the menu provider’s goals?” “is this menu empowering for my original need, or are the choices actually a distraction?” (e.g. an overwhelmingly array of toothpastes) How empowering is this menu of choices for the need, “I ran out of toothpaste”? For example, imagine you’re out with friends on a Tuesday night and want to keep the conversation going. You open Yelp to find nearby recommendations and see a list of bars. The group turns into a huddle of faces staring down at their phones comparing bars. They scrutinize the photos of each, comparing cocktail drinks. Is this menu still relevant to the original desire of the group? It’s not that bars aren’t a good choice, it’s that Yelp substituted the group’s original question (“where can we go to keep talking?”) with a different question (“what’s a bar with good photos of cocktails?”) all by shaping the menu. Moreover, the group falls for the illusion that Yelp’s menu represents a complete set of choices for where to go. While looking down at their phones, they don’t see the park across the street with a band playing live music. They miss the pop-up gallery on the other side of the street serving crepes and coffee. Neither of those show up on Yelp’s menu. Yelp subtly reframes the group’s need “where can we go to keep talking?” in terms of photos of cocktails served. The more choices technology gives us in nearly every domain of our lives (information, events, places to go, friends, dating, jobs) — the more we assume that our phone is always the most empowering and useful menu to pick from. Is it? The “most empowering” menu is different than the menu that has the most choices. But when we blindly surrender to the menus we’re given, it’s easy to lose track of the difference: “Who’s free tonight to hang out?” becomes a menu of most recent people who texted us (who we could ping). “What’s happening in the world?” becomes a menu of news feed stories. “Who’s single to go on a date?” becomes a menu of faces to swipe on Tinder (instead of local events with friends, or urban adventures nearby). “I have to respond to this email.” becomes a menu of keys to type a response (instead of empowering ways to communicate with a person). All user interfaces are menus. What if your email client gave you empowering choices of ways to respond, instead of “what message do you want to type back?” (Design by Tristan Harris) When we wake up in the morning and turn our phone over to see a list of notifications — it frames the experience of “waking up in the morning” around a menu of “all the things I’ve missed since yesterday.” (for more examples, see Joe Edelman’s Empowering Design talk) A list of notifications when we wake up in the morning — how empowering is this menu of choices when we wake up? Does it reflect what we care about? (from Joe Edelman’s Empowering Design Talk) By shaping the menus we pick from, technology hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them with new ones. But the closer we pay attention to the options we’re given, the more we’ll notice when they don’t actually align with our true needs. Hijack #2: Put a Slot Machine In a Billion Pockets If you’re an app, how do you keep people hooked? Turn yourself into a slot machine. The average person checks their phone 150 times a day. Why do we do this? Are we making 150 conscious choices? How often do you check your email per day? One major reason why is the #1 psychological ingredient in slot machines: intermittent variable rewards. If you want to maximize addictiveness, all tech designers need to do is link a user’s action (like pulling a lever) with a variable reward. You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward is most variable. Does this effect really work on people? Yes. Slot machines make more money in the United States than baseball, movies, and theme parks combined. Relative to other kinds of gambling, people get ‘problematically involved’ with slot machines 3–4x faster according to NYU professor Natasha Dow Schull, author of Addiction by Design. But here’s the unfortunate truth — several billion people have a slot machine their pocket: When we pull our phone out of our pocket, we’re playing a slot machine to see what notifications we got. When we pull to refresh our email, we’re playing a slot machine to see what new email we got. When we swipe down our finger to scroll the Instagram feed, we’re playing a slot machine to see what photo comes next. When we swipe faces left/right on dating apps like Tinder, we’re playing a slot machine to see if we got a match. When we tap the # of red notifications, we’re playing a slot machine to what’s underneath. Apps and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their products because it’s good for business. But in other cases, slot machines emerge by accident. For example, there is no malicious corporation behind all of email who consciously chose to make it a slot machine. No one profits when millions check their email and nothing’s there. Neither did Apple and Google’s designers want phones to work like slot machines. It emerged by accident. But now companies like Apple and Google have a responsibility to reduce these effects by converting intermittent variable rewards into less addictive, more predictable ones with better design. For example, they could empower people to set predictable times during the day or week for when they want to check “slot machine” apps, and correspondingly adjust when new messages are delivered to align with those times. Hijack #3: Fear of Missing Something Important (FOMSI) Another way apps and websites hijack people’s minds is by inducing a “1% chance you could be missing something important.” If I convince you that I’m a channel for important information, messages, friendships, or potential sexual opportunities — it will be hard for you to turn me off, unsubscribe, or remove your account — because (aha, I win) you might miss something important: This keeps us subscribed to newsletters even after they haven’t delivered recent benefits (“what if I miss a future announcement?”) This keeps us “friended” to people with whom we haven’t spoke in ages (“what if I miss something important from them?”) This keeps us swiping faces on dating apps, even when we haven’t even met up with anyone in a while (“what if I miss that one hot match who likes me?”) This keeps us using social media (“what if I miss that important news story or fall behind what my friends are talking about?”) But if we zoom into that fear, we’ll discover that it’s unbounded: we’ll always miss something important at any point when we stop using something. There are magic moments on Facebook we’ll miss by not using it for the 6th hour (e.g. an old friend who’s visiting town right now). There are magic moments we’ll miss on Tinder (e.g. our dream romantic partner) by not swiping our 700th match. There are emergency phone calls we’ll miss if we’re not connected 24/7. But living moment to moment with the fear of missing something isn’t how we’re built to live. And it’s amazing how quickly, once we let go of that fear, we wake up from the illusion. When we unplug for more than a day, unsubscribe from those notifications, or go to Camp Grounded — the concerns we thought we’d have don’t actually happen. We don’t miss what we don’t see. The thought, “what if I miss something important?” is generated in advance of unplugging, unsubscribing, or turning off — not after. Imagine if tech companies recognized that, and helped us proactively tune our relationships with friends and businesses in terms of what we define as “time well spent” for our lives, instead of in terms of what we might miss. Hijack #4: Social Approval Easily one of the most persuasive things a human being can receive. We’re all vulnerable to social approval. The need to belong, to be approved or appreciated by our peers is among the highest human motivations. But now our social approval is in the hands of tech companies. When I get tagged by my friend Marc, I imagine him making a conscious choice to tag me. But I don’t see how a company like Facebook orchestrated his doing that in the first place. Facebook, Instagram or SnapChat can manipulate how often people get tagged in photos by automatically suggesting all the faces people should tag (e.g. by showing a box with a 1-click confirmation, “Tag Tristan in this photo?”). So when Marc tags me, he’s actually responding to Facebook’s suggestion, not making an independent choice. But through design choices like this, Facebook controls the multiplier for how often millions of people experience their social approval on the line. Facebook uses automatic suggestions like this to get people to tag more people, creating more social externalities and interruptions. The same happens when we change our main profile photo — Facebook knows that’s a moment when we’re vulnerable to social approval: “what do my friends think of my new pic?” Facebook can rank this higher in the news feed, so it sticks around for longer and more friends will like or comment on it. Each time they like or comment on it, we’ll get pulled right back. Everyone innately responds to social approval, but some demographics (teenagers) are more vulnerable to it than others. That’s why it’s so important to recognize how powerful designers are when they exploit this vulnerability. Hijack #5: Social Reciprocity (Tit-for-tat) You do me a favor — I owe you one next time. You say, “thank you”— I have to say “you’re welcome.” You send me an email— it’s rude not to get back to you. You follow me — it’s rude not to follow you back. (especially for teenagers) We are vulnerable to needing to reciprocate others’ gestures. But as with Social Approval, tech companies now manipulate how often we experience it. In some cases, it’s by accident. Email, texting and messaging apps are social reciprocity factories. But in other cases, companies exploit this vulnerability on purpose. LinkedIn is the most obvious offender. LinkedIn wants as many people creating social obligations for each other as possible, because each time they reciprocate (by accepting a connection, responding to a message, or endorsing someone back for a skill) they have to come back to linkedin.com where they can get people to spend more time. Like Facebook, LinkedIn exploits an asymmetry in perception. When you receive an invitation from someone to connect, you imagine that person making a conscious choice to invite you, when in reality, they likely unconsciously responded to LinkedIn’s list of suggested contacts. In other words, LinkedIn turns your unconscious impulses (to “add” a person) into new social obligations that millions of people feel obligated to repay. All while they profit from the time people spend doing it. Imagine millions of people getting interrupted like this throughout their day, running around like chickens with their heads cut off, reciprocating each other — all designed by companies who profit from it. Welcome to social media. After accepting an endorsement, LinkedIn takes advantage of your bias to reciprocate by offering *four* additional people for you to endorse in return. Imagine if technology companies had a responsibility to minimize social reciprocity. Or if there was an independent organization that represented the public’s interests — an industry consortium or an FDA for tech — that monitored when technology companies abused these biases? Hijack #6: Bottomless bowls, Infinite Feeds, and Autoplay YouTube autoplays the next video after a countdown Another way to hijack people is to keep them consuming things, even when they aren’t hungry anymore. How? Easy. Take an experience that was bounded and finite, and turn it into a bottomless flow that keeps going. Cornell professor Brian Wansink demonstrated this in his study showing you can trick people into keep eating soup by giving them a bottomless bowl that automatically refills as they eat. With bottomless bowls, people eat 73% more calories than those with normal bowls and underestimate how many calories they ate by 140 calories. Tech companies exploit the same principle. News feeds are purposely designed to auto-refill with reasons to keep you scrolling, and purposely eliminate any reason for you to pause, reconsider or leave. It’s also why video and social media sites like Netflix, YouTube or Facebook autoplay the next video after a countdown instead of waiting for you to make a conscious choice (in case you won’t). A huge portion of traffic on these websites is driven by autoplaying the next thing. Facebook autoplays the next video after a countdown Tech companies often claim that “we’re just making it easier for users to see the video they want to watch” when they are actually serving their business interests. And you can’t blame them, because increasing “time spent” is the currency they compete for. Instead, imagine if technology companies empowered you to consciously bound your experience to align with what would be “time well spent” for you. Not just bounding the quantity of time you spend, but the qualities of what would be “time well spent.” Hijack #7: Instant Interruption vs. “Respectful” Delivery Companies know that messages that interrupt people immediately are more persuasive at getting people to respond than messages delivered asynchronously (like email or any deferred inbox). Given the choice, Facebook Messenger (or WhatsApp, WeChat or SnapChat for that matter) would prefer to design their messaging system to interrupt recipients immediately (and show a chat box) instead of helping users respect each other’s attention. In other words, interruption is good for business. It’s also in their interest to heighten the feeling of urgency and social reciprocity. For example, Facebook automatically tells the sender when you “saw” their message, instead of letting you avoid disclosing whether you read it (“now that you know I’ve seen the message, I feel even more obligated to respond.”) By contrast, Apple more respectfully lets users toggle “Read Receipts” on or off. The problem is, maximizing interruptions in the name of business creates a tragedy of the commons, ruining global attention spans and causing billions of unnecessary interruptions each day. This is a huge problem we need to fix with shared design standards (potentially, as part of Time Well Spent). Hijack #8: Bundling Your Reasons with Their Reasons Another way apps hijack you is by taking your reasons for visiting the app (to perform a task) and make them inseparable from the app’s business reasons (maximizing how much we consume once we’re there). For example, in the physical world of grocery stores, the #1 and #2 most popular reasons to visit are pharmacy refills and buying milk. But grocery stores want to maximize how much people buy, so they put the pharmacy and the milk at the back of the store. In other words, they make the thing customers want (milk, pharmacy) inseparable from what the business wants. If stores were truly organized to support people, they would put the most popular items in the front. Tech companies design their websites the same way. For example, when you you want to look up a Facebook event happening tonight (your reason) the Facebook app doesn’t allow you to access it without first landing on the news feed (their reasons), and that’s on purpose. Facebook wants to convert every reason you have for using Facebook, into their reason which is to maximize the time you spend consuming things. Instead, imagine if … Twitter gave you a separate way to post an Tweet than having to see their news feed. Facebook gave a separate way to look up Facebook Events going on tonight, without being forced to use their news feed. Facebook gave you a separate way to use Facebook Connect as a passport for creating new accounts on 3rd party apps and websites, without being forced to install Facebook’s entire app, news feed and notifications. In a Time Well Spent world, there is always a direct way to get what you want separately from what businesses want. Imagine a digital “bill of rights” outlining design standards that forced the products used by billions of people to let them navigate directly to what they want without needing to go through intentionally placed distractions. Imagine if web browsers empowered you to navigate directly to what you want — especially for sites that intentionally detour you toward their reasons. Hijack #9: Inconvenient Choices We’re told that it’s enough for businesses to “make choices available.” “If you don’t like it you can always use a different product.” “If you don’t like it, you can always unsubscribe.” “If you’re addicted to our app, you can always uninstall it from your phone.” Businesses naturally want to make the choices they want you to make easier, and the choices they don’t want you to make harder. Magicians do the same thing. You make it easier for a spectator to pick the thing you want them to pick, and harder to pick the thing you don’t. For example, NYTimes.com lets you “make a free choice” to cancel your digital subscription. But instead of just doing it when you hit “Cancel Subscription,” they send you an email with information on how to cancel your account by calling a phone number that’s only open at certain times. NYTimes claims it’s giving a free choice to cancel your account Instead of viewing the world in terms of availability of choices, we should view the world in terms of friction required to enact choices. Imagine a world where choices were labeled with how difficult they were to fulfill (like coefficients of friction) and there was an independent entity — an industry consortium or non-profit — that labeled these difficulties and set standards for how easy navigation should be. Hijack #10: Forecasting Errors, “Foot in the Door” strategies Facebook promises an easy choice to “See Photo.” Would we still click if it gave the true price tag? Lastly, apps can exploit people’s inability to forecast the consequences of a click. People don’t intuitively forecast the true cost of a click when it’s presented to them. Sales people use “foot in the door” techniques by asking for a small innocuous request to begin with (“just one click to see which tweet got retweeted”) and escalate from there (“why don’t you stay awhile?”). Virtually all engagement websites use this trick. Imagine if web browsers and smartphones, the gateways through which people make these choices, were truly watching out for people and helped them forecast the consequences of clicks (based on real data about what benefits and costs it actually had?). That’s why I add “Estimated reading time” to the top of my posts. When you put the “true cost” of a choice in front of people, you’re treating your users or audience with dignity and respect. In a Time Well Spent internet, choices could be framed in terms of projected cost and benefit, so people were empowered to make informed choices by default, not by doing extra work. TripAdvisor uses a “foot in the door” technique by asking for a single click review (“How many stars?”) while hiding the three page survey of questions behind the click. Summary And How We Can Fix This Are you upset that technology hijacks your agency? I am too. I’ve listed a few techniques but there are literally thousands. Imagine whole bookshelves, seminars, workshops and trainings that teach aspiring tech entrepreneurs techniques like these. Imagine hundreds of engineers whose job every day is to invent new ways to keep you hooked. The ultimate freedom is a free mind, and we need technology that’s on our team to help us live, feel, think and act freely. We need our smartphones, notifications screens and web browsers to be exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships that put our values, not our impulses, first. People’s time is valuable. And we should protect it with the same rigor as privacy and other digital rights.

Stephen Lam/Getty Images People don’t hate advertisements, what they hate is being watched. Okay, people aren’t nuts about ads themselves, either, but the real hostility to internet advertising is that they track users so aggressively. That tracking invades privacy and costs users money and time. Ad networks also stymie publishers from switching to HTTPS, a more secure way to serve web pages to users. Most people who object to tracking use ad blockers, like Ghostery or AdBlock. Firefox, in fact, has tracker blocking built in. Some web users aren’t satisfied with just shutting trackers down, however. They want to take it a step further and corrupt the trackers’ data. Enter AdNauseam, a browser extension that’s still available on Firefox and Opera. Created by Dr. Helen Nissenbaum, Mushon Zer-Aviv and Daniel Howe, it hides in the background clicking on every single ad while the user browses the web. It is meant to protest against tracking rather than protecting privacy. Browser extensions ad new functionality from the web. They have to be intentionally added by a user from that browsers’ store. With extensions, users can hide objectionable content with photos of kittens. Extensions might also, however, also serve really terrible spyware. When web users install AdNauseam, it serves as a functional piece of art in code, collectively expressing a pro-privacy sentiment shared by its makers and users. The Observer spoke to Howe after he unveiled AdNauseam 2.0. Version 3.0 came out in November. On January 1, users of the extension began contacting the AdNauseam team saying that it had been banned from the Chrome store. Today, the AdNauseam team posted the following statement: We wrote Google to ask the reason for this sudden move and they responded that AdNauseam had breached the Web Store’s terms of service, stating that “An extension should have a single purpose that is clear to users…”, but providing no detail as to what the multiple purposes might be. To be clear, AdNauseam has a single purpose which we believe to be readily apparent to users; namely to fight back against the mass surveillance conducted by advertising networks, of which Google is a prime example. It continued: It is frightening to think that at any moment Google can quietly make your extensions and data disappear, without so much as a warning. Today it is your privacy tool, tomorrow it is your photo album or password manager. Wikipedia has collected various sources with estimates of the total market share of different browsers. Estimates generally place Chrome at 50 percent of the market or higher. AdNauseam takes credit for many thousands of people using its extension in its statement. That’s impressive, but far short of the many hundreds of millions of people Google reaches. Mountain View might simply have a zero tolerance policy for anyone trifling with its business model or tracker data is easier to corrupt than activists suspected. Twitter users are slowly building up a rallying cry for the service: Looks like Google took down Ad Nauseam. Hope it was a mistake and that it will be restored asap. https://t.co/CIkUvHVN0i #FreeADNAUSEAM — Job Plas (@JobPlas) January 5, 2017 TIL Google is not evil unless there's money to be made in which case they happily are #freeadnauseamhttps://t.co/RfeE2juFW0 — Maximilien Riehl (@MaximilienRiehl) January 5, 2017 Adnauseam removed from chrome web store for fight against mass surveillance of advertising networks https://t.co/j8nHkXsFGm #FreeADNAUSEAM — John Brett 🇮🇪 (@johnbrett_) January 5, 2017 Google was not immediately available for comment. In its post, AdNauseam reported that after contacting the Chrome Store team, it was told that AdNauseam violated its terms of service by not having a “single purpose that is clear to users.” While the team behind the completely open source project believed its users really did know the extension’s purpose, it has resubmitted its extension with language it believes should be even more explicit. Technical users that want to use Chrome with AdNauseam can still do so via this workaround on Github, though it requires using Chrome in developer mode. For users that used the data the extension collected about the ads it clicked, this workaround permits access to that information once again. We will update this story as we learn more.

The potential of IoT has never been in question, though the role of smart homes is one which is yet to wow the mass market. The idea is great, but market penetration has been slow. IoT light bulbs, or smart fridges have been around for quite a while, but uptake has not been exceptional. With the introduction of personal assistants as part of the smart home hub, the tide is slowly beginning to turn however. Amazon made a strong claim to be winning the PR battle with this week with its Alexa artificial intelligence proposition. Aside from its own branded products, for example the Amazon Echo or the Amazon Dot, this years’ CES has seen the eCommerce heavy-weight partner with numerous brands to integrate the AI system into third-party products. Lenovo has developed its own smart speaker systems which includes the Alexa AI system, and Intel did the same thing with its Smart Home hub before Christmas. While this has been a positive couple of weeks for Amazon, Google is never too far away. The Google Assistant is making its way to Android TV and Nvidia has launched Spot, a smart home device, which integrates the Google Assistant as opposed to building its own AI system. Apple has been very quiet during the conference, but that is hardly unusual, as such events are far too common place for the high-horsed brand, but you can probably expect a Siri update in the next couple of weeks. The initial battle for each of the brands is not only to get their own AI system into the consumer’s home, but also to prove it is actually useful. AI maybe gaining credibility, though there will still be many people around the world who will struggle to trust a computer. Proving the AI is competent, secure and useful is arguably the more important battle than that of the physical devices due to the nature of product lifecycles. When you buy a smart home hub currently, you buy the AI system which comes with it. But it won’t be long before you can buy an empty shell and select the AI system of your choice. This is the most important aspect of the smart home. Once you have the AI into an individual’s living room, you also the gateway into that person’s life and subsequently the revenues which can be derived from it. Controlling the information gateway will be one of the most important battles of the consumer IoT war. The battle for IoT revenues will be based on the same business model that internet companies have used for years: prove a proposition is useful to the consumer and then monetize it afterwards. Making this model work can prove difficult and expensive, but the long-terms gains can be incredible. Just ask Mark Zuckerberg. There are numerous social media sites currently, though Facebook is widely recognized as the most successful in the western world. Facebook has arguably become one of the most important websites for the majority of millennials. It’s where they communicate with friends, it’s where photos are stored, it’s how they find out about milestones in other people’s lives and for some it’s where they find their news. Now think back to when you first signed up to Facebook, how many adverts were there? Not many right? Zuckerberg lured us into his online world, and once he controlled a single gateway to hundreds of millions of consumers, he hit the heavy advertising button hard, creating one of the biggest marketing platform for brands around the world. It’s the internet business model. Make something useful and valuable to as many people as possible for free and then monetize it; it’s the new way to do business. You can see gateways opening everywhere in the media world as well. Freezines and Free-newspapers are appearing at every train station, slowly expanding their own audiences for publishers to reclaim lost subscription revenues. YouTube advertising is becoming more advanced. Freemium apps and content production sites are now the norm. Data is the new currency, and you are the metric. We’re unlikely to see anyone AI platform dominate the living room, though the potential for this market is significant. Brands are looking for new ways to engage customers and encourage buying decisions from the cash-conscious consumer, and in a world of multi-platform marketing, the smart home hub certainly adds another dimension. How Amazon, Google and co. advance their own AI platforms will define the success of the smart home. Older generations may have a natural disposition to mistrust a computer with any important decisions, though this element of credibility will define the size of the audience which these gateways offer. The larger the audience, the more congested the bottle-neck, and therefore the greater the revenues gained through the turn style. It took Facebook a long-time to generate this credibility and the subsequent gateway, however the masses are more open to digital platforms nowadays. Another area to consider is the purchasing power of the personal assistants. How long will it be before we trust computers to make purchasing decisions for us? Could you trust a computer to build your shopping list and schedule a time for a delivery to your home? With the introduction of smart fridges, and AI personal assistants which can access your diary, the idea is perfectly feasible in the near future, but will people trust Google to do their shopping? If yes, this could open up an entirely new segment. Back in October, we spoke to Gregory Roekens, Future Technology Officer at advertising agency Grey about the role AI will have in future brand marketing campaigns. Roekens has been looking into how AI and other next generation technologies will impact consumer spending habits, and subsequently, how this will change the way brands communicate with the consumer. If (or when) we get to a stage where AI personal assistants are trusted with purchasing decisions, how will brands communicate with and influence AI? How do you advertise to robots? Roekens highlighted that while AI is new, we all have a techno-trail already. We have all left our fingerprints in the digital world which allow marketers to understand and best pitch an idea to the AI. With machine learning components, you AI personal assistant should be personalized to you, and in theory an extension of your buying habits. In the future, it could in theory be making the same decisions as you. Now it’s still a long way off, but it takes personalized advertising to a whole new level. Imagine if the brands start taking on AI as advertising solutions. AI will be pitching AI, and you won’t even need to be awake for it. That AI personal assistant extension of you will be switched on 24/7, and a target for brands all over the world. This is why the battle for home could be one of the most important the technology companies have faced to date. Personalization is about to be taken to a new level, and brands could have access to consumers which has never been experienced before. Like search engines or the smartphone or social media, those who get the smart home right could redefine their own organizations. Google nailed search engines and Yahoo didn’t; look what happened there. iOS and Android nailed smartphone operating systems and Windows didn’t; look what happened there. Facebook nailed social media and Myspace didn’t; look what happened there. The battle for the living room gateway is just beginning, and it’ll be a good one.

By Michael Havis / Published 4th January 2017 GOOGLE/GETTY SWEPT AWAY: The rogue wave struck Goolawah beach in Crescent Head, New South Wales, Australia The group, which included up to 12 children, suffered a range of injuries in the bizarre incident. Luckily, there were no fatalities among the group, who were swimming near Crescent Head in New South Wales, Australia. However 10 of them needed hospital treatment, one for a fractured arm and another for a gash to the head. GOOGLE SUN KISSED: The group were bathing in rock pools on the beach when the wave hit “That hit and we all went off in different directions” Sophie Shepherd Nine were taken to Kempsey district hospital for treatment, and one to Port Macquarie Hospital. One of the group, Sophie Shepherd, said there were three waves; the second was the worst. She said: "The first one happened and we were all good… we were like 'ok, it’s fine' "The second one was the one that hit and we all went off in different directions." Britain's killer coastlines Thursday, 25th August 2016 Great Britain is known for dangerous coastlines where waves can reach as high as 16ft, and that have taken a number of people's lives. We take a look at moments where Britain's coastlines become monstrous 1 / 12 Getty Images Winter storms hit the rocky coastline with monumental force at Land's End in Cornwall Ms Shepherd told NBN she was dragged herself from the water and called for help. Everyone else was rescued from the base of a nearby cliff by volunteers and medics. The Westpac Rescue helicopter also came to help, but no patients required air transport. The beach is located in the Goolawah National Park and was hard to reach, an ambulance spokesman said.

From Facebook’s big push in live video, to Instagram muscling in on Snapchat’s stories format, the tussle between social networks has been fierce as each platform battles for a share of your attention. We’ve also seen social media affect globally significant events like the “Brexit” referendum in the UK and the US election, as politicians wise up to the impact social networks can have on public opinion. We’re now spending almost 2 hours a day on social media or about 15 percent of our time awake. So what will 2017 bring and what social media trends do businesses need to be aware of next year? That’s the question we posed to some of the biggest names in the social media world. Here are eight trends they expect to see next year. #1: The power of social media giants will increase It’s no secret that the giants of social media world want people to spend more time on their networks and not your own website. As user numbers grow and internet users spend an increasing amount of time on social, it’s time for social media marketers to work out how this will affect their strategy in 2017 say Michael Stelzner and Eric T. Tung. “Algorithms, bots, artificial intelligence and people working for very big companies will destroy the business models of people who produce content by disrupting the free flow of information. In the very near future, information flow will be filtered and measured and censored in the name of “reducing clutter” and revealing “only what’s important.” Facebook will decide what you see. Google will serve up only that content that complies with its rules and are housed on its servers. Email solutions like Gmail and Yahoo will tighten their own algorithms so even reaching the inbox is at risk. The information distribution highway will have toll stations that must be paid for by the those who create content. If you want your content seen, you’ll need to house it inside the companies that control the toll stations. Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and more will incentivize content creators to not link to off-site content. These large businesses will become the equivalent of the 1990’s America Online–a type of Hotel California,” where you can enter but never leave. Traffic to websites will decline and blogs will shut down. Gone will be the days of information flow and true information freedom. The future will only be more controlled, more filtered and less open. Are you ready for the change? Social media in 2017 will continue to change and consolidate. We’re going to see more acquisitions, as power continues to collect in the hands of a few, and smaller players who can’t monetize will be left behind. Devices will be more integrated into marketing and entertainment, augmented reality, virtual reality, and 360 video will become mainstream. Twitter and Yahoo will become shells of their former selves and become acquired. And companies will need to reformulate social strategy and content strategy to provide more levels of education, entertainment, and education, rather than the thinly-veiled marketing collateral it’s become. We probably won’t see GM or AT&T doing BuzzFeed like video stunts, but people will be less and less tolerant of marketing crap. #2: The fight back against fake news will begin The issue of “fake news” came to the fore towards the end of 2016 with Facebook in particular feeling the force of public backlash. Rand Fishkin and Gini Dietrich believe the likes of Facebook and Twitter will make a concerted effort to stop this phenomenon from spreading next year. Fishkin says, “I expect social media platforms in the year ahead to at least face and possibly tackle some of the most controversial and challenging aspects of the amplification they provide. Specifically, I think we’re going to see Twitter double down on features that limit abusive aspects and Facebook to address the issues of fake news, false claims, and inaccurate “facts” on their platform. Google has already worked on this to a degree with their algorithms focused on accuracy (as reported by NPR). My expectation is that amplification of false information will become more difficult, and that abusive and threatening behaviour will as well. One might have hoped that this would be addressed earlier in the life of these platforms, but I think the executives at Facebook and Twitter required the powerful catalysts of 2016 to prioritize modifications. ” Dietrich adds, “While this isn’t a trend I want to see take hold, if the U.S. presidential election has taught us anything, it’s fake news sells. And what does that mean to marketers? Those executives and business owners who are willing to do what it takes, no matter if it’s ethical or not, will undoubtedly apply similar tactics to their marketing plans. The list of potential motives is endless: Anti-corporate activism, unsavory union tactics, competitive harassment, dissatisfied shareholders, unethical stock traders, even ethics-challenged, bottom-feeding PR practitioners. “It’s up to marketers to do three things—and be vigilant about them: 1) Verify the validity of every piece of news before we share it anywhere, 2) Build an internal discussion around what to do if a competitor spreads fake news about our organizations or executives and 3) Refuse to do work with anyone who wants us to do this. This isn’t a trend just for the United States. Every part of the world will see this affect their marketing plans. Be diligent in making sure, at this time next year, we have beat this “trend.” #3: From social networks to social messaging While the every increasing usage of social networks is a regular feature of online news, user numbers pale in comparison to social messaging apps. As French social media influencer Isabelle Mathieu (@isabellemathieu) points out, the biggest social messaging apps now have a larger community than the biggest social networks with market leader Whatsapp hitting the 1 billion user mark in February 2016. According to Mathieu: “Until recently, companies had focused their efforts on social networks but in 2017, they will start investing massively in social messaging applications. These apps have a wide audience and offer several attractive features to brands for e-commerce and client support, for example, which allows for economies of scale and the creation of new types of user experience. Let’s not forget that the four main messaging apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Viber) together have a wider community than the four main social networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram).” #4: More targeting and more integration With ever growing numbers of people using social networks, the level of noise on social media is also increasing, making it harder and harder for brand messages to be heard. Dave Chaffey (@davechaffey) and Neal Schaffer (@NealSchaffer) predict that this will lead to a greater need for targeting messages using smart technological integrations and better social media tactics. Chaffey: Social media doesn’t exist in a vacuum, although it is sometimes managed in such a way that it is with limited integration with other parts of marketing. In 2017, I’m expecting to see more use of services and APIs to integrate social media with CRM, Marketing Automation and social media prospecting and retargeting ad platforms. For example, we use Clearbit to understand and interact with our B2B audiences on social media. Connections between social media and CRM or retargeting apps to give opportunities for ‘hypertargeted’ personal messaging are possible via API services like Zapier, Piesync or Automate.io. A consumer example of hypertargeting is when Vauxhall Motors partnered with Twitter to send personalised videos to football fans via DMs from players in the Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales national teams, thanking them for their ongoing support. The individual targeting of the personalised content will be sent out on the platform over a two-week period.” Schaffer: “2017 will continue to see an evolution of the many things we saw in 2016, so rather than it being a revolutionary year, it will be an evolutionary one. That being said, my advice for businesses who want to maximize their social in 2017 to adapt to this evolution would be the following. Influencer Marketing: Brands need to graduate from throwing $$ at people with large networks and instead focus on influencers that truly help them meet their objectives. If it’s SEO you’re looking for, you don’t need to be targeting Instagrammers and instead might want to focus on bloggers who may or may not be an “influencer” in social media. On the other hand, if brands would celebrate their fans more often in social media, these brand advocates can become influencers in their own right, and this is the approach that I recommend to brands before investing in transactional influencer relationships versus long-term mutually beneficial brand advocacy relationships. Paid Social: The days of organic social media success are over. It’s not a question of paying for playing but of how much you pay to play. In order to do so, you need to create your own revenue attribution model algorithm, measure, and optimize. Failing to create rational attribution models keeps many brands from underinvesting in social and missing out on opportunities to leverage the communities and data (custom audiences, et. al.) they already own. Visual Content: In 2016, content is already a commodity. That is, the written type of content is a commodity. Brands should focus less on quantity of written content (blogs, et. al.) and instead have a “less is more” approach by focusing on quality. However, visual content is not a commodity, and this is where brands should be investing more of their budgets, whether in user-generated campaigns to source photographic content, creating more and more videos, or doing more and more live streams, this visual content area will help you truly cut through the noise and be heard.” #5: The social storytelling evolution Good storytelling has always been a key component of effective marketing, long before social networks even existed. But social media innovations are changing the way audiences consume stories and Andrew Hutchinson (@adhutchinson) and Pratik Dholakiya (@DholakiyaPratik) both predict that brands will need to keep up with the evolution of social storytelling if they want to remain relevant. Hutchinson: “In 2017, we’re going to see more emphasis on ‘social storytelling’ to help better engage audiences on social platforms. Now, storytelling is nothing new of course – it’s been a key part of how we interact since the dawn of time – but new uses of social, like Snapchat Stories, which add more context and immediacy to what we share, are changing audience expectations on how we communicate our messages. The trend is best exemplified by Instagram copying the Stories format – Instagram says 100 million users are already using their Stories feature every day, while more than 50 million use the same function on Snapchat. In addition to this, Facebook’s testing out ‘Messenger Day’, a similar social storytelling tool within Messenger, while Twitter recently opened ‘Moments’ to all users. “Right now, this might not seem like a big deal, but cumulatively, that’s a lot of younger users engaging with this format, and younger users are the ones who drive future trends. Given this, it would be beneficial for brands to start investigating and putting into action steps to add more storytelling elements into their social marketing plans – more immediate, multi-scene narratives that help better connect users to their brand story and purpose, which really works to enhance the ‘social” element.” Dholakiya: “Just like curiosity killed the cat, over-sharing can mar all your content marketing efforts. People tend to sway towards bite-sized pieces of information that catches their fancy. So something on the lines of micro-blogging, short and succinct posts or Snapchat stories for that matter, can become a huge trend in the time to come. Similarly, the expertise of social media influencers is all set to expand in the travel and tourism sector. They may be invited to go on junkets and share their experiences using the latest features on social media viz 360-degree videos, live streaming, vlogs etc. Additionally, social media reaction buttons are the ‘next big thing’ for various channels. “We have already seen them on Facebook and how marketers can use them to increase user engagements on a page or a post. In the near future, we can definitely expect something similar. Short-lived content such as self-destructing content on Snapchat (and now on Instagram) is another trend that we can watch out for in 2017. The posts may be conditioned to expire in say, an hour, a day or in a couple of days. Another trend that I think we would see is use of Chatbots. With the latest technologies in tow, they are becoming more impressive and I wouldn’t be surprised if we have a LinkedIn chatbot in place soon.” #6: Virtual reality meets social media In 2016 virtual, augmented and mixed reality took the world by storm. With the giants of tech all investing heavily in this new area 2017 could be the year that VR adoption becomes widespread and enters the realm of social networks say Martin Shervington (@martivsherv). Shervington: “In 2017 we will see the next phase of platform adoption in VR, including Facebook’s Oculus. We know this is 10 year plan for Facebook, and having been diving deep I think people will be surprised at the existing level of sophistication.) Add in HTC and Google to the mix, and we will have increased understanding of the potential of virtual spaces – including what it will mean for social and business. Add in consumer 360 content to the mix, with a push from YouTube and Facebook too, there will be fun for consumers and producers alike. (It’s time to get creative and ready to explore what we all know will be a big wave of change.” #7: Trust is the next frontier The growth of fake news has had a major impact on people’s trust of information on social networks. Not just news and political statements but even brand messages. With so much competition for digital space, David Amerland (@DavidAmerland) and Tim Fargo (@alphabetsuccess) predict that next year, it will be the brands that can foster genuine trust with their audience on social that will be successful. Amerland: “In just about every digital vertical we are seeing the same trend: technology is producing incremental improvements in the user experience and the flow of data captured is producing an ever increasing granularity in the way we connect with people, companies and brands to create working relationships, form impressions of them and understand the values that drive them. This produces the interesting paradox of the importance of human qualities in a domain that is increasingly controlled by machines. When the traditional barriers to connectivity that were posed by the technical challenge of overcoming lack of proximity, access to content, an interactive digital presence and a high-quality connection, are removed what truly remains is the perception of whether we can trust who we are dealing with or not. Trust in a digital environment where every step we take is a studied one and where everything can be controlled, altered and manipulated presents both a challenge and an opportunity. “The challenge lies in understanding the myriad ways through which trust is experienced and formed. The opportunity lies in establishing connections with our audience that have lasting value because they appeal to the core identity of who we are and what we consider to be important. Neither of these can be undertaken lightly, nor can it be said to be easy but it is how companies, brands and individuals will now differentiate themselves from the crowd, form networks of contacts that give them influence and establish their dominance in a crowded marketplace.” Fargo: “People will continue to be enamored with hacks and with vanity metrics. While being able to draw people to your content is important, having content that converts people to paying fans is the key. When you can get attention AND engender trust, you’re on your way to getting paying fans. Money spent is the ultimate metric. Therein lies the danger of click bait. If the content doesn’t match up to the headline or visual, you’ve violated a person’s trust. It may seem a small thing but, when people are making millisecond decisions and evaluations, it may be the last time you get their attention. In social media , the desire to get attention should always be governed by the requirement of deserving it. When you make a difference in your audience’s life, they’ll start making one in yours. That’s the real “hack”.” #8: Businesses will need to learn to sell on social In the end it comes down to the bottom line. Can we trace revenues back to social media activity? Getting better at selling on social will be key for both social networks and the businesses that use social media in 2017 say Marsha Collier (@MarshaCollier) and Ian Cleary (@IanCleary). Collier: “In 2017, business will have to figure out what works for them in Social Media. There’s been a lot of new platforms distracting from the end goal – of selling. Rather than chasing shiny objects everywhere, center on the psychographics (what your customer cares about) versus their demographics. These days passions are more powerful than statistical data.” Cleary: “In 2017 we’ll see a major push from Facebook for selling through Facebook and other providers will follow. There is no reason why people will not buy on social media channels if the social media channels create an environment for sales.” Share.

The U.S. Department of Labor is suing Google for compensation data Posted Jan 5, 2017 by Megan Rose Dickey (@meganrosedickey) 0 SHARES Next Story DJI acquires majority stake in Hasselblad, the iconic Swedish camera company The U.S. Department of Labor recently filed a lawsuit against Google in an attempt to obtain compensation data from the tech giant as part of a routine compliance evaluation. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs asked Google to submit information about the company’s equal opportunity program and practices in September 2015, but Google did not comply, according to the lawsuit. Since Google is a federal contractor, it is required to let the government review documents and other relevant information that is relevant to the company’s compliance with equal employment laws. “Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation,” said OFCCP Acting Director Thomas M. Dowd. “Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation.” Related Articles Palantir says it didn't racially discriminate against Asian people U.S. Department of Labor sues Palantir for racial discrimination Google's head of diversity is leaving the company If Google does not comply, the OFCCP says it will ask the court to cancel all of Google’s current contracts with the government, and also prevent it from obtaining contracts in the future. However, Google says it has provided “hundreds of thousands” of records, including information related to compensation, to the OFCCP, a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’re very committed to our affirmative action obligations, and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues,” the spokesperson said. “As a federal contractor, we’re familiar with our obligations and have worked collaboratively with the OFCCP.” The spokesperson went on to say that the requests made by the OFCCP “that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we’ve made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail. These requests include thousands of employees’ private contact information which we safeguard rigorously. We hope to continue working with OFCCP to resolve this matter.” Featured Image: JOSH EDELSON/Getty Images 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Today Google announced a new Calendar feature to help those people achieve their goal. Starting today, Google Fit and Apple Health can connect to Google Calendar. This feature will take data from your fitness apps and automatically mark your Google Calendar fitness goals as being completed, rather than forcing you to manually go in to Google Calendar and mark them as done when you finish. Google Calendar also now offers a visual performance tracker that’ll make it easier to see how close you are to completing your fitness goals. When you’re exercising and trying to meet a goal, it can be good to see all the progress that you’ve made. But sometimes when you’re done working out, you can forget to mark your progress in an app. That’s where this Google Calendar integration comes in handy, because it’ll automatically mark your goals as completed when you integrate with your Google Fit or Apple Health data, ensuring that all of your goals are checked off.

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation 10 Cool Gboard Features and How to Use Them Published by Karrar Haider, in Mobile Gboard, Google Keyboard with new name and interesting features, has just recently made its way to Andriod. Your Android phone would already be updated with this new default keyboard. If the old Google Keyboard’s limited features forced you to switch to a third-party Android keyboard, then Gboard might change your mind. 20 Essential Apps For Your Android Phone 20 Essential Apps For Your Android Phone The ever-growing Android Market is flooded with apps that never cease to push the boundaries for better user…Read more Gboard is just as light and fast as the old Google Keyboard, but it comes with unique new features. Below are 10 new Gboard features that you will surely love. 1. Built-in Google search The most talked about feature, Gboard now has a built in G button to quickly search your queries on Google Search. The search option is specially created for Gboard and it’s completely different in functionality. G button is not simply a shortcut to Google Search, meaning no additional apps will be opened when you will search through it. Instead, the search will show answer to your query using Google instant answers. If there is no answer available, then a link to the top result is shown. This search is basically created to help you access important information such as location, news, weather or a recent event and quickly share it with the person you are chatting with. For example, you can search for the location where you want to rendezvous, and share it with your friends. Sharing is also very easy as Gboard offers a special “Share” button that automatically pastes all the important searched content in the text field you are typing in. To use the Google Search inside Gboard: Tap on the big “G button” on the top left corner of the keyboard and you will see the search field. Type your query and hit enter to see the results. The search suggestions will also show up on top for you to easily choose from. If you get multiple results (like website articles), then tapping on one will enter its link in the text field. If there is a single result, like a location or definition of a word, press the “Share” button below to enter it in the text field. Furthermore, you will also see 3 quick access buttons when you will tap on the “G button”. These buttons allows you to quickly change themes, access keyboard settings and switch to “One Hand” mode (more on it later). 2. Spacebar as a Trackpad We all know how difficult it is to place the tiny cursor in the right spot when you need to amend a mistake while typing. Gboard solves this problem by allowing you to control the cursor using the spacebar key. Simply swipe your finger left or right on the spacebar to move the cursor in the respective direction. Unfortunately, you cannot swipe up or down to move the cursor between lines, but you can still use the old method of tapping to quickly place the cursor anywhere you like. 3. Quickly delete multiple words For quickly deleting one letter at a time, the delete button in the keyboard does a great job. However, if you want to delete the whole sentence, the delete button takes 1-2 seconds just to delete a single line. Gboard allows you to quickly get rid of multiple words with a single swipe. When you want to delete multiple words: Swipe left from the delete key (tap and swipe) and all the words will start highlighting. Once the required words are highlighted, raise your finger from the screen and they will be deleted. In the portrait mode, a single swipe usually allows you to delete 5-8 words. You can quickly swipe multiple times to delete more words. 4. Search for Emojis and GIFs Gboard has a new built-in search for emojis and GIFs that you can use to quickly find the right one. Tap on the “Emojis” button at the bottom right corner to access emojis. Here you should see a search bar on top. Tap on it and enter the type of emoji you need. For example, you can type “happy” to see emojis expressing happiness, or type “sad” to see emojis showing sadness. You can use this search bar to enter the emotion you are feeling and see quick results. Same goes for GIFs, but the GIF feature will only work in text fields where GIFs are allowed. You can also use names or contents inside the emoji or GIF to search for it. For example, you can type “water” to see emojis and GIF with water in them. 5. Multilingual typing With Gboard, you can type in multiple languages without needing to switch between them. You just need to specify the languages you want to use and Gboard will automatically detect and offer predictions according to the language. For example, if you like typing in English and Spanish simultaneously, then whenever you will enter a Spanish word while typing English, it will start predicting Spanish words. However, you will have to manually switch between keyboards if the secondary language is very different from the primary, such as English and Arabic. To specify the languages you want to use: Tap on the “G button” and then tap on the “Gear” icon to access Gboard settings. Here tap on “Languages” and you will see all the supported languages (over 120). Tap the button next to the ones you want to use to enable them. The languages will be automatically downloaded and available in Gboard. 6. Glide Typing This is not a new function, but a rather enhanced one. Swipe typing was always available in Google Keyboard, but with Gboard many improvements have been made. Now the animations are much smoother and their accuracy has also been enhanced. The glide typing feature is also much faster now and can handle your hyper swipe-typing speed. If you are interested in swipe-typing, then give Gboard another try. You will definitely be pleased. 7. Add a permanent Number Row Although this feature is already offered by other keyboard apps, but Google has now finally added it in its stock Android keyboard. You can now add a permanent number row at the top of the keyboard to quickly enter numbers. In order to enable it: Go to Settings from the “G button” and tap on “Preferences”. Here enable the option “Number Row” and you will see a number row at the top of the keyboard. 8. Use One Hand Mode It can be a big problem to type with one hand on a large display Android phones, such as LG V20. If you have such a device or have smaller hands, then you can use Gboard’s One Hand mode to easily type with one hand. One Hand mode will pin the keyboard at one corner of the screen (left or right) so you could easily type with all keys in reach. For enabling One Hand mode: Tap on the “G button” and click on “One Hand” mode icon in the middle One Hand mode will be enabled, and you can tap on the expand button on the side of it to switch back to normal mode. 9. Capitalize words easily Usually you need to tap the “Shift” key and tap the letter to add a capitalized letter. However, with Gboard you can simply tap on the “Shift” key and swipe to the letter that you want to capitalize and it will typed in its capital form. 10. Quickly enter symbols Similar to capitalization, you can also quickly enter symbols by swiping from “?123” key. Simply tap on the “?123” button and swipe upward. The page will immediately change to the symbols page. Now leave the swipe over the symbol that you want to use and it will be entered, and you will be automatically switched back to the main keyboard. This methods is definitely a whole lot faster. Some final thoughts Gboard is definitely a great improvement upon the Google Keyboard and it should entice many people to switch back to the default Android keyboard. I have personally moved to Gboard from Swiftkey, simply because it is lighter and the Google Search feature is definitely a keeper. Do let us know in the comments if you’ll be switching back to Gboard or not, and which Gboard features you like.

Share Tweet Share Share Email CES 2017 news reports have come out about the different innovations released at the Las Vegas event. One project that is generating a lot of buzz is BMW cars and GAP clothing’s Google’s Augmented Reality app. The application is said to be the tech giant’s most ambitious virtual reality venture. With it, shoppers can realistically check on things they plan to buy without having to leave their houses. Google’s big news at CES 2017 The Alphabet Inc. division unveiled the two new retail partnerships last Wednesday. Project Tango helped deploy the 3D-scanning collaborations. It is a technology that utilizes the cameras and sensors of different mobile devices. Digital images are then overlaid in physical space. Bloomberg likened Google’s Augmented Reality app to how Pokemon GO creatures can be found in the real world. Related: CES 2017: NVIDIA GeForce Now To Compete With Sony PlayStation Now Virtual BMW showrooms IDC analyst Chris Chute specifically expounded on the partnership between Google and BMW cars. According to him, the virtual reality component of car dealerships is expected to be a “longer-term and more profitable” project. Automobile manufacturers are supposedly very keen about trying new ways to reach buyers. Many are open to making sales without requiring too many visits to car showrooms. The app being tested by Google and BMW allows selected vehicles to be displayed on a smartphone screen. Interested buyers can then take a “virtual tour” around the high-definition, superimposed vehicle. Users can even “step inside” the vehicle, push buttons, and turn on the radio and lights. Furthermore, the shopper can easily tweak design details such as colors, types of trims, and wheels. Related: CES 2017: Biggest Trends In Tech To Watch Out For The next big thing this 2017 Meanwhile, as for the mobile app for Gap, shoppers can try on different pieces of clothing via a 3D digital avatar. This will look more realistic compared to just superimposing clothes on top of flat images. Other details revealed at the CES indicated that Google plans to go all out with this new technology. People expect the company to fuse its mapping capabilities with its core competencies in e-commerce. Aside from Google’s endeavors, there have been rapid developments in virtual and augmented reality over the past years. Analysts are anticipating that the retail industry will be among the largest beneficiaries of these innovations. A study from IDC predicted that the market for these projects will grow to $162 billion in 2020. This is from the estimated $5.2 billion market recorded in 2015.

Even the experts thought the victory was at least another decade away. But earlier this year, the Google DeepMind algorithm conquered its human opponent to win the tournament 4-1. AlphaGo is just one example of unforeseen AI progress over the past few years. And, as new trends and technologies emerge every week, who’s to say what the next five years have in store? IBM has decided to take another stab at the idea in its annual IBM 5 in 5 predictions, in which the company uses market and societal trends to predict scientific innovations that will revolutionize our lives in the next half decade. More: Man vs. machine: Google’s AlphaGo will battle humanity’s best Go player “5 in 5 began as a way to demonstrate the most exciting developments coming out of IBM Research, to generate collaborative conversations about the possibilities for innovation across various industries, and to promote excitement about how technology can be applied to solve certain societal problems and improve our daily lives,” Dario Gil, vice president of science and solutions at IBM Research, told Digital Trends. This year, the tech giant considered what instruments might make the invisible visible. Here are its predictions. “With AI, our words will be a window into our mental health” Mental health is a growing concern in communities around the world, where it serves as an emotional burden on people and economic burden on the societies they live in. Part of the difficulty is that, unlike most physical ailments, mental health conditions aren’t always easy to predict, prevent, or diagnose. But our words offer insight into our minds and researchers are unraveling the hidden messages within. “In five years, what we say and write will be used as indicators of our mental health and physical well being,” IBM predicts. “Patterns in our speech and writing analyzed by new cognitive systems will provide tell-tale signs of early-stage mental and neurological diseases that can help doctors and patients better predict, monitor, and track these diseases.” More: Just say something: IBM’s AI software can estimate a person’s age based on speech Researchers have recently used brushstrokes to predict neurological disorders in artists. IBM predicts that AI will soon use things like syntax and intonation for similar ends. “Hyperimaging and AI will give us superhero vision” Hi-tech instruments already help us image difficult-to-see regions, from deep space to deep within our bodies. But, as IBM notes, these instruments are limited to specific functions. “In five years, new imaging devices using hyperimaging technology and AI will help us see broadly beyond the domain of visible light by combining multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum to reveal valuable insights or potential dangers that would otherwise be unknown or hidden from view,” the company writes. “Most importantly, these devices will be portable, affordable, and accessible, so superhero vision can be part of our everyday experiences.” More: Cutting-edge metastasis prediction algorithm can accurately predict the spread of cancer As example, imagine a car windshield that helps drivers peer through fog or detect black ice. Or imagine a smartphone camera that can snap a photo of your dinner and give a breakdown its nutritional value. “Macroscopes will help us understand Earth’s complexity in infinite detail” IBM takes “macroscopes” to mean an instrument that offers insight into the interconnected and complex nature of our planet. Rather than revealing a small thing within a big thing, macroscopes reveal a big thing through the many small things that make it up. “In five years, we will use machine-learning algorithms and software to help us organize the information about the physical world to help bring the vast and complex data gathered by billions of devices within the range of our vision and understanding,” IBM predicts. “We call this a ‘macroscope’ — but unlike the microscope to see the very small, or the telescope that can see far away, it is a system of software and algorithms to bring all of Earth’s complex data together to analyze it for meaning.” “Medical labs ‘on a chip’ will serve as health detectives for tracing disease at the nanoscale” Take a functioning full-scale laboratory and crunch its capabilities down to something smaller than a USB stick — that’s a lab on a chip. Lab-on-a-chip technology may be able to detect biomakers from a handheld device, diagnosing diseases like Parkinson’s with ease. “In the next five years, new medical labs on a chip will serve as nanotechnology health detectives — tracing invisible clues in our bodily fluids and letting us know immediately if we have reason to see a doctor,” IBM writes. “The goal is to shrink down to a single silicon chip all of the processes necessary to analyze a disease that would normally be carried out in a full-scale biochemistry lab.” More: IBM’s “lab-on-a-chip” breakthrough brings ammo to the fight against cancer The feasibility of labs-on-chips has been debated but, if they prove possible, they could revolutionize medicine and bring health care to people who are otherwise disadvantaged. “Smart sensors will detect environmental pollution at the speed of light” We typically can’t see pollutants until they’re well past the point of safe return. Think toxic waste and smog. However, smart sensors can already pick up on the otherwise invisible chemical patterns in the air and even in our breath. By combining these sensors with the Internet of Thing (IoT), we may be able to detect contaminants early to avoid catastrophic events. “In five years, networks of IoT sensors wirelessly connected to the cloud will provide continuous monitoring of the vast natural gas infrastructure, allowing leaks to be found in a matter of minutes instead of weeks, reducing pollution and waste and the likelihood of catastrophic events,” IBM predicts.

Name: Subject: Message: Google’s CEO wants to see smartphones priced as low as $30 in India India Newsby John Callaham1 week ago 40 1561 20 Google clearly wants to sell more Android smartphones in India, one of the biggest and fastest growing markets for such devices. Today, India-born Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated today he would like to see smartphones in the country priced as low as $30 (Rs. 2000). See also: Best smartphones under $100 December 7, 2016 NDTV reports that Pichai made the remarks during an address at his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur. He stated he would “love to see cheaper smartphones, entry-level smartphones” and that he would like to see prices for those kinds of phones go down to $30, or about Rs. 2,000. Google has been trying to encourage smartphone makers to launch more affordable handsets through its Android One platform for the past couple of years, but so far it has met with mixed results. We have seen smartphones sold in India for prices similar to what Pichai would like to see, although their quality is not exactly high. We have also seen one case where a company tried to sell a smartphone for as low as $4 in India. However, that business, Ringing Bells, has since announced it has only shipped 70,000 units of that device so far, well below the company’s previous prediction of 2.5 million units. It will be interesting to see if smartphone makers can create entry-level devices that are both priced at $30 and also offer decent hardware and performance specs.

With the acquisition of Limes Audio, Google hopes to improve the audio experience in Hangouts video conferencing and Chromebox for Meetings. Founded in 2007, the Swedish company has focused on pushing the “limits of speech enhancement” to “provide the world’s best audio conferencing experience.” This has resulted in a two-way ‘TrueVoice’ communication audio processing software that gets rid of echos, enhances speech, suppresses background noise, and improves perceived audio quality. This Acoustic Echo Cancellation software can work with just one microphone or up to 12, with the company offering several reference designs of hardware that takes advantage of TrueVoice. In addition to software, Limes Audio also offers product development services to make custom hardware for customers, as well as design and engineering services and product benchmarking. Google notes that the acquisition was due to the increase in businesses adopting video conferencing solutions like Chromebox for Meetings and Google Hangouts. Conference rooms with different shapes and sizes prove an acoustic challenge as does poor internet connection. The Limes Audio team will be working closely with those groups “to introduce new solutions that offer our customers the best online voice quality on the market.” Hopefully, those enhancements will trickle down to the more consumer facing version of Hangouts in the near future.

By Oliver Cragg January 5, 2017 17:48 GMT Google Assistant is on its way to smartwatches, TV media players and moreGoogle With Amazon's Alexa technology making waves at CES 2017 − appearing in everything from robots to fridges − Google has fired back with expansion plans for its own voice-activated mouthpiece, Google Assistant. The tech giant has announced that its chatty personal assistant, which first appeared on Google's Pixel smartphone range, is headed to various Android TV media players, multiple in-car "infotainment" systems, as well as the next generation of Android Wear smartwatches. Google revealed in a blog post that the technology, which also resides in the Alphabet subsidiary's Amazon Echo rival, Google Home, will launch on Android TV streaming devices in the US "in the coming months." The tech's addition will allow users to control playback, find streaming content on Netflix, Amazon Video and other services, and answer questions via internet searches, all with simple voice commands. Nvidia's updated Shield TV will be among the first devices to introduce the tech to television sets, with other Android Marshmallow and Nougat players − such as Sharp Aquos, Sony Bravia and Xiaomi Mi Box − also mentioned. The blog post also touched on the tech's future on smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0 software, as well as its inclusion in car systems from manufacturers such as Daimler and Hyundai. The latter car maker detailed how its Blue Link software will function alongside Google Assistant at the Las Vegas show, talking up its connected car features, such as remotely locking doors and sounding the horn. That'll teach passers-by. While Google Assistant has found its way to many through the Allo messaging app, smart home enthusiasts in the UK are still waiting for Google to announce a European release date for the Google Home smart speaker. The Amazon Echo rival launched in the US on 4 November, but aside from importing it from US websites, the well-received device has yet reach other markets.

Music-sharing website which could be bought by Google – here’s what we know The music site could be snapped up by Google after talks with Spotify fell through By Laura Burnip 5th January 2017, 4:56 pm Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments SOUNDCLOUD is rumoured to be in takeover talks with Google – just weeks after a possible deal with Spotify fell through. But what is the streaming site, how much is it worth and how is it different from other sites? Here’s what we know… Alamy 6 The streaming site was a challenger to MySpace back in the early days of music streaming What is Soundcloud? The Berlin-based site was launched in 2007 as a social media network for musicians to record, upload and share their work with others. It soon became a way of musicians distributing their work to listeners – challenging MySpace as the dominant platform because of its flexibility. Artists including Sonic Youth, Moby and Beck turned to SoundCloud to release new tracks, with no file-size limit. Reuters 6 Founder Alexander Ljung wanted to create a platform which allowed artists to interact with listeners But SoundCloud had no deals set up with the major music companies, causing problems because copyrighted material kept being uploaded onto the site and used in remixes. Some feared a massive copyright infringement lawsuit was just around the corner, and striking up the necessary deals was a slow process. The company eventually managed to strike up a deal with the Warner Music Group in November 2014, followed by Merlin in 2015, Universal Music Group and Sony Music in 2016. In September, after posting subsequent losses, the company was revealed to have boosted its top line revenues by 43% in just one year, reported digitalmusicnews. Alamy 6 Beck was among the early proponents of SoundCloud, uploading his work through the streaming site Is SoundCloud free? The original site was completely free, but later launched Soundcloud Go, its premium subscription service in 2016. At £9.99 a month, it allows users to listen offline and ad-free with access to more tracks than the free version. Following the various deals with the big music companies, more and more big name artists have been uploading tracks to the site. Getty Images 6 Some of the site’s 175million users at SoundCloud Go’s official launch party in Berlin in 2016 How much is SoundCloud worth? The site has previously been valued at between $700m and $1billion, but the potential Google deal is said to be worth $500m. At the end of last year, Spotify was reported to be interested in buying SoundCloud, but the companies were unable to agree on a price. According to itechpost, SoundCloud lowered its price tag from $1b during takeover negotiations with Spotify. TechCrunch reported that the deal fell through because of the potential “licensing headache” of negotiating with music labels. Alamy 6 Artists such as Moby were followed to the site by stars like Justin Bieber and Kanye West after it struck up deals with the big music companies How is SoundCloud different from Spotify? The sharing site has more than 130million tracks on offer – far more than Spotify’s 30m. Many of these are DJ mixes, remixes and podcasts which are exclusive to SoundCloud and can’t be found anywhere else. So users can create playlists of amateur musicians, podcasts and big name artists – as well as being able to comment on them and share feedback. But Business Insider estimated last year that the site only had around 15million songs which you couldn’t get on the free version. However since then, the site appears to have expanded its SoundCloud Go offering, including hundreds of tracks by big names such as Kanye West. 6 The platform allows users to create playlists of established artists, remixes and unknown acts How many people are on SoundCloud? The site has more users than any other streaming service, with more than 175million users to date. Spotify has around 100million, of which around a third are paid users – but has to pay 70% of its revenue to record labels. While it isn’t known how many users have signed up to SoundCloud Go, industry experts estimate it is only around 250,000, according to Bloomberg.

Home Categories Domain Sales Domain Services Domain Registrars Domain Parking Expired Domains We Get It Policy & Law Uncategorized Podcasts About Advertise Disclosures Facebook Google+ RSS Twitter YouTube Domain Name Wire | Domain Name News & Views Domain Name Industry News and Views Featured Domains When the domain you need is taken... A threat to the importance of domain names by Andrew Allemann — January 5, 2017 Uncategorized 47 Comments Domain names face a number of threats, including AI personal assistants. Our industry seems to spend a lot of energy battling between the relative value of old top level domain names versus new ones. It doesn’t spend enough time paying attention to the threats that the domain industry faces as a whole. As I explained on the DNW Predictions podcast last week, one of these possible threats is starting to appear. A lot of people have said that voice control is a threat to domain names. I disagree. The idea of people telling their web browser where to go via voice does not eliminate the need for navigational signposts like domain names. Yet, we are now inviting a new way of getting information and ordering goods directly into our living room: Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home and the like. We also have AI-powered personal assistants like Google Assistant and Siri. Yes, these can use voice. But what makes these different than just using your voice to nagivate is that they anticipate your needs and act as the gatekeeper. So while voice is not a threat to domain names in and of itself, AI-powered assistants are. If a personal assistant anticipates your needs then you don’t need to go to your browser to find the information you were going to look for. This includes both simple information requests and commerce transactions. That’s bad for domain names. Consider your personal assistant informing you: “Your mom’s birthday is in four weeks. May I suggest you order flowers? Say yes to place an order for a dozen flowers, to be delivered on X date, for $29.95”. Think about the searches and website visits this removes from the ecosystem. An e-commerce transaction can occur without the user ever viewing or thinking about the web. In many ways, Amazon Echo is a new web browser, too. We ask it questions that we’d normally type on our phone. No domain names and no websites are visible to the user. It’s unclear how many people own a standalone device like the Echo, but Amazon’s sales over the holidays exceeded even its own expectations, as evidenced by its stockout. And these devices can be built into your phone, such as Google Assistant and Siri, without the need for a separate device. I think the threat is real. This services don’t eliminate the need for domain names, but they can reduce the value of having a high-quality one. I hope the domain industry can come together as one rather than fighting about why one name is better than another. There are good reasons that businesses should own their own domain name rather than rely on gatekeepers like Google, Amazon and Facebook. As Matt Mullenweg, creator of WordPress, told me in DNW podcast #91 this year, it’s more important than ever for people to own their own domain and web presence. But I fear that the utility of the Amazon Echo and personal assistants will make domain names less and less relevant. We might start seeing some of the effects of this in 2017. We can sit around and gripe about gatekeepers, or we can rally together to spread a message about the importance of not relying solely on the gatekeepers. Call it an independence movement; explaining to people how owning their own domain name frees them from tyranny. Of course, anything we can do to bring domain names into the ecosystem of the ease-of-use of AI assistants will also help.

Unquestionably, AI, machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) will gradually erode the need to access information and/or services via websites and direct navigation. Registries and registrars need to champion this initiative, imho. Cheers, Reply John says January 12, 2017 at 11:49 am I dont agree that Amazon echo and the like will erode the need for domain names. Dont know about anyone else, but when im ordering flowers I like to shop around for the best price and best looking flowers I can find. I wouldnt just order because Amazon or google suggest a particular one. Reply Chad Folk says January 5, 2017 at 1:15 pm If your looking to build an end user driven company, then yes, those access and communications points will come into play more then others. If your building a business on a URL using advanced technology, new business models and connected networks, VNOC, then the url and its utility and utilization capabilities are still in the beginning stages and can ride with the value creation of AI. Embracing tech will rarely disrupt online real estate values if utilized and leveraged correctly.. Reply Jothan Frakes says January 5, 2017 at 1:20 pm Andrew we will certainly be talking about this at NamesCon in a few weeks. There are a number of other new technologies that will grow domain name use and innovation as well as those where we might see some like AI/IA bypass it, so I think there will be churn but not destruction. Fundamentally, DNS and Domain Names play a role not unlike ‘speed dial’ for the majority of users, so that they don’t need to use IP addresses or remember those complicated 4 numbers of an IPv4 address, and IPv6 addresses are far more complex and challenging to remember, so domain name shortcuts will always have a place. And that sets aside a number of resilience/security and failover systems as well as numerous other benefits. I look at IoT using DNS transport for state/storage and the fundamental concept of our use of domain names as continuing to hold a future of utility and benefit for domain names. And never underestimate the sheer staying power of email. I have had my personal domain name jothan.com since 1995 and I don’t see where I’d replace it with an Echo. With CES this week there are a number of technologies that are poised to inspire thoughts of disruption of the domain name space, and I think you make some valid points, but we had similar concerns with apps being disruptive a few years ago and it really is not manifesting in the way that has demonstrated any impact. I don’t necessarily disagree with the notion of “assistants” having potential to disrupt, but there are a number of things that need to play out first. Like for one, how much listening exactly is happening. Law Enforcement ‘Listening’ / Privacy Concerns Yesterday, there were a large number of articles about potential Law Enforcement uses for a device that is always listening. http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/alexa-witness-murder-prosecutors-seek-amazon-echo-data-44437461 By today, (likely for CES) there has been some whitewashing of those articles (Kudos to Amazon’s press team for leaping on this) http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/01/05/alexa-is-listening-but-amazon-values-privacy-and-gives-you-control/&refURL=https://news.google.com/&referrer=https://news.google.com/ Porn and Redirection Alexa also carries forward the domain name industry’s “Whitehouse.com effect”, where a toddler launched porn from a request to play a song: https://youtu.be/epyWW2e43UU While you may be correct about the ultimate fate of domain names, I suspect that the horizon of that demise may be fairly far vs being imminent. Reply Kevin says January 5, 2017 at 1:26 pm This notation by you on your DNW 2017 Predictions Podcast was the one that stood out to me the most. I totally agree with all of what you noted above as something that not only can affect domain names, but also online retailing. If one uses Amazon’s Echo, Google Home etc., to order flowers or anything easily ship-able, seems it would be logical for Amazon or Google to (eventually?) use their own goods or suppliers to fulfill those orders, totally bypassing all other retailers. This could lead back to that ‘walled garden’ effect, and perhaps give them a monopoly, on certain ‘easy to order from anywhere’ items. Great maybe for convenience and simplicity of life, but a disaster coming for small online businesses, and for a customers’ choice of retailer options in the future. Reply Andrew Allemann says January 5, 2017 at 7:53 pm Also think about all of those Amazon Dash buttons people have now. Click a physical button to order a product online. Reply EM @QUE.COM says January 10, 2017 at 5:00 pm I’ve seen this happening when I was approached by group of Amazon sellers. I help them setup with FB for their products, when I told them to get a domain name nobody’s interested. They not even bother to spend $9. They use gmail.com to conduct business. Maybe a few 10% of them have their own domain name. But those sellers making thousands a week not even bother getting one now or in the future. Amazon doesn’t allow to include any domain name in any insert, unless you own the product brand (trademarks). And searching stay within Amazon, similar to FB a closed network. Using Amazon Echo or Google Assistance, the domain name is become an optional tool. 🙁 Oh well. Reply R P says January 5, 2017 at 1:43 pm If you are investing in domains that have a purpose than AI will most likely adapt to it, just like SEO and PPC did. Exact match keyword domains of high value products/services, short .coms LLL.com NNN.com, etc will most likely not go down in value just for collectibility purposes alone. Domains have value for advertising purposes and that will never go away. The search aspect came after the advertising aspect. I started buying domains in 1999 for their advertising value, not for algorithmic search engine value. If you can advertise the domain on the radio or TV and consumers have a high chance of remembering it than the domain clearly has value. Reply Gene says January 5, 2017 at 2:44 pm Excellent point about brand value Reply EM @QUE.COM says January 10, 2017 at 5:03 pm Keep in mind, in AI world your advertising to radio or TV doesn’t matter. Your contents need to be in Google, FB or Amazon depending on what AI you use. Reply Andrea Paladini says January 5, 2017 at 1:52 pm IMHO Voice Computing will not reduce the value of having high-quality domains. Direct navigation and websites will always be at the core of the web experience. Monopolistic positions in Voice Computing by some companies/gatekeepers could be a threat to domains, but the multiplication of players and a fierce but fair competition in the voice business should avoid that. Maybe governments should also better enforce antitrust and anti-monopolistic actions, that started with browsers longtime ago but it should also include online advertising, search and voice computing … Anyway I think that many people will prefer to access independently from those gatekeepers, freeing themselves from the tyranny of third parties, as you said. 🙂 Reply Scott says January 5, 2017 at 3:16 pm “Anyway I think that many people will prefer to access independently from those gatekeepers, freeing themselves from the tyranny of third parties…” Unfortunately, 90% of the masses have been spoon-fed a steady diet of 3rd party gatekeepers and will find it very difficult to wean themselves from the respective teats of those masters. Those that don’t navigate directly are unlikely to change in that direction and will likely continue to ride the tide of the new emerging technologies… Cheers, Reply Andrew Allemann says January 5, 2017 at 8:01 pm I don’t think it’s fair to say they’ve been spoon fed. These gatekeepers provide a valuable service. There’s a reason I re-order stuff through my Echo. It’s very convenient. Reply Andrea Paladini says January 5, 2017 at 3:22 pm P.S. Voice Computing is basically controlling many devices with your voice, it’s about the interaction between humans and machines with the most natural of tools, your voice. I don’t think that will tarnish or reduce the branding and advertising value and power of quality domains. 🙂 Reply Josh says January 5, 2017 at 2:13 pm No AI will search for what most adults search for most nights 😉 And if they did you’d have to find a way to kill your AI assistant when replacing lol Reply John says January 5, 2017 at 2:36 pm This technology can only serve limited purposes. The AI assistant can’t do your participation for you in a social medium such as a discussion forum, for instance. You may be able to navigate to “ExampleForum.com” by voice or AI, but you still have to engage with the site and know where you are going to begin with. And even for the purpose of shopping, what about comparison shopping, and searching to find a good deal. How many people are going to content to take the first thing their AI assistant pops up? Who shops that way except extremely careless people? Reply Andrew Allemann says January 5, 2017 at 8:02 pm It depends on what you’re buying the the convenience of who is selling it. Reply Mark Thorpe says January 5, 2017 at 4:30 pm Domains are like hardware and part of the Internet backbone. You cannot just take domain names out of the Internet equation. Apps, Social Media, AI assistants are like software, built on top of the Internet hardware. Domains will always have a purpose and will adapt accordingly, like they have all along. Domain extensions that will survive any competition IMO are as follows: .Com .Web .Net .Org .Co Reply Gene says January 5, 2017 at 4:36 pm Any threat to domain names – usage or valuations – would impact names that don’t pass the ‘radio test’: Which, in light of these A.I. technologies that are upon us, has become more important than ever before when it comes to assessing a domain name’s worth. Reply EM @QUE.COM says January 10, 2017 at 5:06 pm Excellent point. Reply Andrew Allemann says January 5, 2017 at 5:29 pm I’m not arguing that domain names will go away. I’m arguing that there usage could decline. We are talking about a change in how people interact with the net, which will have a profound impact on the web as we know it. I’m sure this change is keeping people at google up at night. Reply R P says January 5, 2017 at 6:09 pm Google knew this day would come long ago. As a digital marketer the trend away from PPC/SEO traffic as growth driver and towards email/social interaction with your existing customers (continual, free branding) happened many years ago. What domain name you use when emailing your customer is branding to some degree (as well as trust), especially when you are dealing with millions of customers/email addresses. Email isn’t going anywhere. A business model built around Google, and SEO in particular, does not necessarily have solid long term footing. A website is a business in itself. Too many website owners are simply not good businessman IMO. A good domain provides a key advertising/marketing advantage and always will. Reply Brawn says January 5, 2017 at 5:50 pm AI will make shot domains worth less. Voice recognition can understand longer words and therefore longer domains more often. Many billions have been spent to get it to the point where it is now, so unless there is a huge breakthrough this is where it’s heading. NASA is responsible for most of the advancements made so far in VR. Reply Andrea Paladini says January 6, 2017 at 6:02 pm Microsoft is investing a lot as well in voice recognition, which is the entry key of the huge voice computing business. IMHO voice computing has the potential to become at least as big as cloud computing. That’s why Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc are all massively investing on it … Reply Join Domains says January 5, 2017 at 7:08 pm Damn, never had an offer on SmartVoiceControl …….ummm Reply Logan Flatt says January 10, 2017 at 2:14 pm Why use your voice at all? We’ll have cognitive computing soon enough and somebody will want CognitiveControl dot com and CognitiveCommand dot com. That is, if domain names are even relevant by then, which I question. 🙁 Reply Frank Schilling says January 5, 2017 at 10:01 pm I love echo and think Amazon’s “new browser” only increases searches. You’ll still refine those searches through a visual browser on the Web. And you’re only one lousy echo-facilitated bunch of roses away from going back to traditional visual browser search and comparative analysis. Google actually becomes the domain owner’s friend because the new battle of competing audio assistants by Apple and Amazon keeps Google turning back better results and better domain names will cut through the clutter and become more important than ever. “Siri, send an email to Malibu.Flowers and tell them some of the roses were dead” ((You’ll need a domain name to send that email, Frank)) .. If there is any threat to domain names it’s that Echo will drive more consumers to Amazon and regular “stores” die. Lead-gen goes away or evolves (less names needed there). Certain categories of product delivery/fulfillment get handled exclusively through Amazon (like toilet paper and bottled water today). But I think overall growth (in searches, in users) still eclipses any falloff brought by the voice revolution and just like video killed the radio star, goggles and glasses and holograms will trump voice. Speaking of Trump, he or his successor will probably break up Amazon. At some point they just get too big and do it too well. Names still don’t go away because of the need for email which has 95% global penetration, which is the cornerstone of verification systems, which is in every nation, isn;t owned by any single co — and which doesn’t work without a domain.. I’m always scared of the boogeyman when it’s dark out but in our business, this isn’t him. The inertia towards names is still too strong and it’s too difficult for any one platform to viably dis-intermediate websites and email on a global scale. That’s my penny and a half. Reply Mark Thorpe says January 6, 2017 at 12:52 pm Email will always serve a purpose, but it has and will have competition from mobile phone text messaging. I think you will see more and more important information being verified and replied to, via mobile phone text messaging and QR codes. Text messaging has already had an impact on domain names, with people typing in shorter words and acronyms more than ever. This has influenced the buying of short and acronym domain names. The question is, are domain names going to decline in use or value? NO! Domains are just going to be a lot more mobile going forward. Domain names, especially .Com’s, will become even more important to businesses in the future and they will continue to increase in value. Supply/demand is coming into play now for .Com’s. Less supply and more demand. It’s a good time to be a domain name owner, especially if you own .Com names. Reply Andrea Paladini says January 6, 2017 at 6:13 pm Agree on almost all points with Frank, but IMHO goggles and glasses and holograms will not trump voice computing, simply because they are complementary, so I think they will coexist. Same reasons why desktop will continue to be widely used, coexisting with mobile devices. Different technologies will coexist, that idea of some innovation destroying any other tool is a baseless mirage … 🙂 Reply Cate Colgan says January 10, 2017 at 2:03 pm I’ll take your penny and a half in bitcoin please Frank? 🙂 Reply John says January 6, 2017 at 11:14 am I have to agree with a lot of what Frank said there, and I have also posted recently about what I referred to as the “monolithic” nature of email. Isn’t Google itself already the biggest enemy of domain names to begin with? Hasn’t Google already been doing everything it (they) can to obliterate the importance of domain names because domain names threaten their wealth, power and dominance? Reply Joe Alagna says January 6, 2017 at 2:04 pm I think Andrew’s points should be taken seriously by our industry. He’s not saying that domains will go away. His point is that we face the chance of reduced importance (which could certainly affect the growth we’ve enjoyed for 20 years). We’re in an industry that has seen fantastic and steady growth each year for 20 years plus. I’m bearish on domains but we drink our own cool-aid if we believe that disruption is not possible. People use convenience. When it becomes more convenient for someone to use, remember, say, or point to a destination with some other device than a domain name, then it is possible that domain names can become less important. Domain names are simply an easy pointer to a number (IP Address). If someone comes up with an easier method to reach a number, who knows? Certainly we should be discussing these possibilities within the industry (rather than arguing about traditional and new domains). Two years ago, I had similar thoughts about QR Codes. I’m no fan of them and I believe that URLs are way more valuable and important. I dedicated a whole blog to it (http://domainsarebetter.com/). So far, it’s been pretty much left alone. But we’re very close to OS driven QR/BAR code readers. They will work and they are faster than typing in URLs. That’s just one possibility and doesn’t even consider AI. (By the way, I registered the domain, “VoiceBased.com” in the year 2000). With all their faults, the industry behind QR codes makes great strides in other important industries. For example, read this: https://www.wired.com/2016/07/qr-codes-gmo-labeling-actually-great-idea/. The US Govt. recently required QR codes on GMO foods. Who did that?… The bar code industry lobbying the food industry. Anyway, I think Andrew’s point should be taken seriously and discussed within our industry. No business is immune to disruption today. Reply Nick says January 6, 2017 at 2:04 pm Maybe it’s cause I’m not surrounded by rich people, but that will never happen with anyone I know. I do not know 1 person that would say , sure send them flowers I don’t care about knowing the price. The people I know will not only search for the best deal, but also enter a coupon code for it. Reply Joe Alagna says January 6, 2017 at 2:54 pm Darn it, I meant “Bullish on domain names” not “Bearish” Thanks, Joe Reply Andrea Paladini says January 6, 2017 at 6:56 pm Btw, The Economist just published a very interesting article about Voice Computing, which is also the greatest breakthrough of CES 2017, currently live in Las Vegas. Here is the article: http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21713836-casting-magic-spell-it-lets-people-control-world-through-words-alone-how-voice Reply Adrian says January 8, 2017 at 1:48 am Now if only there was an association that was looking out for the Domain Name Industry and speaking publically about these things… oh wait… http://www.thedna.org Reply logixca says January 9, 2017 at 11:56 am In my view, domain names adds to the credibility of the overall business storyline and failing to refer to it (namely through AI) becomes one more missed opportunity to have it have a shot at earning more mindshare. At my registry, http:://mbnx.com/ I’ve had hundreds of new domain name extensions added but AI is moving in so fast, I’m not sure people will have enough time to learn about the “.club” , “voyage” and “.tips” suffixes to actually “miss them” (because they probably won’t even know they exist). As such, AI could be moving in so fast that what’s known as the expansion phase of the domain names suffixes could basically miss its target of making the domain names ecosystem more prevalent and useful, to more people. So yes, we need to talk about this particular subject and thanks for bringing it up. Reply Paul Stahura says January 10, 2017 at 1:21 pm Domain names are 1) globally unique 2) defined by the registrant, 3) easily used by humans 4) entrenched and integral to the world economy. In other words: 1) there is only one “amazon.com”. When one uses a domain name (for example, by typing it in a browser, or clicking on a link), it will “go to” one and only one website worldwide. amazon.com goes to the same website whether or not you are in China, the UK or the South Africa. It does *not* “go to” a porn website in china and an e-commerce site in the US. It does not need to be disambiguated with a question such as “which amazon.com do you mean? the porn one, the search one, the commerce one, the rainforest one?”. Its born pre-disambiguated. 2) That “place” it “goes to” is defined by the registrant. It is *not* defined by whoever made your laptop or cell phone, or the operating system on that device, or by the web-browser maker, or what someone (or machine) thinks society’s definition of the word “amazon” is, or defined by anyone else. Its defined by one and only one party: the registrant. Not only does it go to the “place” defined by the registrant, but what is at that “place” (the content there) is also defined by the registrant. 3) Humans do not use numbers, or lengthy descriptions to refer to something, we use names. We uses names, especially when the names are well-defined. When they are ambiguous and not well defined, then we fall back to using one or multiple descriptive words, and when that does not suffice we used descriptions. Numbers suck because they do not have much meaning, and they are hard for humans to remember. 4) The domain name system is very entrenched… its built into the law in nearly all countries of the world. Trademarks, etc. The DNS is very hard to dislodge. This has been proven, time and again over 30 years. No other alternative has been able to dislodge it, though many have tried. Not keywords, not real names, not search, not icons for phone apps, not even alternative roots not by the UN or by various governments. When it comes to voice AIs like Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Echo/Alexa, Google’s Assistant/Home, and the like, I believe they’ll make domain names more prominent, not less. Why? First off, one speaks to these devices. Domain names are spoken words that humans can remember and are meaningful. Check. Second, the definition of the the domain name is specified by the registrant. Not by Apple, Amazon or Google. Normal words do not have that property. If I say “buy Tide”, Siri may interpret that one way, and Alexa, another. “Tide” is also what happens to the ocean. There are different interpretations to the word “buy” too. What would happen if Sun Products (the maker of “Surf” detergent), made a deal with Amazon, so that when someone said “buy Tide”, Amazon sold the Surf brand instead? Or what if Amazon pre-empts that Tide purchase with their own Amazon branded detergent? Saying “Buy Tide” to Siri, would have a different result compared saying “buy Tide” to Google? Domain names solve that problem. As an example, “tide.buy” would be defined by the registrant of that domain name. The registrant specifies what it is that Siri, Alexa, or Google’s Assistant would do (and any others that pop up – just like there are different browsers from Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc). If you are selling Tide, are you going to trust all these services to do the right thing, or are you going to tell your potential customers “just say ‘tide.buy’ to whatever device you have in your kitchen”. Third, domains are globally unique. True, when someone types (a domain name), its very specific, and when one speaks (a domain name) its ambiguous (did you say “beer” or “bear” or “bare” or “bar” for example), but these devices have that problem (and they will get better and better at it) whether or not one is speaking a domain name or not a domain name. At least domain names confine the problem to determining what you said, not to determining what to do. Hearing “dot”, Siri’s search-space is confined to the registered domain names that have a “voice” (lets call it, as opposed to a MX or A record) entry in the DNS, as opposed to any mix of words and sounds that can be possibly uttered by a human. Fourth, Domain names are not going away. If a naming system is to be used with these AI’s, and we think this new use for domain names is inevitable, there is no alternative to the DNS. The entire purpose of domain names is to tell computers what we humans mean. We envision these AIs will work nearly the same as the web works now. step 1: invoke a registrant-defined name: on the web, this means typing it into a browser, or clicking on a link. In the voice world, it means speaking the domain name. step 2: you are brought to a “place” that outputs content, specified by the registrant. In the web case, its text and/or pictures, in the AI case its the AI speaking and/or it taking an action. step 3: depending on the content, you interact with the “place”. The place is the same even though you may use different browsers. In the web case, if the content is a form, you fill in the form elements and click submit. In the AI case, it asks you questions (the text in the form) and you answer them (the form fields you fill in). The purpose of search is to get you to invoke a registrant-defined name, unless the search engine is extremely confident regarding what you mean (for example, if you type “what is the weather” or “who is the 14th president” into Google), in which case it will answer your query, AND output a list of domain names. For these reasons, I believe domain names will become more and more relevant in the future with AIs, not less. One more thing. Donuts has built a prototype Alexa-Dash lovechild. Dash is that Amazon service whereby you press a button when you are low on Tide, and a box of Tide shows up at your house later that day. Our lovechild does the same thing without the button. Just say a domain, for example “tide.buy” to Alexa. Alexa replies “Do you want to buy a box of Tide?” (configurable by the registrant – could also just do it) , you say “yes”. Done. A box of Tide shows up on your door stoop. Its Dash without the hardware using domain names with the action defined by the registrant. Reply Andrew Allemann says January 10, 2017 at 1:55 pm Paul, thanks for providing your thoughts. Regarding the Alexa-Dash prototype, that sounds cool. How is it different from telling Alexa “reorder Tide”? It it because the user defines the action to be taken with the domain name? Reply Paul Stahura says January 10, 2017 at 4:31 pm the registrant decides the action (or the conversation) and its AI/device-independent. That action would be the same no matter what the AI/device is. Reply Paul Stahura says January 10, 2017 at 4:41 pm you’d “program” your Alexa/Siri/Assistant action/conversation at your registrar, the same as you would build a html form/page at your domain name now. Reply Cate Colgan says January 10, 2017 at 2:07 pm Love it Paul! Wait I think I hear my doorbell now – Tides here! Reply Joe Alagna says January 10, 2017 at 2:24 pm Hi Paul, The Donuts dash deal sounds awesome. Where is a link to something about that? Thx, Joe Reply Paul Stahura says January 10, 2017 at 4:33 pm its in prototype, not read for prime time. the “bare.buy” vs “bear.buy” problem is one issue (that i mentioned). That problem does not exists when typing domains. Reply Paul Stahura says January 10, 2017 at 4:37 pm related: due to this “homonym” problem (and speaking is easier than typing), I agree (with Brawn above) longer domain names are not a problem, actually a benefit. Reply Cate Colgan says January 10, 2017 at 2:10 pm I’m going to simplify this for myself by referring to the radio test as far as names/domains go – I’ve been saying that for a long time now that voice activation is just that but in reverse 🙂 can you hear me/name now 🙂 Reply The demand for domains is exploding says January 11, 2017 at 4:43 pm I think you’re mistaken Andrew, domains will actually increase in importance in an AI led world. People want options, not everyone eats at McDonalds you know. I wrote a blog post outlining some of the reasons, please take a look.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Home Entertainment Nvidia Shield Android TV is the first to offer Google Assistant support Home Entertainment Nvidia Shield Android TV is the first to offer Google Assistant support By Sohil Nikam - Jan 5, 2017 The Nvidia Shield concept has again branched out into the Android TV sphere. A new version of the product has just been unveiled at CES, with its main selling point being support for Google Assistant. Although we know that it will cost $199, there’s still no word on what its release date is. Needless to say that the Nvidia Shield is the first Android TV device to feature Google Assistant integration. The service is right now only accessible via Pixel phones, Google Home speakers and the Allo app. Apart from acting as a digital assistant, it can even be directed to complete certain tasks, like launching videos, booking movie tickets and more. Nvidia has also showcased a microphone accessory dubbed Spot which can be placed around the house for remotely issuing commands to Assistant. One such microphone will cost $50, and it’s unclear at the moment whether a unit will come bundled with the Android TV or not. Also Read: Nvidia launches ultra-powerful new GeForce GTX 1080 and 1070 GPUs The specifications of the Shield Android TV remain a secret for now, but we do know that it will support 4K HDR visuals. We suppose the company is holding off on revealing them to keep the curiosity levels up for when the device will actually be released in the market. Like we said, the Nvidia Shield Android TV has been priced by its makers at $199. Let us now wait and watch when the company decides to make it available for purchase. Interested parties can place their pre-orders on Nvidia’s official website.

Oh, they're still mentioning games, and they include native Android versions of Tomb Raider and The Witness (the mobile version lives!) as coming to the platform. And the in-home PC game streaming is getting expanded with support for Steam Big Picture, meaning this could actually serve as a replacement for the Steam Link, as well. But the processor is still the Tegra X1 with 3 GB of RAM, same as the original released in 2015. In fact, Nvidia's press release keeps calling this a streamer, and not a game console. It's certainly a capable device still – more than capable of 4K HDR video, and it runs games quite well – but the hardware upgrades are a bit more subtle, yet intriguing in terms of software. Google Assistant support is coming to the Nvidia Shield TV, and you can use a hands-free, always-on microphone in the redesigne Shield controller to communicate your various voice requests. While the Shield TV is a TV device, USB soundcards and DACs are supported, so you could use this as a replacement for the Google Home speaker by providing a USB soundcard and your own powered speakers, potentially. Nvidia will sell a device called the Shield Spot that's similar to the Amazon Echo Dot for $49.99 that will interface with the Shield TV through your wi-fi network to extend Google Assistant throughout your home. The Google Assistant is also coming to existing Shield TV models, so if you wanted to get into Google Home without investing in the standalone speaker, this might be the way to go if you already have the Shield TV. I do, and while I'm currently in the Amazon Echo ecosystem, I use Google Play Music and would be willing to switch over just to voice control my music and not pay $3.99 per month for the Echo-only Amazon Music subscription out of principle, and because the Google Assistant seems to have some advantages over Amazon's Alexa assistant. The new Shield TV will also have SmartThings hub support, so this could be a handy way to get started with voice controlling your lighting. It's a first-world problem, but I love my current Lifx bulb. The problem with smart home technology is that you have to invest in a hub and get locked in to some products or go with the few options that connect directly to wi-fi like Lifx or TP-Link's products do. The integrated hub gives you some extra choice. As far as content and functionality goes, the current Shield TV is better than the Apple TV. The Apple TV is superior as far as controlling it goes, and it's why I use it over the Shield TV to a large degree. But it's hard to recommend the Apple TV based on content. The Shield TV is also getting native Amazon Video support, and the 4K HDR support is important for folks invested in that technology. Plus, the Shield TV's getting better as a server device. It can run Plex Media Server and is remarkably more capable than even many dedicated NAS devices, especially for the cost. And now it can serve as a capable, always-on smart home hub. Apple TV has HomeKit support, but no always-listening assistant option yet. I could see Apple going that route very soon, because they are falling well, well behind the competition. The interesting thing about all this is how gaming is slowly being taken away from the focus of this, and perhaps other streamer-type devices. I've written a lot about my hopes for games on streamers, and I still want to believe that maybe they'll be involved at some pont. But Apple TV game sales have not been appetizing. And while Nvidia's still pushing native Shield content along with the streaming options, it's quite clear that they want to sell the Shield TV not just as a streamer that can play games, but a powerful piece of hardware that can do everything a person could desire from a plugged-in device. The enhanced Shield TV is up for preorder now at Nvidia's site, Best Buy, and Amazon. Prices remain the same as before: $199 for the 16 GB Shield TV, though it now comes with the remote along with the console and redesigned controller. It boasts 60 hours of gaming battery life, along with the always-on mic and an IR blaster for control of entertainment devices. The $299 Shield TV Pro comes with the remote, new controller, and 500 GB of storage, though the 16 GB can be expanded through USB drives (the micro-SD slot appears to have been removed). January 16th is the expected ship date on Amazon for the new Shield TV and controller. Hi-Rez Reveals 'Smite Rivals', Their Take on 'Clash Royale' 'Crowntakers' Gets Universal Update, iPhone Owners Can Now Join in the Fun jabbasoft Not sure how this really competes $/$ with an Xbox One S? Maybe I've missed the point/concept.. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp There's a lot of stuff in Android (particularly if you get into sideloading) that don't exist on other set top boxes / consoles. My 1st gen Shield is how I primarily watch things on my TV. The games are just kind of a weird value add for me, as it's not like I'm sitting around going wild over Shield games instead of playing my PC/PS4/ etc. (Just like the Apple TV.) IainsTheName If you love stealing content, then these boxes (and much cheaper alternatives) are brilliant for it. If you enjoy paying people for their work, an Xbox One S would do you better. As for why Nvidia has dropped the gaming console description from this, my best guess is the Nintendo Switch. Orionsangel That controller though, WTF! Shield TV though is definitely the best Android TV on the Market. You can play a lot of games on it. Even sideloaded games that they don't tell you about, like Bully https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z6hXYScwz8 PHUCKO I got one the first gen to use KODI thinking it would do so more competently than a fire stick. I later got a fire stick to take on vacation and it works just as well. The fire stick is the best bang for the buck if you all need is a "KODI box".

By Conner Forrest | January 5, 2017, 8:15 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: ASUS The second Google Tango-powered smartphone has officially been unveiled as the ASUS ZenFone AR, which the company debuted alongside the ZenFone 3 Zoom at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The ZenFone AR is the first smartphone that supports both the Tango augmented reality (AR) technology and Google's Daydream virtual reality (VR) technology, according to a press release. The first phone to support Tango itself was the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, announced in late 2016. For those unfamiliar, Tango helps to map a user's position in their physical environment, so that developers can build AR experiences relative to that particular environment, the release said. And Daydream supports the use of VR apps with the Google Daydream headset. SEE: CES 2017 Special Coverage (CNET) | CES 2017 (TechRepublic) | CES 2017: The Big Trends for Business (ZDNet) To qualify for use with Google's Tango, a device must have specific sensors and software that allow it to interpret the world around it. "Tango adds three new abilities to ZenFone AR: motion tracking, depth perception and area learning. Through these capabilities, Zenfone AR can detect how far it is away from a floor, wall or an object and understand where it is moving in three-dimensional space," the release said.

It's screen makes it a good option for use within the Daydream VR headset, as it adds to the immersiveness of VR apps, the release said. ASUS also announced the ZenFone 3 Zoom, a smartphone designed for photography with long battery life. The 5.5-inch smartphone has a 5000mAh packed into a 7.9mm chassis, making it the world's thinnest phone to use such a battery, the release said. Much like the iPhone 7, the ZenFone 3 Zoom utilizes a dual camera setup. According to the release it has a 12MP, f/1.7-aperture, 25mm wide-angle main lens, along with a dedicated 12MP, 56mm camera for instant 2.3X optical zoom. It also includes a portrait mode for depth-of-field shots with blurred backgrounds. The phone supports RAW files and can record 4K video. In terms of battery life, the ZenFone 3 Zoom claims 40 days of standby power on 4G, and it also can be used as a power bank to charge other devices, the release said. The ASUS ZenFone AR will be available in Q2 2017, while the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom will be available in February. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers At CES 2017, ASUS announced the new ZenFone AR, which offers support for both Google's Tango AR and Daydream VR technology. The ZenFone AR is the second phone to offer support for Tango, providing 3D mapping capabilities for use in AR apps. The ZenFone 3 Zoom is geared toward photography with a dual camera setup and support for RAW file format. Click here to subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter.

We’ve walked the show floor to bring you the most interesting smart home devices we could find at CES 2017. Lenovo Smart Assistant Pocket-lint Lenovo has announced a smart speaker powered by Amazon’s Alexa cloud-based voice services, offering an alternative to Amazon's Echo speaker. For those looking for high-quality audio, there's even a special edition Harman Kardon version. Lenovo Smart Assistant preview: Transformers, Alexa in disguise The Lenovo Smart Assistant will be available from May 2017 for $129.99. The Harman Kardon version will also be available from May, but cost a little more at $179.99. Nvidia Shield Spot Nvidia The new Nvidia Shield TV set-top box offers a whole load of gaming and entertainment potential, but interestingly, it's also a Google hub, offering Google Assistant. The more interesting development from a smart home perspective is the Shield Spot device. Nvidia Shield Spot extends the 4K console's reach through your home You can place the Spots around your house as an extension of your Shield, meaning you can use those Google Home services from other parts of your house, to interact with your Shield TV, use voice control and so on.

Building on the existing “Goals in Google Calendar” feature, released last April, the update incorporates data from Google Fit and Apple Health apps to track your achievements and adapt to them as you go. If you’re not aware, “Goals in Google Calendar” is a little wizard tool that asks what you want to achieve (going to the gym is the usual example) and then finds time in your schedule for appointments. You can set duration and frequency for each work out automatically, and Calendar will send you notifications at the requisite times. Here’s what health data looks like in the updated Google Calendar app. Google With the latest update, health data from wearables and fitness trackers can be viewed right from within the Calendar app, which Google hopes will make it easier to stay on top your goals. The app will even tweak your schedule for you if you fall behind. “Say you set a goal to run at 6:30 every other morning but aren’t actually hitting your stride until 7:15 — Google Calendar has you covered and will adjust accordingly,” said product manager Florian Goerisch in a blog post.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets Pichai bats for cheaper entry-level smartphones Abhishek Law   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, interacting with students during a “chat session” at IIT-Kharagpur on Thursday Google bets big on AI and machine learning Kharagpur, January 5:   Prices of smartphones need to come down to facilitate access by people, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Thursday. Speaking to students during a “chat session” at IIT-Kharagpur, his alma mater, Pichai said the entry-level price of smartphones should be in the range of $30 (approximately ₹2,100). As of date, entry level smartphone prices in India are around ₹4,000-5,000. “I would love to see cheaper smartphones, entry-level smartphones. I think we need to bring the prices down a little more,” he said. Apart from bringing down the price, the other important issue for Google would be ensuring internet connectivity. “And connectivity is extraordinarily important. That is why you have us working on the Wi-Fi project. Some 100-odd railway stations have already been connected,” he maintained. This apart, “Internet Saathi” looks at empowering rural women regarding the use of internet. “We are focussed on bringing internet connectivity,” Pichai maintained. Supporting Digital India The internet major, Pichai said, was also a big supporter of the ‘Digital India’ programme. Partnership with RailTel (for setting up Wi-Fi at stations), Aadhaar, UPI and NPCI were some of the initiatives that the company has taken up or is in the process of setting up. “We are also working on digitising payments and towards having effective partnerships with these public companies,” he further added. According to Pichai, another area of focus was to get Google working in as many regional languages as possible. While Android supports search in regional languages, the next phase would see the internet major finetune its offerings targeting rural dialects. Global competition According to the former IIT-Kharagpur alumnus, the goalposts for India and China are different, especially on the digital front. India will be a global player in digital economy and it will be competitive with any country in the world. “There is a timing issue. We are doing well as a country. We need to stay at it. We need a few more years and we will get to it. I am absolutely confident,” he said. Confident that the “next big” global software companies will be from India in the next five to 10 years, Pichai maintained that Indian companies should aim higher. Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are some of the developed neighbourhood markets. To a specific question on the Indian market being not large enough to invest in technology, the Google CEO pointed out that the market is still developing. It will still take a few more years (to develop). “Digital market is still developing. It is a problem we run into. It’s just a moment in time. Hopefully, Indian companies are also more thoughtful so that when they build stuff, they set their sights a bit bigger. The trend lines are in strong favour,” he added.AI & Machine Learning Google is also “betting big” on Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. “AI and advances in machine learning are the big things in R&D (at Google). Can’t quite tell exactly when, but we are betting on that,” Pichai said. Advances in machine learning, he pointed out, have already come in handy for early detection of retinal diabetes. “It is an early example of the kind of changes that will happen (post) bringing advances in AI and machine learning,” Pichai said.

Thunderous applause greeted the 44-year-old. Clad in denims and a casual shirt, the confident Pichai set the tone of the discussion. “I did have my share of fun,” Pichai said, as he chatted with students at the Tagore Open Air Theatre at the campus. He spoke on meeting wife Anjali (on the campus) and bunking morning classes at IIT-Kharagpur. It came as a big surprise to students when Pichai shared the story of how he would walk right up to the main entrance of the girls’ hostel to meet Anjali. And since those were days when one wasn’t relying on technology, you had to send messages via a messenger. “People would go around the hostel shouting loudly: ‘Anjali, Sundar is here for you’,” he said, as the crowd burst out laughing. The Google CEO then related the story of the chaos he caused by inadvertently “greeting” people at his hostel mess with Hindi expletives. “I had no idea what those words in Hindi meant. And I wasn’t very popular at the mess,” he said, with the students already in splits.On leadership But Pichai was all business the moment he was asked a question about Google and his leadership. For him, teamwork and letting people go and ensuring their success were more important as a leader. “Make sure you have good people. And remove the roadblocks for them. Value teamwork,” was his confident, yet crisp message. The point made, the young crowd, most of whom have idolised him since he became CEO of Google, gave him their signature “like” – a roar of approval. By the end of the 40-minute- long chat session, Pichai showed why he was like any of us or the IITians – he watched cricket and football with his kids; had “embarrassing” grade point averages in the first year (like many engineering students), idolised Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, and looked up to NR Narayana Murthy too. His humble, down-to-earth side had won over the IITians. “He is just like any one of us,” said an over-awed student, heading out to get his share of “goodies” from Google.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Gadgets CES 2017 Day 2: Asus Zenfone AR, BlackBerry ‘Mercury’, Sony 4K OLED TV and more CES 2017 Day 2: Asus Zenfone AR, BlackBerry ‘Mercury’, Sony 4K OLED TV and more CES 2017: Here's everything that happened on the second day of the Consumer Electronics Show. Written by Anuj Bhatia | Las Vegas | Updated: January 9, 2017 2:20 pm CES 2017: Asus Zenfone AR, BlackBerry ‘Mercury’ and Sony 4K OLED TV, here are the highlights from Day 2. It’s Day 2 of CES in Las Vegas, and it has been pretty exciting with announcements and product launches from all the major players. From a smartphone that supports both AR and VR to OLED TVs where the sound comes directly from the screen, here are the highlights from Day 2. Asus bets big on AR, VR Asus made a big jump into the AR and VR territory with its smartphone called the ZenFone AR. After Lenovo’s Phab 2 Pro, the ZenFone AR is the second phone based on Google’s Tango platform. The high-end smartphone, which could be launched in India this year, is also a Daydream-ready device. This means the ZenFone AR is the world’s first smartphone to support both Tango and Daydream platforms. That’s not it all, it even packs in 8GB RAM. While the AR software didn’t run at the demo centre, which was odd, this is an innovative phone from Asus. A visitor tries out the new ZenFone 3 Zoom at Asus’ Zennovation event at CES 2017. Asus also introduced the ZenFone 3 Zoom, which looks like a mid-end smartphone. It is definitely slim, despite the 5,000mAh battery and sports a dual-camera setup. Although I got to spend a few minutes with the ZenFone 3 Zoom, I have to say the camera was able to hold off easily in the demo room. Asus borrowed a couple of camera tricks from the iPhone 7 Plus, which I will be explaining in a separate article. Samsung’s latest Chromebooks run Android apps While Samsung may be making waves in the smartphone world, the company announced two new Chromebooks at CES 2017. Both Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will include high-resolution touchscreens that can rotate 360 degrees; they even runs Android apps. Samsung has announced two new Chromebooks, featuring touchscreen displays. Both notebooks will also come with a stylus. The Chromebook Pro features an Intel M3 processor inside. While it’s hard to say if Chromebooks will eventually be able to compete with Surface Pro 4 or iPad Pro, for now it is good to see Samsung and Google bringing high-end options in the segment. Sony 4K OLED TV has been made official We’d heard rumours about Sony bringing its ultimate 4K OLED TV to the market. At its press conference, the company confirmed this with the announcement of the new Bravia A1 OLED range. Available in 77-inch, 65-inch and 55-inch, the A1 series will feature the same X1 Extreme processor found previously in the Sony KD-65ZD9BU. Sony’s much-hyped 4K OLED TV has gone official at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. What’s interesting about the OLED TV is the company’s Acoustic Surface technology, which makes sound by vibrating the screen. Yes, the sound comes directly from the screen, removing the need for speakers. This 4K HDR TV runs Android TV, and supports Dolby Vision content. No word on price or availability, though honestly this will cost you a bomb. TCL-made BlackBerry smartphone revealed BlackBerry’s manufacturing partner TCL Communications Technology (TCT) has showed off the “Mercury” smartphone to selected press at the ongoing CES 2017. The smartphone hasn’t been announced yet; “Mercury” is still a working name. The company says you can expect more details about the BlackBerry-branded smartphone at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) later next month. Casio Smart Outdoors comes with Android Wear 2.0 Casio has announced a new smartwatch called the WSD-F20 at CES 2017. This is Casio’s second smartwatch, and is designed for outdoor use and also comes equipped with low power GPS and offline maps. This is also one of the first smartwatches (when it launches) to run Google’s much-delayed Android Wear 2.0. The WSD-F20 features a 1.32-inch dual-layer LCD display and is claimed to be water resistant. Casio didn’t reveal the pricing, but the company did say that one should expect the watch in April this year. ZTE’s crowd-sourced smartphone gets a name Last year, ZTE started working on its first crowd-sourced smartphone. At CES 2017, the company did share a few more details about the device. It’s called the Hawkeye, and one can pre-order it on Kickstarter beginning today for $199 (or approx Rs 13,485). The company still hasn’t locked the final specifications, but said that it will come with a 5.5-inch display and a fingerprint scanner. Interestingly, the most important aspect of the “Hawkeye” is eye tracking. The phone’s front-facing camera will track a user’s eye movements. The company says it expects to ship the device by September 2017.

German car giant BMW is planning to use augmented reality technology developed by Google to help it sell cars. The company announced on Thursday that it has released an Android app that utlitises Google’s new Tango technology, thereby enabling people to use their smartphones to view lifelike 3D models of certain BMW cars (the BMW i3 and the BMW i8) against a backdrop of the real world. The app — developed by technology consultancy firm Accenture — allows people to walk around a virtual car that isn’t really there and even step inside and explore the interior. It was uploaded to the Google Play Store on Thursday but it will only work on Tango-enabled devices, which are only just appearing on the market but include the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro and the Asus Zenfone AR. Using augmented reality in this way should allow BMW’s potential customers to familiarise themselves with its cars and explore various customisation options from the comfort of their living room. It should also provide car dealers with another tool to help them push their stock. BMW claims it is the first car company to use augmented reality in this way. Accenture Andrea Castronovo, BMW Group’s VP of sales strategy and future retail, said in a statement: “Our vehicles are emotional products and to get that emotional feeling, you really need to experience them. In situations where the desired product isn’t available on the spot, this visualisation is the next best thing.” Tango uses a combination of smartphone cameras, sensors and infrared to perceive the depth of an object. Eric Johnsen, head of business development for augmented reality at Google, said in a statement: “The thing that sets Tango apart is the fact that it understands the context of the space that it’s in. So the wheels are really on the floor, for example, giving the whole experience a much more realistic feel.” The BMW partnership with Google and Accenture highlights the increasing trend of car makers working with tech giants. On Wednesday, Ford announced plans to embed Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa into its vehicles.

[Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons The initial horror evoked by Oakland’s GhostShip fire is now turning into self questioning and anger at those who placed the victims in harms way. Yes, there will be individuals —landlords, inspectors, event organizers —held to account. But the political context of this tragedy is that artists — not only musicians, but graphic artists, photographers and other content creators–have been placed in a condition of risk and precarity by Silicon Valley’s trashing of the copyright laws— a mass expropriation of value which turned what was once an important source of income into an expense for working artists. Yes, marginal, new, and unsuccessful artists have long been precarious. But Silicon Valley’s implementation of a business model earning itself hundreds of billions via the ad based exploitation of copyright infringing work has marginalized an increasingly large number of working “content creators”, driving many into substandard housing, work spaces, and multiple jobs; and out of health insurance, safe housing, and sleep. The geographically marginal location of the GhostShip lofts— in Oakland’s industrial zone, far from the nightlife centers of SF, is not only a metaphor, but a sign and symptom of a wider and deeper phenomenon: the economic marginalization of working artists. The GhostShip’s Oakland location — right across the Bay from the SV corporations which drove them into fatal precarity — is also more than metaphor. These artists were driven out of less precarious situations by rent increases. San Franscisco real estate has gone through the ceiling as a direct result of the huge wealth of Silicon Valley corporate execs, investors, financiers, and employees. Rage at this Silicon Valley driven gentrification has been local news for almost a decade. Conflict between local residents and SV employees broke into violence over Google’s usage of public bus stops for their private busses. Leftists may not consider the local residents’ choice of an epithet (“dot.communist”) the ideal metaphor for evil, but it was meant to express the contempt Bay Area residents felt for the tech industry yuppies who drove them out of their homes and work places. Working artists were by no means the only San Franciscans displaced. But added to the injury of artist displacement was the insulting knowledge that the money enabling their displacers had been generated by their own labor, expropriated via ad based profits on infringing files of their own work, files often posted and used without their consent or remuneration. Silicon Valley propaganda outlets like the Google funded “Electronic Frontier Foundation” have long taken the position that the 60% collapse of the record industry caused by infringement was only hurting rich major record company exec’s, that somehow you could suck 7 billion a year out of an industry without hurting the working artists — and engineers, and indie label staff, and photographers/graphic artists/designers etc — who worked with them and lived off the sales of their music. So now the precarity caused by these policies has hurt real people. And the only thing unusual about those hurt or killed in the GhostShip fire was that, unlike the hundreds of thousands of individual, isolated disasters caused by structural precarity, this hurt made national headlines. Our personal disasters —the broken relationships of those working two jobs, or forced onto the road because that’s all that’s left, the deferment or avoidance of family due to poverty….the dislocations, evictions, foreclosures — will never be on CNN or Fox News. But we all know people, or are people, who have suffered them. “Precarity” describes the social dimension of supposedly “natural” disasters: the increased risk of death, injury, and misery for those pushed to the social edge. The cause of death may be attributed to natural phenomena: fire, flood, earthquake. But the degree of risk is created socially: politically, legally, economically. San Fransisco’s “Loma Prieta” earthquake of 1989 registered 6.9 on the richter scale and resulted in 63 deaths. The 2010 Haitian earthquake was a similar magnitude (7.0), but resulted in over 160,000 deaths. The earthquake didn’t kill: substandard housing did. It’s poverty, not nature, that places people in substandard housing. And it’s the lack of political rights and power that condemn populations to poverty. The precarity pushing ‘content creators” to the social edge is entirely political, caused not by digital technology itself, but by: 1. the special privilege “Safe Harbor” clauses of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1997-98, which prevent artists from seeking damages from online corporations, even those, like YouTube, whose business model is based on the mass infringement of artists rights. 2. The 2ndary boycott provision of the Taft Hartley law which limits the target of “collective economic (ie: union) action” to the immediate direct employer (meaning that almost all corporate profiteering from ‘content’ is off limits to labor action by almost all producers of content). Many people know that Taylor Swift withdrew her material from Spotify to protest its low rates of pay. Fewer know that if Ms. Swift had asked other artists to join her, or the public to boycott, she could have been sued for everything she ever made or ever will make. And if a union had made that call on her behalf, they could have seen all their assets, including pension funds, seized, and their officers arrested and placed under gag order. 3. Reagan era court decisions limiting the scope of anti-trust law, even when corporations are clearly using their “monopsony” power to crush producers. Rip, Mix, Burn The february 2003 edition of Wired Magazine celebrated the death of the recording industry with a cover (referring to Charles C Mann’s accompanying “The Year The Music Dies” article) consisting of a famous graphic image of the Hindenburg disaster, in which hundreds of passengers were burnt to death in the ill-fated zepellin’s launching.* This graphic image was accompanied by the text “Rip, Mix, Burn”, a slogan borrowed from an Apple campaign to both advertise their product as a tool for copyright infringement and rationalize the harm done to artists by presenting a for profit corporate campaign as anti-corporate direct action. Apple profited greatly from sales to consumers using their product precisely as suggested. Wired’s advertisers are often tech corporations reaping similar profits. The clear implication of Wired’s gleeful use of the Hindenberg disaster photo… is now obscene. We now know that “the music” didn’t die in 2003. Musicians still make music (using similar technological tools to those in use since the 90’s). People still listen to the music musicians make. Their listening is still mediated by corporations, and still produces (now more than ever) profits for those corporations. Only now those profits aren’t shared by the people who produce them. This isn’t ‘creative destruction’, or ‘technological unemployment’: its exploitation pure and simple. Thanks to the Safe Harbor clause of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and the 2ndary boycott provision of the Taft Hartley Law, content creators have been prevented from fighting this exploitation individually and collectively. Denied legal means of fighting back, politically swamped by the massive lobbying power and social media manipulation of Silicon Valley corporations, artists have been pushed into economic precarity and risk. As is so often the case with the violation of rights, violence against the body is the inevitable consequence. M.

The streaming box supports both 4K and HDR video output, and similar to the first-generation version of the Shield, it also works as a simple way to bring PC gaming to your living room via streaming. In terms of HDR, Nvidia’s new Shield will be compatible with both games and movies. Interestingly, the new Shield is also the first Android TV to support Google Assistant. If the hardware manufacture’s CES press conference is an accurate representation of Assistant’s integration with the Shield, Google’s voice-activated helper operates the same way as it does in the company’s Home and Pixel devices. It’s unclear if Nvidia also plans to bring its recently revealed Alexa-powered Spot microphone accessory — which seems to work the same as Amazon’s Echo — to Canada. We’ve reached out to Nvidia for clarification. It’s believed the new Shield is set to utilize the company’s X2 mobile processor, but Nvidia didn’t say definitively during its press conference, and some rumours point to the device coming equipped with the same Tegra X1 that’s found in the first Shield. In another uncharacteristic move, Nvidia also didn’t mention anything related to improved gaming performance with the Shield. Furthermore, while we know how much the new Shield will cost in Canada, it’s unclear what Canadian retailers will carry the set-top box. While the first-generation Shield was sold online and in-store at Canada Computers, the retailer eventually stopped stocking the device, leaving Canadians with no official retailer for the set-top box. At one point Best Buy Canada also carried the Shield, though the retailer eventually pulled the device from its shelves as well. It’s still unclear if Nvidia has a wider Canadian retail strategy for its new Shield. Update 01/05/16: Amazon Canada currently has the Nvidia Shield available for pre-order.

Will MobileSyrup be reviewing this? I’d be interested to see what services are actually available to Canadians. AJ What services do you want to know about? Its Android TV, so you can check out any other Android TV device (incl the current Shield TV) review for services/apps available. Not for you The Shield TV hasn’t been reviewed by MS (or any other Canadian site) as far as I’m aware. Amazon TV has been added to the “new” model, but it’d be good to get an understanding of what content is actually available to Canadian prime members. AJ I am hoping a software update should add Amazon Prime app to the old one too. Currently I am using the Prime app on my TV because of this. There’s an apk available which was taken from Sony Android TVs that kind of partly works on Shield. Anyways, the content available in Canada is very limited. You can install the app from Play Store on your Android phone to check available titles. Not for you Well, I mentioned Amazon as that seems to be the primary addition on the app front. What about the other apps? e.g. I assume HBO Go won’t work in Canada, but what about things like CBS? That’s the type of information I’d like from a MS review. Patrick O’Rourke We have a list of that right here. http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/12/14/amazon-prime-video-in-canada-complete-tv-and-movie-list/ Patrick O’Rourke If we can get our hands on one, I’ll certainly review it. Wunsch What exactly does this new version offer over the existing one? As far as I recall, the current Shield already supports 4k and already supports HDR. Chris G Thats the question. I would assume some performance benefits if its the x2. But so far a lot of assumption going around that it will still be the x1. just a refreshed version of the shield vs a new one (which still performs amazingly well might I add) Not for you According to nvidia’s own site, It’s still using the X1. Though it appears they had problems converting the dimensions to metric https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/12bd557ad91043e84f18c6929472f4ffaceab3bdba04b65a737131453a5955c3.png dirtyKIMCHI That’s one heavy device! Shogun Yeah you’re right. The current model supports 4K already so whatever upgrade this is sounds more like the chipset which is negligible. Beyond that the bigger issue is actually acquiring one Wunsch Oh, reading the wording of the announcement more carefully, they refer to “4k HDR” as a single unit. So maybe the current one supports 4k and supports HDR, but not together. Sounds like something Patrick should get clarification on in a future article 😉 Shogun Perhaps but it’s hardly much of an upgrade. bmccull I think they will have a new version (with few changes) just because you can’t market a 2+ year old tech device. AppleBerrySandwich Pre-ordered a unit – I have always wanted one. The package now has a remote and lots of software upgrades. Can’t wait to get it!

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau    5407150 The Department of Labor (DOL) filed a lawsuit against Google for failing to provide data and documents about its employees at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., the DOL announced Wednesday. The DOL asked the court to cancel all of Google’s current government contracts and block it from future contracts if it doesn’t comply, according to Investopedia. The information requested in September 2015 was part of a scheduled compliance review of federal contracts. The DOL conducts the reviews in order to combat discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, disability or status as a veteran. Under federal law, Google must agree to permit the federal government to inspect and copy records and information relevant to its compliance with equal employment laws. “The lawsuit seeks to enforce Google’s obligations to provide [The Federal Government] with compensation data, documents and requested information to complete its audit,” DOL said in a statement. “Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so.” Google responded to the lawsuit in a statement, calling the DOL’s requests “over-broad” and involving confidential information about employees. “These requests include thousands of employees’ private contact information, which we safeguard rigorously,” Google said in a statement. “We hope to continue working with OFCCP [The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs] to resolve this matter.” The tech giant said that it has provided DOL with “hundreds of thousands of records.” Google only partially answered the questions, and refused to provide some relevant wage information requested by the agency, according to the lawsuit. Google is the latest technology company to be the target of Obama’s Labor Department. The DOL sued Palantir, a data software startup co-founded by Peter Thiel, in September for allegedly discriminating against Asian job applicants.

Image Credit: Screenshot Google is announcing today that its Google Calendar app for Android and iOS now lets users set goals to do different kinds of fitness activities for specific periods of time. From there, the app can slot in times when users can actually make good on those promises. The app now contains a way to check on the progress of your fitness goals, too. It can even automatically mark individual workout events as completed if you integrate Google Calendar with Apple’s iOS Health app or the Google Fit app for Android. And, in keeping with Google’s increasing focus on artificial intelligence (AI), the app is smart. Google product manager Florian Goerisch provides an example in a blog post: Say you set a goal to run at 6:30 every other morning but aren’t actually hitting your stride until 7:15 — Google Calendar has you covered and will adjust accordingly. So not only can Calendar keep track of your activities and performance, it can also help you find the best time to do them. Google has previously incorporated artificial intelligence savvy into Inbox by Gmail (Smart Reply), Allo (Smart Reply), Docs, Sheets, and Slides (Explore), among other things. Google first introduced Goals in Google Calendar last year. Like regular goals, goal-oriented fitness events can be viewed on the web but can only be created in the mobile apps, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email.

Google Calendar integrates with Google Fit and Apple Health to help you stick to your fitness goals Posted Jan 5, 2017 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Father-to-be uses VR to ‘meet’ his daughter before she’s born With Goals, Google launched a new Google Calendar feature last year that allowed you to easily schedule and track certain goals you set for yourself. Right in time for people to forget their New Year’s resolutions, Google today announced an update to Goals and Google Calendar that allows you to connect Google Fit and Apple Health to the fitness goals you set in Goals. Once you hit your goal, your Google Calendar items will automatically be marked as “done.” When you look at your fitness goals in Google Calendar, Google will also show you how well you’ve done so far. Google, of course, is also building some of its machine learning smarts into this service. If it notices that your goal was to go running every morning at 5am but then notices that you never start trotting until 7am anyway, it’ll automatically reschedule the activity for you. Chances are, Google will integrate more services with Goals over time, but fitness tracking makes for an obvious service to start with, especially given the ubiquity of fitness trackers and the fact that it doesn’t even take any special hardware (except for a compatible smartphone) to get started with services like Google Fit. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

But a new type of attack has emerged that can knock out 911 access – our research explains how these attacks occur as a result of the system's vulnerabilities WHAT'S THE HACK?  Researchers from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev explain hackers can use an attack called 'denial-of-service' to block the public's from accessing 911. These cybercriminals hijack smartphones and infect them with malware that lets them control the devices. They are then able to prompt the phones to call 911 in a continues loop. This floods the system, as computers have their limit on how much traffic they can receive.  The researchers created a computer simulation of North Carolina's 911 infrastructure, and a general simulation of the entire U.S. emergency-call system.  They found that it was possible to reduce the availability of 911 service with only 6,000 infected mobile phones – just 0.0006 percent of the state's population.  Nationally, a similar percentage, representing just 200,000 hijacked smartphones, would have a similar effect.  We show these attacks can create extremely serious repercussions for public safety. In recent years, people have become more aware of a type of cyberattack called 'denial-of-service,' in which websites are flooded with traffic – often generated by many computers hijacked by a hacker and acting in concert with each other.  This happens all the time, and has affected traffic to financial institutions, entertainment companies, government agencies and even key internet routing services. A similar attack is possible on 911 call centers.  In October, what appears to be the first such attack launched from a smartphone happened in Arizona.  An 18-year-old hacker was arrested on charges that he conducted a telephone denial-of-service attack on a local 911 service.  If we are to prevent this from happening in more places, we need to understand how 911 systems work, and where the weaknesses lie, both in technology and policy. Computer networks have capacity limits – they can handle only so much traffic, so many connections, at one time.  If they get overloaded, new connections can't get through.  The same thing happens with phone lines – which are mostly computer network connections anyway.

Share this article Share 237 shares So if an attacker can manage to tie up all the available connections with malicious traffic, no legitimate information – like regular people browsing a website, or calling 911 in a real emergency – can make it through. This type of attack is most often done by spreading malware to a great many computers, infecting them so that they can be controlled remotely.  People have become more aware of a type of cyberattack called 'denial-of-service,' in which websites are flooded with traffic – often generated by many computers hijacked by a hacker and acting in concert with each other. and a similar attack is possible on 911 call centers Smartphones, which are after all just very small computers, can also be hijacked in this way.  Then the attacker can tell them to inundate a particular site or phone number with traffic, effectively taking it offline. Many internet companies have taken significant steps to guard against this sort of attack online.  For example, Google Shield is a service that protect news sites from attacks by using Google's massive network of internet servers to filter out attacking traffic while allowing through only legitimate connections.  Phone companies, however, have not taken similar action. Before 1968, American emergency services had local phone numbers.  People had to dial specific numbers to reach the fire, police or ambulance services – or could dial '0' for the operator, who could connect them.  But that was inconvenient, and dangerous – people couldn't remember the right number, or didn't know it because they were just visiting the area. The 911 system was created to serve as a more universal and effective system.  As it has developed over the years, a 911 caller is connected with a specialized call center – called a public safety answering point – that is responsible for getting information from the caller and dispatching the appropriate emergency services. TEEN ATTACKS 911 IN ARIZONA  Meetkumar Desai, 18, told police he created a 'non-harmful' bug meant to be a funny prank that would also put some more cash in his own bank. Desai, who describes himself as a visual designer and front-end developer, was searching for glitches in Apple's iOS system as part of its bug bounty program. Meetkumar Desai (pictured) , 18, created a bug that attacked the 911 system in Arizona last year The program, launched in September, offers cash rewards that range from $25,000 to $200,000 to those who find vulnerabilities in the company's software, such as being able to access iCloud account data, and then privately report them to Apple. Desai told investigators an online friend have given him a bug they thought he might be able to tweak. The teenager manipulated the bug, adding 'pop-ups, commands that would open email and activate the telephone dialing feature on iOS cell phones', according to Ars Technica. He then decided to have the dialing feature call emergency services, creating a java script code that would automatically dial 911 when people clicked on a link. Desai claimed he had made two versions of the link, saying he had no plans to push out the 911 link because he knew it was illegal and would cause people to 'freak out'. Desai was arrested on charges that he conducted a telephone denial-of-service attack on a local 911 service.  He manipulated the bug so that it would activate the dialing feature on iOS cell phones and begin calling 911 on a loop TheHackSpot also encouraged people to click on the link, which police said was opened nearly 1,900 times from the YouTube channel. Surprise Police Department, which is in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, received more than 100 calls within minutes after Desai's link was posted. The nearby Peoria Police Department and Maricopa County Sheriff's Office were also suddenly flooded with calls. What made the link even more harmful was that Desai had allegedly set it up so that the program would call 911 on a loop, repeatedly dialing the number after someone hung up. These call centers are located in communities across the country, and each provides service to specific geographic regions.  Some serve individual cities, while others serve wider areas, such as counties.  When telephone customers dial 911 on their landlines or mobile phones, the telephone companies' systems make the connection to the appropriate call center. To better understand how denial-of-service attacks could affect 911 call systems, we created a detailed computer simulation of North Carolina's 911 infrastructure, and a general simulation of the entire U.S. emergency-call system. After we set up our simulation, we attacked it to find out how vulnerable it is.  We found that it was possible to significantly reduce the availability of 911 service with only 6,000 infected mobile phones – just 0.0006 percent of the state's population. Using only that relatively small number of phones, it is possible to effectively block 911 calls from 20 percent of North Carolina landline callers, and half of mobile customers.  In our simulation, even people who called back four or five times would not be able to reach a 911 operator to get help. Nationally, a similar percentage, representing just 200,000 hijacked smartphones, would have a similar effect.  But this is, in a certain sense, an optimistic finding.  Trey Forgety, the director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, responded to our findings in the Washington Post, saying, 'We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated.' These sorts of attacks could, potentially, be made less effective if malicious calls were identified and blocked at the moment they were placed.  Mobile phones have two different kinds of identifying information.  The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is the phone number a person must call to reach that phone.  The IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) is used to track the specific physical device on the network. Experts found that it would only take 200,000 hijacked smartphones to nationally affect people's access  A defense system could be set up to identify 911 calls coming from a particular phone that has made more than a certain number of 911 calls in a given period of time – say more than 10 calls in the last two minutes. This raises ethical problems – what if there is a real and ongoing emergency, and someone keeps losing phone reception while talking to a dispatcher?  If they called back too many times, would their cries for help be blocked?  In any case, attackers who take over many phones could circumvent this sort of defense by telling their hijacked phones to call less frequently – and by having more individual phones make the calls. But federal rules to ensure access to emergency services mean this issue might be moot anyway.  A 1996 Federal Communications Commission order requires mobile phone companies to forward all 911 calls directly to emergency dispatchers.  Cellphone companies are not allowed to check whether the phone the call is coming from has paid to have an active account in service.  They cannot even check whether the phone has a SIM card in place.  The FCC rule is simple: If anyone dials 911 on a mobile phone, they must be connected to an emergency call center. The rule makes sense from a public safety perspective: If someone is having (or witnessing) a life-threatening emergency, they shouldn't be barred from seeking help just because they didn't pay their cellphone bill, or don't happen to have an active account. But the rule opens an vulnerability in the system, which attackers can exploit.  A sophisticated attacker could infect a phone in a way that makes it dial 911 but report it does not have a SIM card.  This 'anonymized' phone reports no identity, no phone number and no information about who owns it.  Neither the phone company nor the 911 call center could block this call without possibly blocking a legitimate call for help. The countermeasures that exist, or are possible, today are difficult and highly flawed.  Many of them involve blocking certain devices from calling 911, which carries the risk of preventing a legitimate call for help.  But they indicate areas where further inquiry – and collaboration between researchers, telecommunications companies, regulators and emergency personnel – could yield useful breakthroughs. For example, cellphones might be required to run a monitoring software to block themselves from making fraudulent 911 calls.  Or 911 systems could examine identifying information of incoming calls and prioritize those made from phones that are not trying to mask themselves.  We must find ways to safeguard the 911 system, which protects us all.

For years, the biggest names in tech crammed the Consumer Electronics Show floor with fridges, light switches and microwave ovens to preview a futuristic world where you could control every appliance in the home with your voice. But most of these products, bogged down by glitchy software and hard-to-navigate interfaces, failed to go mainstream. This year may be different. Aided by new artificial intelligence software that makes it easier for gadgets to understand speech, tech giants led by Amazon.com Inc. are locked in a race for dominance of digital home assistants. "People are a bit disappointed with assistants, because there are no clear use cases," said Greg Gerard, creative chairman of Holi, which is debuting a $199 smart alarm clock called Bonjour. "We have one.” Gerard must show regular consumers the value of smart assistant technology. But he doesn't need to convince big technology firms, which all believe voice-based interactions with devices will explode in popularity. Almost every major tech company has or will soon introduce a digital assistant product powered by AI. And they're making a concerted effort to spread the technology everywhere. Alphabet Inc.'s Google is using CES to tout tie-ups with its smart Home speaker, a device similar to Amazon's Echo. Microsoft Corp. has invested heavily in its assistant, Cortana. Samsung Electronics Co. is set to unveil its assistant tech for its phones and other devices in 2017. Last month, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg showed off a smart home assistant he said he coded himself.  Behind the scenes at CES, these tech behemoths will fight to get their voice-based systems into televisions, cable boxes and every home appliance, not just smartphones and PCs. Analysts expect several dozen announcements around voice-systems at this week's event in Las Vegas, including new functions for internet-connected devices and cars. Ford Motor Co. unveiled an integration with Alexa on Wednesday.  Then there are the specialized assistants, ranging from the Bonjour clock, which Gerard said will arrive later this year, to a personal home robot from startup Jibo -- a compact, futuristic device designed to recognize human emotions, said company Chief Executive Officer Steve Chambers. Research firm Tractica estimates about 40 million homes will use a voice-activated digital assistant by 2021.  Amazon's version, Alexa, introduced in 2014 on the Echo speaker, works with more than 6,000 applications, according to a company spokeswoman. On Tuesday, Amazon announced a partnership with Whirlpool Corp., adding voice command capabilities to Whirlpool washers, dryers, ovens and refrigerators.  Amazon has built an effective developer outreach strategy and introduced a $100 million investment fund for startups creating products around voice applications. Unlike other tech peers, Amazon has a dominant sales channel for its voice-assistance partners. "Amazon has been brilliant about it," said Mark Beccue, an analyst at Tractica. "They might be the best trigger to the smart home, to making it a mass-market product."  Google Makes Its Splash Last year, Biz Stone revamped his startup, Jelly Industries Inc., as a search engine—something that puts it up against Google. But when Google began hunting partners last month for its Home speaker, Jelly was among the first to sign on. Google was a zealous suitor. Employees treated him to lunch and when the deal closed a Google operative sent him an animated gif of Seinfeld characters dancing. "They've been a joy to work with," said Stone, who co-founded Twitter Inc.  Google's aggressive courtship is understandable; it's behind Amazon. Since inception, Google's business was based on keyboard-based searches. Now the web giant is refocusing its strategy around its voice assistant, a system that sits in its speaker, Pixel smartphone and—if Google succeeds— every device imaginable. On Tuesday at CES, Google announced a partnership with Hyundai Motor Co. that lets drivers control some car functions by talking to the Home speaker. It's expected to unveil more assistant partnerships with devices like smart TVs. Google has an edge in building voice technology, thanks to its unmatched repository of search data. But the company must prove it can distribute its assistant widely. Hurdles exist. The same month Google debuted its Pixel phone, Samsung, the largest Android phone manufacturer, acquired Viv Labs, a startup building a voice-powered assistant. Samsung plans to roll out an AI platform for its devices this year, the company said in a statement. Apple Inc., which tightly controls about 40 percent of U.S. smartphones, is investing in a similar push with its Siri voice assistant.  Microsoft already has software tools for developers to embed Cortana into devices, and its automotive partners will announce new integrations at CES, said Matthew Quinlan, Cortana's director of product marketing. "For Cortana to do her job, she needs to be in a lot of different devices." And there's Facebook. The company has said that Zuckerberg's smart-home tech was merely a demonstration. Yet the social network is testing more bot integrations with the AI-assistant in its popular Messenger chat app, a product Google has struggled to deliver. Still, Amazon remains the one to catch. For developers building voice-assisted tools, the company offers support from its already popular cloud-computing platform, giving it another edge. "You are not going to see a clear no. 2 emerge in 2017," said Forrester analyst Mike Gualtieri. "Technologically, Google is the closest competitor. But in terms of Google's ability to get it into homes, I question that." Assistant Nightmare Another question is how to make money from a voice-controlled home. Profit margins on hardware sales are usually thin and voice-controlled computers may throw a wrench in established business models, like text-based web search.   Some investors backing the technology aren't concerned. "There are lots and lots of ways you can monetize when you control the interface," said John Lilly, a venture capitalist with Greylock Partners. "You control control information flow. You can route requests. You can certainly ship people stuff."  Lilly, who backs AI assistant startup Ozlo, insists young companies can make dents in the market with more advanced technology, like systems that can carry on complex conversations, rather than the relatively simple commands Alexa uses. However, analysts are skeptical that startups can match the budgets and data reserves of public tech companies.  Still, that may not dissuade companies, large and small, from trying to build their own voice assistants. With that rush, the question of who controls the tools will become paramount. "In less than three years, every home will have the opportunity to have this digital assistant," said Forrester's Gualtieri. "Now you’ll have the question of who am I talking to: Amazon Echo or my refrigerator? So that could be a nightmare."

But, is that enough to compete with the industry leaders? By Alison DeNisco | January 5, 2017, 7:32 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: LG LG has thrown its hat into the digital assistant ring. Hub Robot, the company's competitor to Amazon Echo and Google Home, was announced at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Hub Robot "takes the concept of the smart home to the next level," according to a press release. The small, white, anthropomorphic assistant uses Amazon Alexa's voice recognition technology to connect with IoT devices in a user's home or office. More from CES 2017 Best of CES 2017: The top 10 business products CES 2017: Cracking open Google Home live on the CNET stage See all of TechRepublic's CES 2017 coverage CES 2017: The big trends for business (ZDNet Special Feature) While Hub Robot performs many of the same tasks as the Echo and Google Home, such as playing music, setting alarms, and offering weather alerts, LG said the difference lies in its ability to complete household tasks. The assistant can connect to LG appliances, allowing a user to turn on the air conditioning, preheat the oven, or change a dryer cycle with a voice command, according to the press release. The robot's display can also show images of contents inside your refrigerator, and display recipes with audio instructions. However, the assistant can only perform these tasks if a user already owns or decides to purchase LG appliances. But, given that Hub Robot runs on Amazon's Alexa technology, it's likely that LG could partner with other companies in the future. SEE: CES 2017 Special Coverage (CNET) | CES 2017 (TechRepublic) | CES 2017: The Big Trends for Business (ZDNet) Hub Robot is more human-like in appearance than the Echo or Google Home. It has two glowing blue eyes, and is designed to express a range of emotions by displaying different faces. "The Hub Robot is designed to respond to consumers using body language, such as nodding its head when answering simple questions, and is always aware of activities inside the home, such as when family members leave, come home and go to bed," the press release stated. The device also features a camera that can distinguish between different people's faces, and can be programmed to greet individuals in different ways—which neither the Echo nor Google Home can currently do. But, Hub Robot will face stiff competition from those current industry leaders, which both announced new partnerships and use cases at CES 2017 as well. Alexa will soon be found in Whirlpool appliances, Lenovo smart devices, Ford cars, and ADT security systems. The Alexa skill store now lists over 7,000 skills—up from 6,000 just three weeks ago. Clearly, companies see the benefit of integrating with Alexa to reach customers at home and in the office. Meanwhile, Google announced partnerships with Daimler and Hyundai to integrate Google Assistant into vehicles, and also said that Google Assistant will come to Android TV this year. The company unveiled its Actions on Google developer platform in December. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers At CES 2017, LG announced Hub Robot, a digital assistant built with Amazon Alexa voice recognition technology to connect with IoT devices in a user's home or office. Hub Robot differs from competitors Amazon Echo and Google Home in that it can recognize different users, and connect to LG appliances. However, with both Alexa and Google Assistant rapidly expanding with new partnerships, it may be difficult for LG to compete unless it makes similar relationships with other manufacturers.

Music-sharing website which could be bought by Google – here’s what we know The music site could be snapped up by Google after talks with Spotify fell through By Laura Burnip 5th January 2017, 4:56 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments SOUNDCLOUD is rumoured to be in takeover talks with Google – just weeks after a possible deal with Spotify fell through. But what is the streaming site, how much is it worth and how is it different from other sites? Here’s what we know… Alamy 6 The streaming site was a challenger to MySpace back in the early days of music streaming What is Soundcloud? The Berlin-based site was launched in 2007 as a social media network for musicians to record, upload and share their work with others. It soon became a way of musicians distributing their work to listeners – challenging MySpace as the dominant platform because of its flexibility. Artists including Sonic Youth, Moby and Beck turned to SoundCloud to release new tracks, with no file-size limit. Reuters 6 Founder Alexander Ljung wanted to create a platform which allowed artists to interact with listeners But SoundCloud had no deals set up with the major music companies, causing problems because copyrighted material kept being uploaded onto the site and used in remixes. Some feared a massive copyright infringement lawsuit was just around the corner, and striking up the necessary deals was a slow process. The company eventually managed to strike up a deal with the Warner Music Group in November 2014, followed by Merlin in 2015, Universal Music Group and Sony Music in 2016. In September, after posting subsequent losses, the company was revealed to have boosted its top line revenues by 43% in just one year, reported digitalmusicnews. Alamy 6 Beck was among the early proponents of SoundCloud, uploading his work through the streaming site Is SoundCloud free? The original site was completely free, but later launched Soundcloud Go, its premium subscription service in 2016. At £9.99 a month, it allows users to listen offline and ad-free with access to more tracks than the free version. Following the various deals with the big music companies, more and more big name artists have been uploading tracks to the site. Getty Images 6 Some of the site’s 175million users at SoundCloud Go’s official launch party in Berlin in 2016 How much is SoundCloud worth? The site has previously been valued at between $700m and $1billion, but the potential Google deal is said to be worth $500m. At the end of last year, Spotify was reported to be interested in buying SoundCloud, but the companies were unable to agree on a price. According to itechpost, SoundCloud lowered its price tag from $1b during takeover negotiations with Spotify. TechCrunch reported that the deal fell through because of the potential “licensing headache” of negotiating with music labels. Alamy 6 Artists such as Moby were followed to the site by stars like Justin Bieber and Kanye West after it struck up deals with the big music companies How is SoundCloud different from Spotify? The sharing site has more than 130million tracks on offer – far more than Spotify’s 30m. Many of these are DJ mixes, remixes and podcasts which are exclusive to SoundCloud and can’t be found anywhere else. So users can create playlists of amateur musicians, podcasts and big name artists – as well as being able to comment on them and share feedback. But Business Insider estimated last year that the site only had around 15million songs which you couldn’t get on the free version. However since then, the site appears to have expanded its SoundCloud Go offering, including hundreds of tracks by big names such as Kanye West. 6 The platform allows users to create playlists of established artists, remixes and unknown acts How many people are on SoundCloud? The site has more users than any other streaming service, with more than 175million users to date. Spotify has around 100million, of which around a third are paid users – but has to pay 70% of its revenue to record labels. While it isn’t known how many users have signed up to SoundCloud Go, industry experts estimate it is only around 250,000, according to Bloomberg.

Photo: CNA, courtesy of Asustek Computer Inc Asustek Computer Inc (華碩) on Wednesday announced it is launching a new smartphone which uses Google Tango 3D technology, allowing users to experience augmented and virtual reality. The Zenfone AR is just the second handset to incorporate the Tango computing platform, which allows for indoor mapping, augmented reality and more. The new device, unveiled by Asustek at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, is also one of a small number of smartphones that is compatible with Google Daydream, the US tech giant’s virtual-reality system. “We are excited to be the first to enable Tango and Daydream,” Asustek chairman Jonney Shih (施崇棠) said as he unveiled the new handset, which will be available in the second quarter of this year. Shih said the new phone “enables interaction with virtual objects” and offers the ability to watch a movie or play a game in virtual or augmented reality. “This is really the next wave that is going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Asustek marketing chief Erik Hermanson said. Project Tango uses depth sensing and motion tracking to create onscreen 3D experiences, allowing users to get a better picture of a physical environment for functions such as home decoration. Google Project Tango leader Johnny Lee, who joined the Asustek media event, said he expected “dozens of Tango-enabled apps” to be available soon on the Google Play store. The only other handset using Project Tango is Lenovo Group Ltd’s (聯想) Phab2 phone, which was released last year. Asustek said it would be releasing another new smartphone, the Zenfone 3 Zoom, with upgraded camera technology that delivers professional-quality images. Separately, HTC Corp (宏達電) is launching trackers for its Vive virtual-reality system that users can attach to physical objects such as bats or toy guns to make them part of a virtual-reality adventure. During a media briefing at the show on Wednesday, the company showcased a number of tracker-enabled accessories, including what it says is the first virtual-reality camera, multiple rifles built for virtual-reality shooters and haptic gloves. The tracker weighs less than 85g and to foster more development, HTC is giving away up to 1,000 to developers. The company is also launching its first ever app subscription service, which allows unlimited access to virtual-reality apps for a flat monthly fee. The service is to launch early this year, but HTC did not say how much it would cost. Meanwhile, China’s Huawei Technologies Co (華為) is adding Amazon.com Inc’s artificial intelligence application Alexa to its flagship Mate 9 smartphone. The Mate 9, a large-screen phablet marketed as a rival to the big handsets from Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co, is to be made available in the US early this year, the firm said at the Las Vegas show. Huawei said it is the first smartphone with preinstalled Amazon Alexa, a cloud-based, voice-activated digital assistant that can control smart home devices or respond to questions.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday January 16, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode ATO investigates 35 e-commerce multinationals for sending income offshore Nassim Khadem 17 Sep 2016, 12:15 a.m. Thirty-five e-commerce companies are under review or audit by the Australian Taxation Office for routing income through low-tax nations such as Singapore to avoid paying tax locally.

Photo: Dominic Lorrimer Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Thirty-five e-commerce companies are under review or audit by the Australian Taxation Office for routing income through low-tax nations such as Singapore to avoid paying tax locally. The move comes as more companies challenge the ATO's right to tax their profits by appealing directly to international tax authorities. In an interview with Fairfax Media, ATO deputy commissioner Mark Konza also signalled a warning to companies "contriving" new tax arrangements to escape being hit by the federal government's new anti-avoidance laws, known informally as Australia's "Google tax". He said the ATO was looking at the tax structures used by several well-known multinationals that route profits through low-tax nations. Pressed about which low-tax nations he was referring to, Mr Konza would not name specific countries or companies, but said many of the cases were detailed during the recent Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance. Companies including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Uber and Airbnb were just some of the companies interrogated during that inquiry for their use of low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions. Of the 35 e-commerce cases under investigation, Mr Konza said 17 were at review stage, and 18 were under audit. Those reviews and audits are focused on whether the amount of income declared in Australia is adequate, he said. Is enough income being declared? Mr Konza said the recent high-profile European Commission decision against Apple –  that the company had received "illegal state aid" and will have to pay back up to €13 billion ($19 billion) in back taxes, plus interest, to Ireland – did not have direct implications on Australian taxpayers. That was about whether the correct tax rate had been applied to income, he said. In the Australian context it was about whether the right amount of income has been declared in Australia. At the Senate inquiry, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan accused multinationals including Apple, Microsoft and Google of giving inaccurate evidence and signalled they had been under audit for "aggressive tax planning". The inquiry heard, for example, that in Google and Microsoft's case, the companies sent income to low-tax Singapore as well as no-tax nations such as Bermuda. The inquiry had also heard from companies such as Uber, which routes through Nethrlands, and Airbnb which sends income through Ireland. Uber has, for example, paid just over $403,000 tax in Australia over a three-year period. Appeals against tax bills on the rise If a company feels that they have been unfairly taxed by two different countries, it can appeal to tax administrators. In recent years the number of multinational companies appealing Australia's right to tax – under an international process known as a mutual agreement procedure (MAP) –  has spiked. These cases do not just impact e-commerce companies, but all multinationals, particularly those involved in transfer pricing disputes. ATO figures show that as of June 30 2016 there were 37 MAP cases in progress (up from 23 at the end of 2015), most of which relate to transfer pricing issues. The ATO said so far 13 MAP cases have been finalised (10 of which were related to transfer pricing). Of the 10 transfer pricing-related MAP cases finalised, nine resulted in revenue "adjustments", five of which saw more revenue flowing to Australia, and four of which resulted in less revenue. Asked how much revenue this amounted to, an ATO spokesman said: "We do not give out details about revenue adjustments." Mr Konza said the ATO was working with the OECD to avoid tax revenue wars with overseas tax administrators. "There's been a lot of progress over the past three years in getting clearer and agreed rules on how things should be done," Mr Konza said. Multinationals try to circumvent the "Google tax"  The bigger concern, Mr Konza said, was that a number of companies and their tax advisers were turning to dubious tax structures to avoid getting hit by the federal government's multinational anti-avoidance laws (MAAL). The MAAL applies to multinational groups that operate in Australia but book their profits offshore. As previously revealed to Fairfax Media, ​the ATO has identified 175 companies that may fall within the scope of the laws. Mr Konza said to escape being hit by the laws, tricky schemes were being developed whereby an Australian partnership is interposed between the foreign company and the Australian customer. The multinationals then claim that because the partnership is technically an "Australian entity" for tax purposes – even though its profits are predominantly allocated to offshore entities for tax purposes –  the MAAL does not apply. But Mr Konza said he was appalled by the conduct of two taxpayers – one was a service company and the other was a financial services company – that had used this "contrived" and "artificial" arrangement to prevent being hit by the laws. He said in one purported partnership case just 1 per cent of the income was coming to the Australian entity, and 99 per cent was still going through the foreign entity. "I was quite shocked by what I saw," Mr Konza said. "I thought it was a blatant attempt [to work] against the will of Parliament." The amount of money involved in these two matters was worth tens of millions of dollars, but Mr Konza said it was not about the amount of individual tax involved, but the fact that their intent was to undermine the laws. "That's a situation that the ATO and the federal government will not tolerate," he said. The story ATO investigates 35 e-commerce multinationals for sending income offshore first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Especially if you are using Google Home and it virtual assistant. If you are one of the owners – or you want to become one – then Google has announced that it will bring Google Assistant to TVs, Android smartwatches and in cars. According to a blog post by Google the Assistant was created in order to “get things done across a number of different places, contexts and situations”. So, the company chose the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) to share the update Android TV The first stop for Google Assistant the Android TV in the months to come. With the upcoming update on supported TVs and set-top boxes powered by Android TV, you’ll be able to ask the Google Assistant for help. The next thing is to pick the content you love, faster than ever, on the best screen in your house. You just ask the Google Assistant and forget about typing. Now that’s an assistant i like to have. Google Assistant on Android TV can help you with many tasks, such as play content or discover new things to watch on YouTube. Ask about summaries and get information about movies and TV shows. And right before the show set the right mood and adjust the lights. Also, in the upcoming months, Google Assistant on Android TV will come to the NVIDIA SHIELD, along with all Android TVs in the US running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or Android 7.0 Nougat, such as the AirTV Player, Sharp Aquos, Sony Bravia, Xiaomi Mi Box, and more. But, TVs won’t be the only one to get the Assistant treatment. Smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0, Android-powered in-car infotainment systems and many other types of devices through the Embedded Google Assistant SDK. More Actions on Google Last month the company announced Actions on Google, the developer platform for the Google Assistant. And it seems that there will be a number of services available for Google Home. Visitors at CES  in Las Vegas will have the opportunity to hear some of the integrations such as Daimler and Hyundai. Google says that there will be more updates regarding Google home and its virtual assistant. Are we going to see an upgraded hardware? Who knows! We have more that 350 days to find out.

SUBSCRIBE Amazon Alexa now has more than 7,000 voice apps, Google Assistant coming to TV Competition among virtual assistants heating up as they move to a broader range of connected devices and appliances. Greg Sterling on January 5, 2017 at 11:36 am More Amazon’s Alexa now has more than 7,000 “skills” (voice apps), according to a presentation given at CES (the Computer Electronics Show) by Amazon’s Mike George, who demonstrated an LG refrigerator with Alexa built in. Alexa, like Microsoft’s Cortana, is making a push to be included in a broad range of third-party connected devices. Earlier this week, Lenovo introduced an Alexa-powered Echo-like speaker. In addition to Alexa itself, Amazon is making the full range of skills available to third-party developers and manufacturers as well. Skills discovery is even larger problem than smartphone app discovery because there’s no good voice-based way to find skills, although you can discover skills via the Alexa app or online. Not wanting to be completely overshadowed by Alexa in the digital assistant arena, Google announced that “The Google Assistant is making its way to Android TV in the coming months.” The Google Assistant will search for and play media, but Google also sees the Assistant on TV as smart home controller and general search tool (like Home). Here are some of the example actions/commands for Google Assistant on your TV: Play content: “Play Stranger Things on Netflix.” Discover content: “Search YouTube for Jimmy Kimmel.” And you can also ask a follow-up if you’re interested in more videos by saying: “Play the second one.” Get answers: “Tell me about Jurassic Park.” Set the right mood: “Dim the lights.” Get ready for your day: “How long will it take to get to work?” It remains to be seen whether the rumors about Apple introducing its own Siri-powered stand-alone device are true — though Apple risks being marginalized in the smart home if it doesn’t. What’s clear, however, is that with the introduction of these new third-party hardware integrations, we’re entering a dynamic period of competition for virtual assistants and voice search.

The Run IQ is compatible with both iPhone and Android phones and comes with the Strava app as a pre-loaded feature. It's also set up to stream up to 50 GB of Google Play music directly from the watch, making it easier to leave your phone at home when you head out on a run.  ALSO: The Year in Running and Cycling, According to Strava Data If all of this sounds somewhat familiar to you, that's because, aside from the Strava- and Google Play–related bells and whistles, it's all pretty standard for a GPS watch. People around the internet have been predictably eager to point this out as some sort of shortcoming, which, assuming everything works as promised, it absolutely is not. In fact, you could very easily make the argument that the Run IQ packs the most impressive set of features of any comparably priced watch on the market — and it outshines quite a few watches that demand far more than the relatively modest $299 New Balance is asking.  We had a chance to spend a few minutes with the Run IQ a few weeks ago, and while we can't speak to how it performed on a run, we can say it has a lot going for it. Navigation is intuitive, the materials are high-quality, it feels good on the wrist, and the screen is beautiful. We expect to have a test unit later this month, so we'll have a full review soon.  New Balance also announced the launch of Pace IQ, a set of wireless headphones designed with help from Jabra, one of the leaders in wireless headphone technology. They'll sell for $109.  Both items are available for pre-order now and will begin shipping on or before 2/1.  Add a Comment Sign Up for the Men's Journal Newsletter!

SUBSCRIBE Chrome’s DevTools for SEO: 10 ways to use these browser features for your SEO audits If you're conducting an SEO audit, you should probably be using DevTools in Google Chrome. Columnist Aleyda Solis shares 10 ways to use these tools to identify and fix SEO issues. Aleyda Solis on January 5, 2017 at 10:08 am More Although many of us in the industry pay hundreds or even thousands for SEO software that helps to automate and simplify our everyday work, we already have one of the most handy free SEO tool sets in the market with Google Chrome’s DevTools. Built into Google Chrome, this set of web authoring and debugging tools allows us to validate some of the most fundamental and critical SEO aspects of any page. In most cases, using DevTools is pretty straightforward. But there are a few very handy and not so obvious applications for SEO analysis. Let’s go through them now. Start by navigating to the page you want to investigate in Google Chrome and opening DevTools. You can do this by selecting More Tools > Developer Tools from the Google Chrome menu in the upper right-hand corner of your browser window. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Cmd+Opt+I (Mac), or you can right-click on the page element you’d like to investigate and click “Inspect” from the drop-down menu that appears. 1. Check your page’s main content elements, including JavaScript-rendered ones Google is now able to crawl and index JavaScript-based content, but it doesn’t always do so flawlessly. Therefore, it is a must to verify the main content elements of your pages — not only by reviewing their HTML source code, but also by checking their DOM to see how the information will be actually rendered and identified by Google. You can directly see the DOM of any page with DevTools in the “Elements” panel. Use this to review the content of any of the page’s elements (such as the title, meta description or page text) to verify that the desired relevant information is shown in each case, to make sure it’s accessible to Google. For example, in the upper left screen shot below, we can see how the displayed main text (in red) is included in a <div>. But this is actually implemented with JavaScript, the code for which can be seen in the upper right screen shot below, which shows the page’s HTML source code. [Click to enlarge]When identifying these differences between the content shown in both, you can then take the appropriate steps to verify it’s being indexed correctly: reviewing the page cached version in Google, verifying if the text is being shown in Google’s results when searching for it, using the “Fetch as Googlebot” in Google Search Console and so on. 2. Look for CSS hidden content It’s known that Google “discounts” text content that, although included in the page’s HTML source code, is hidden to the user by default with tabs or menu options that need to be “clicked” to view or expand them. Among the most common ways to hide text is by using CSS with the “display:none” or “visibility:hidden” properties, so it’s recommended to check if there’s any important information on your site pages that might be hidden via these means. You can do this with Chrome’s DevTools “Search” drawer, which you can access by hitting Ctrl + Shift + F (Windows) or Cmd + Opt + F (Mac) when DevTools is open. This search feature will allow you to look not only through the opened page file itself but across all of the used resources, including CSS and JavaScript. Here, you can search for the desired properties, in this case “hidden” or “display:none” to identify if/where they exist within the page code. Click on a search result to view the full code surrounding the property you’ve searched for. Review the code to see which text is being hidden; if it’s important content, check if it’s being discounted by Google, and take the appropriate actions. 3. Verify your images ALT descriptions Besides checking your pages’ main text content elements, you can also verify your images ALT descriptions in the “Elements” panel. Right-click on any image and select “Inspect,” as shown here: [Click to enlarge] 4. Identify no-indexation & canonicalization configuration in pages & resources You can also use Chrome’s DevTools to inspect your pages’ technical configuration. For example, you can validate the meta robots and canonical tags configuration, which can be done by using the “Search” drawer to look for these specific tags and review how they’re implemented. This validation can be done not only for the implementation of these tags in the HTML <head> area, but also in the HTTP headers, by going to the “Network” panel and selecting the desired page or resource to verify their header information, including the existence of a link rel=”canonical” in an image file, for example, as shown below. 5. Look for the HTTP status in the header configuration When checking the header configuration of the pages and resources using the “Network” panel, you can also verify their HTTP status and see if there are any redirects, which type of redirects they are, and error statuses, as well as the inclusion of other configurations such as the x-robots-tag, hreflang or the “vary: user agent” ones. 6. Validate your mobile web optimization by emulating any device Mobile-friendliness is now essential for SEO, and you can validate page configuration and content in mobile using the DevTools “Device Mode.” This option can be enabled by clicking the device icon in the upper left-hand area of the panel or by pressing Command+Shift+M (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+M (Windows, Linux) while the DevTools panel is open. Once in Device Mode, you will be shown viewport controls in the upper area of the window. Here, you can select a responsive viewport (freely resizable) or choose a specific device to test your page with. You can also add your own custom device using the “Edit…” option. 7. Assess your page load time & identify speed issues Analyze any page load time by emulating the network conditions and device used. For this, you can go to the “Network Conditions” tool, which you can access from the Customization menu in the upper right-hand corner of the panel under “More tools.” Here you will find the “Caching,” “Network throttling” and “User agent” configurations. Once you’ve chosen your settings, you can reload the desired page and go to the “Network” panel to see not only the page’s full load time (Load) but also when the initial markup of the page has been parsed (DOMContentLoaded), both of which appear at the bottom of the window. You can also view the load times and sizes of each one of the used resources, which can be recorded by clicking on the red button at the left side of the panel. To get recommendations of actions to take in order to improve the page speed performance, navigate to the “Audits” panel and click the “Run” button. Each recommendation will specify the related resources causing issues, as can be seen below: Additionally, you can capture screen shots of your page rendering with the “Filmstrip” option. By clicking on the camera icon and reloading the page, you can view screen shots of your page across various stages of loading, which allows you to verify what your users can see at every stage. 8. Identify render-blocking resources You can also use the resources load times data in the “Network” panel to identify which JS and CSS resources are loading before the DOM and potentially blocking it, which is one of the most common page speed issues. You can filter by CSS and JS by clicking the buttons for them (as shown below). 9. Look for non-secure resources during HTTPS migrations Chrome DevTools can be very helpful during HTTPS migrations, as it allows you to identify security issues in any page with the information provided in the “Security” panel. You can see if the page is secure and has a valid HTTPS certificate, the type of secure connection, and if there are mixed content issues due to non-secure origins of any used resource. 10. Validate your Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) implementation If you’re implementing AMP, you can see if there are any issues with your pages by adding “#development=1” string to your AMP URL, then checking in the “Console” panel. This will tell you if there are any issues, warnings or errors — and in which element and line of code these have been found so you can take the appropriate action to fix them. Bonus: Personalize Chrome DevTools settings As you can see, you can use Chrome DevTools for SEO in so many ways that you will likely spend some time in it. Thus, you might want to personalize it a bit based on your own preferences. You can adjust the appearance, enable shortcuts and more. You can do this in the “Preferences” settings, which can be found by clicking on the Customization menu button in the upper right-hand corner of the panel and choosing the “Settings” option. Last but not least, speaking of personalization of preferences: Analyzing minified code can make it difficult to parse, so make sure to click on the pretty print “{}” button in the central bottom area of the panel so you’re able to see a non-minified version. This will allow you to go through it easily due with improved readability. I hope these Chrome DevTools tips help to make your SEO life easier!

Samsung Details Its Own January Android Security Update GO The update should go live soon for eligible smartphones Jan 5, 2017 16:31 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  A few days ago, Google released the January security update for all compatible Nexus and Pixel devices. The search giant published the security bulletin that contains all the fixes provided by the update, as well as the factory images for those who don't want to wait for the OTA update. BlackBerry was the first non-Google OEM to start the rollout of January security update for its Android smartphones. The Canadian company added some of its own bug fixes that address specific issues found on BlackBerry smartphones powered by Android OS. Today, Samsung published its own Android Security Bulletin for the month of January, which contains an additional 28 Samsung vulnerabilities. Google's original update aimed at Nexus and Pixel devices contains a total of 95 fixes. Since OEMs are allowed to include their own, it makes sense for Samsung's January security update to contain even more patched vulnerabilities than Google's. As expected, Samsung confirmed once again that some of the Samsung vulnerabilities and exposures might not be included in this package if they were already added in a previous maintenance release. However, that's quite unlikely to happen. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge There's only one high-security issue that's been found in Samsung smartphones, which should be addressed in the patch. The exploit is said to affect Samsung handsets running Android 4.4 KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat, and it's been reported in early November. According to Samsung, the vulnerability discloses user credentials to sub-domain whenever users log in to an email account under certain conditions. So, the patch is meant to avoid disclosure by removing code sending user credentials. The rest of Samsung's vulnerabilities and exposures addressed in the January security update are of low and medium severity. It's unclear when the rollout of the update will start, but we believe it will be available for many Samsung smartphones in the next couple of days.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #January security update#Samsung update#Samsung vulnerability#Samsung exposure#Samsung security update subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Samsung Is Pushing Android 7.0 Nougat to Some Galaxy S7 Users BlackBerry Starts Rolling Out January Security Update for Its Android Phones Google Releases January Security Patch for Nexus and Pixel Devices LG Posts January Security Patch Details Ahead of Google It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements 2 photos    Samsung Galaxy S7 edge New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Qualcomm Says Nokia Phone Caught on Video at CES Is a Reference Design Device more on: Nokia 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

We round up the best phablets and large-screen phones you can buy in the UK in 2017. Best big phone reviews. Also see Best smartphones 2017 and Best tablets 2017. Also see: Best Phone Deals Many a time we've been guilty of reviewing a smartphone and blasting it for not fitting comfortably in the palm of your hand, or for requiring two hands for comfortable operation. But every one of us is different, and while some of us prefer our phones sleek and compact, others prefer them big and powerful.  Large-screen phones aren't useful only for those with poor eyesight or fat fingers, they're also a good fit for avid mobile gamers and those who watch a lot of video. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017 Generally speaking, a phablet (as they are known in the industry - a cross between phone and tablet) should be no less powerful than a standard smartphone. With more room inside the case they tend to have higher-capacity batteries, but you should also take into account that their larger screens may drain power faster than the smaller screens of phones with lower-capacity batteries. We class smartphones with screens of 5.5in-plus on the diagonal as phablets. Take into account that the number of pixels will be stretched over a larger screen area, so a Quad-HD screen will be appreciated here more than it would on a compact phone. That said, though, even a full-HD screen will look crystal clear on a big phone - just watch out for anything lower in resolution than this. Note that before you buy the Galaxy S7 edge in second place a new version is likely to be announced at next month's MWC 2017 - see our Galaxy S8 rumour round-up. Below we present our pick of the 20 best big phones you can buy in the UK in 2017. Read next: Best new phones coming in 2017 20 best big phones 2017 Content continues below 1. Xiaomi Mi Mix Rating: Reviewed on: 9 January 17 RRP: £799.91 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi Mix deals It might sound expensive, but the £799 Xiaomi Mi Mix actually offers very good value when you consider its meaty core hardware and generous 256GB of storage - it's certainly less than you'd pay for an iPhone 7 Plus. This isn't a phone you buy with budget in mind, however: the Mi Mix is the phone you buy when you want onlookers to say "Oh my gosh, what is that? It's amazing - I want one of those!" The Mi Mix is a revolutionary phone that we hope is a sign of things to come, with that gorgeous bezel-less display, beautiful ceramic body, fantastic performance, long, long battery life and all the other fancy tech we can't even pronounce, let alone understand. No matter - it works. Highly recommended. Read our Xiaomi Mi Mix review. 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £639 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 edge deals The Galaxy S7 edge is no longer the semi-gimmick it was before. Although some of the main features are things from the Galaxy S5 – Micro-SD and waterproofing – Samsung has given fans what they want. It's now a refined, sophisticated and highly desirable piece of technology. The battery isn't removable but the phone lasts longer than before and has seriously powerful specs under the hood. It has almost everything you could want from a phone even though the IR blaster is gone. We're also very impressed with the new camera and unless the screen is too big for you (despite some software features to help out) we think it's worth getting the S7 edge for the extra £70 with its gorgeous looks and extra functionality. Right now, this is the best smartphone money can buy. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review. 3. OnePlus 3T Rating: Reviewed on: 4 January 17 RRP: From £399 Buy from OnePlus Compare: all OnePlus 3T deals The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected. Read our OnePlus 3T review. 4. Huawei Mate 9 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £579.99 Compare: all Huawei Mate 9 deals Huawei’s Mate 9 is, in our opinion, the best in the Huawei line-up, boasting an impressively large battery alongside powerful internals, an improved dual-camera setup and a sleek, gorgeous design. The benchmark results were some of the best we've seen, bringing excellent value for money. EMUI 5 makes a huge difference to the overall experience too, and we can’t wait to see whether Huawei’s new technology will actually improve the performance of the smartphone over time. Read our Huawei Mate 9 review. 5. Google Nexus 6P Rating: Reviewed on: 28 April 16 RRP: From £449 inc VAT Compare: all Google Nexus 6P deals Originally, Nexus phones stood out for being excellent value at a price that was low, but not the lowest. They weren't an alternative to flagship phones, but they had the advantage of running stock Android and getting the next version more quickly. The 6P, though, is not only a flagship, but is arguably the best Android phone to buy at the moment. It won't suit everyone due to its size, nor those looking for a phone with dual-SIM slots or a removable battery. There's no support for wireless charging either. But the excellent screen, front-firing speakers, quick charging, great cameras, speedy performance and Android Marshmallow add up to make this a phone that's a pleasure to use. And yes, it's also cheaper than its rivals, so unless you think it's worth shelling out extra on the Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+ or iPhone 6S Plus, the Nexus 6P is the one to buy. Read our Google Nexus 6P review. 6. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 19 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB); £819 (128GB); £919 (256GB)   The iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent phone. It’s Apple’s best yet, but it is also Apple’s most expensive yet, with a huge starting price. In some respects, the upgrades seem to justify this, but at the same time some features are arguably only catching up with what the competition has been offering for a while now – water-resistance for one. Taken as a whole, the performance, battery life, camera quality and stereo speakers are all compelling reasons to upgrade. But our advice remains much the same as for the iPhone 7: if you already own the previous generation, there’s not enough here to justify ditching a 6S Plus, especially if you’re halfway through a two-year contract. Those just coming out of contract on the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus would do well to grab a 7 Plus.   Read our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review. 7. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £472.99 Buy from GearBest The Mi Note 2 was wrongly overshadowed at its launch. This is a gorgeous big-screen Android phone with very decent performance, a great camera and plenty of storage. We'd like to see a Quad-HD screen on Xiaomi's flagship phone, but this one should prove plenty sharp and clear. Google apps are not preinstalled, but there is a workaround if you are happy to do some tweaking. Read our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review. 8. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rating: Reviewed on: 15 October 15 RRP: £484.99 Buy from Samsung So, what do we think of the Galaxy Note 5? We’re very fond of just about every aspect of the Galaxy Note 5, from its curved and sleek design to its vibrant display and high-resolution camera. It can handle almost anything you can throw at it thanks to its CPU, GPU and 4GB of RAM and we experienced no lag during our testing. The only bad point is that the Note 5 would sometimes falsely detect the S Pen detaching – and to point out such a minor fault says a lot about the quality of the handset. With this being said, we’re both surprised and sad that the Galaxy Note 5 won’t be heading to UK shores any time soon. Read our Samsung Galaxy Note 5 review. 9. iPhone 6s Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 9 September 16 RRP: From £619 inc VAT The iPhone 6S Plus is a remarkable phone, and it's still a fantastic phone 12 months on. The 16GB model has finally been banished and the new minimum storage of 32GB should be workable for a lot of people. 3D Touch can sound gimmicky, but it’s absolutely not. It requires effort to force yourself to use it to begin with, but it quickly becomes second nature and app developers have put it to use in apps and games. Read our iPhone 6s Plus review. 10. Google Pixel XL Rating: Reviewed on: 24 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB) £819 (128GB) While the Pixel XL is an attractive phone (if you can get used to the glass section) with decent combination of hardware and software, we can't help but feel a bit disappointed. It's very similar to the much cheaper Nexus 6P and OnePlus 3. You can get plenty of other Android phones for less which have extra features like waterproofing and expandable storage. Sorry Google, but things have gone a bit wrong here. Read our Google Pixel XL review. 11. Huawei P9 Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £629 inc VAT If you’re in the market for a sleek, premium phablet with a great dual-camera setup, the Huawei P9 Plus is a great option. The 5.5in SuperAMOLED FHD display is bright and crisp, and shows off the detailed photos taken by the rear-facing dual 12Mp snappers. The processor is strong enough to compete with Samsung’s Galaxy S7, although it doesn’t quite compare in terms of graphical power. However, it’s worth noting that there aren’t huge differences between the P9 Plus and the flagship P9 so depending on what you want from the smartphone, it may be worth taking a look at the £100 cheaper Huawei P9. Otherwise, it’s a decent premium flagship that we’re impressed with. Read our Huawei P9 Plus review. 12. Xiaomi Mi Max Rating: Reviewed on: 29 June 16 RRP: £212.04 Buy from Xiaomi Tech If you want a huge phone and you don’t want to pay as large a wedge of cash, the Xiaomi Mi Max is a fantastic phablet with good looks, decent performance, strong runtime and, most importantly of all, a gigantic screen. Not ideal for novice users, but otherwise the Mi Max is a highly recommended smartphone. Read our Xiaomi Mi Max review. 13. LG G4 Rating: Reviewed on: 19 August 15 RRP: £500 inc VAT LG has gone down an unexpected route with leather models which we like apart from a couple of colours. The so called ceramic model will be cheaper but feels cheap and plasticky. On the whole, hardware is once again strong - particularly the camera - but not massively different from the G3 and has tough competition. We feel build quality could be better with a metal frame and dimensions going down, not the reverse. This is the flagship to go for if you want a removable battery and expandable storage but it's a shame to see features like wireless charging dropped. (Remember the G3 is now a steal at under £300 SIM-free and the OnePlus 2 is now here) Read our LG G4 review. 14. Xiaomi Redmi Pro Rating: Reviewed on: 21 September 16 RRP: £256.04 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest The Xiaomi Redmi Pro offers unbeatable value for money at around £250, undercutting every flagship yet offering much the same performance and many comparable features. Due to the lack of Google Play and a number of Chinese preinstalled apps we’d recommend Xiaomi phones only to seasoned Android users, however. Read our Xiaomi Redmi Pro review. 15. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 10 January 17 RRP: £192.93 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest The Redmi Note 4 isn’t a huge upgrade over the Redmi Note 3 in terms of core hardware, with simply a greater amount of storage and a faster processor, but the design changes are a huge improvement over its predecessor. If you don’t care about looks and can make do with less storage then the cheaper Redmi Note 3 may well meet your needs. The Redmi Note 4 remains a great buy, but the omission of Google Play support may put off some users. O2 and Giffgaff customers should also note the lack of support for 800MHz 4G. Read our Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review. 16. Elephone S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £177.11 Buy from TomTop The Elephone S7 is a very good-looking phone at an affordable price, with decent performance and a generous helping of storage. On the down side the cameras are disappointing and the rear panel is plastic. Even at this price you don't need to compromise so heavily. Read our Elephone S7 review. 17. Moto Z Play Rating: Reviewed on: 11 November 16 RRP: £379.99 inc VAT The Moto Mods accessories are the main reason to buy the Moto Z Play, but it's a decent mid-range phone regardless. For an affordable price Lenovo offers premium design, good specs and a well-rounded software experience. You only really need to splash out on the Moto Z for the Quad HD screen, Snapdragon 820 and OIS camera should you feel the need for those features (but also bear in mind the more expensive version has no headphone jack and a smaller battery). Read our Moto Z Play review. 18. Asus ZenFone 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 October 16 RRP: £284.05 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest The ZenFone 3 is a good all-round mid-range phone with decent performance and some nice extras under £300, but also a fair amount of bloatware. It's quite an update on the ZenFone 2, and definitely worth considering as an upgrade. Read our Asus ZenFone 3 review. 19. Google Nexus 6 Rating: Reviewed on: 14 December 15 RRP: £499 inc VAT (32GB); £549 inc VAT (64GB) There are some good things about the Nexus 6 including build quality and some top-end hardware such as the screen, processor and camera. However, it's simply too big, unwieldy and expensive to warrant awarding it anything higher than four stars and really get behind it (unless we wanted to hid from something). In the phablet market, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is simply better even if it is pricier and the excellent LG G3 at less than £300 is another thorn in the Nexus 6's side. Read our Google Nexus 6 review. 20. Apple iPhone 6 Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 21 September 15 RRP: £539 (16GB); £619 (64GB) When we initially wrote this review, the new size was something of an unknown. For many people the iPhone 6 (or iPhone 6S) is the better choice for the reasons we list in our iPhone 6 vs 6 Plus comparison. The truth is that a 5.5in screen isn't quite big enough to enable the 6 Plus to replace a tablet, yet the device is arguably too big and unwieldy as a smartphone. It will suit some people perfectly, especially if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games, while others will quickly see that it's not for them: it won't fit in their jeans pocket and demands two-handed operation much of the time. One thing is for sure: the iPhone 6 Plus is still expensive. If you're keen to buy one right now, we'd recommend against the 16GB model. And that leaves the 64GB at £619, but if you're already spending this much money, you may as well spend an extra £80 and get the 64GB iPhone 6S Plus. Or, if you can live with a smaller screen, the 64GB iPhone 6S also costs £619. Of course, there is another option: used or refurbished. If you can find a 64GB model at a good price in the refurbished section of Apple's website, it could be a tempting deal compared to the 6S or 6S Plus. Read our Apple iPhone 6 Plus review. 21. Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 19 July 16 RRP: £135 Vodafone’s Smart Ultra 7 in our opinion isn’t really an upgrade over the Smart Ultra 6. It’s £10 more expensive than the previous model and doesn’t really perform as well – the Smart 7 had worse benchmarking results than its predecessor in GFXBench, scoring 13fps compared to 14fps in T-Rex and 5.3fps compared to 5.7fps in Manhattan, although the Smart Ultra 7 bested the 6 in Geekbench 3 with results of 3002 compared to 2469. The camera, though the same on paper, seems to have had a slight downgrade too, producing rather washed out photos during testing. On the other hand, the 5.5in 1080p HD display is vibrant and crisp, and one must remember that the smartphone only costs £135 so if you are on a budget, it’s still a solid option.

So if you want a great deal on a smartphone, look no further than our round-up of the best Chinese phones 2017. Also see: Best Phone Deals You've probably heard of brands such as Huawei/Honor, ZTE and Lenovo, although you might not be aware that the latter makes phones as well as laptops. Xiaomi, too, is becoming increasingly popular worldwide, and is known as China's Apple. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017 But the problem with many Chinese phones is that they can be difficult to get hold of in the UK. To buy a Chinese phone in the UK you'll either need to look on a site such as eBay or Amazon, or go through a grey-market importer such as Geekbuying, GearBest or Coolicool. Be sure to read up on our grey-market tech buying advice before you do so. Should you buy a Chinese phone in the UK? Why you should and should not buy a Chinese phone Pros: • Excellent value for money • Competitive specification • Usually dual-SIM • None of your friends will have the same phone Cons: Content continues below • Without an official channel through which to purchase you may unintentionally buy a counterfeit product • Faulty devices may be difficult to return • You may incur import duty (charged at 20 percent of the value on the shipping paperwork plus an admin fee) • The phone may not work with your network (be sure to check before you buy) • Google Play may not be preinstalled (as is the case with some Xiaomi and Meizu phones) Best Chinese phone specifications: What to expect from a Chinese phone The majority of Chinese phones we've reviewed have been dual-SIM dual-standby. We've found this to be a standard feature of Chinese phones at any price point. However, in the case of Huawei/Honor phones, which are among those that are officially sold in the UK, the UK variant is often not dual-SIM. You should also check whether the second SIM slot is in addition to or replacing the phone's microSD slot. Also see: Best dual-SIM phones 2017 and dual-SIM buying advice. 4G is a common feature even at the lower price points. An increasing number of phones will support 4G on both SIM slots, but dual-standby phones will ask you to select one or the other for data. And while we're used to seeing phones that standardise on nano- or Micro-SIM, Chinese phones can occasionally still feature full-size SIM slots (though this is now becoming much less common). Of course, you can pick up an adaptor from somewhere like Amazon for as little as a pound. Also see: What is 4G? Complete guide to 4G. The fact that a Chinese phone supports 4G doesn't necessarily mean it will work on your UK network, mind. Always check a phone's frequency bands before purchase. In the UK we use LTE bands 3, 7 and 20, or look for 800-, 1800- and 2600MHz. EE operates on all three, Three on 800- and 1800MHz, O2 on 800MHz, and Vodafone on 800- and 2600MHz. Also see: How to tell if a phone is supported by your mobile network. MediaTek processors are a common feature within Chinese phones, and we're now beginning to see the deca-core Helio X20 in some Chinese phones. More often, though, the MediaTek processors inside Chinese phones are marketed as octa-core and 64-bit. Whereas many UK-sold octa-core flagships are sold with four cores tuned for performance and four for efficiency, here you'll usually find all eight cores running at the same speed; increasingly UK flagships now run quad-core chips from the Qualcomm Snapdragon family. Two- or even 3GB of RAM is not uncommon, and 4GB is often available as a top-end option, and expect to find 32GB of storage, with microSD support (often only to 32- or 64GB, rather than 128GB). Also see: What's the fastest smartphone 2017. Rather than NFC, phones with MediaTek processors often come with a feature called HotKnot. This works in a similar way, allowing you to do such things as share files and play multiplayer games with other HotKnot-capable phones. You will almost certainly also find a fingerprint scanner, and thankfully most are now touch- rather than swipe-style scanners. In the photography department a 13Mp Sony sensor with f/2.2 aperture is often found at the rear, while you'll usually get a 5Mp selfie camera at the front. The camera functionality is very similar to that of any other Android phone, but you may find the Face Beauty mode whitens your skin tone - the painting of a face white is a cultural tradition. There will be a slider somewhere that lets you turn off this effect. Also see: Best sounding phone 2017. A full-HD screen is common, with Quad-HD much less so and HD screens still found in the cheapest models, and we've reviewed many a 5.5in-screen Chinese phablet. The screen is usually a good-quality IPS panel, and may often be marketed as having 2.5D Arc glass or 3D glass. This does not mean the screen is curved, but rather that the edges of the screen are slightly curved (like on the iPhone 7). Gorilla Glass is another common feature, which is fortunate because getting hold of a case for a Chinese phone is just as involved as buying the phone itself (we advise getting one at the time of purchase, although you often find one is supplied in the box). Customisable gestures are not built into Android, but they are very common in Chinese phones. This means you are likely to be able to double-tap to wake the screen, and by drawing a letter onscreen in standby mode you will be able to launch an app of your choice. Many Chinese phones will also allow you to use gestures to trigger the camera shutter. While we're on the subject of software, be aware that some Chinese phones are sold rooted. For many people that's a bonus - for example UMI's Rootjoy app lets you easily install any OS you like - but it will put off some customers. We advise you to check whether wireless updates are available or if you will have to manually update the phone before you buy, if you think the latter may cause you grief. Best Chinese phones 2017 We've been reviewing Chinese phones supplied to us by Geekbuying, Coolicool and GearBest for a good couple of years now, but the honest truth is there are still many Chinese phones out there we have yet to review, and many, many Chinese phone manufacturers we've never even heard of. Some of those phones may deserve to join our list, but we won't recommend any Chinese phone we haven't physically held and tested. Over time we will build up our collection of Chinese phone reviews, and in the meantime we offer this chart not as a definitive guide to buying Chinese phones but as a guide to what you can expect for your money when you buy from China. If you've found a Chinese phone not listed in our chart then check its spec and compare it to the phones we've reviewed here. Read next: Best new phones coming in 2017.  Best Chinese phone reviews 1. OnePlus 3T Rating: Reviewed on: 4 January 17 RRP: From £399 Buy from OnePlus Compare: all OnePlus 3T deals The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected. Read our OnePlus 3T review. 2. Xiaomi Mi5s Rating: Reviewed on: 29 November 16 RRP: £282.75 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi5s deals We cannot recommend the Xiaomi Mi5s enough. This is the smartphone every 2016 flagship wanted to be, and it comes with a price tag half that of theirs. Fantastic build quality, fantastic performance, fantastic storage, battery and connectivity options - the Xiaomi Mi5s gets a big thumbs-up from us. Read our Xiaomi Mi5s review. 3. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £472.99 Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi Note 2 deals The Mi Note 2 was wrongly overshadowed at its launch. This is a gorgeous big-screen Android phone with very decent performance, a great camera and plenty of storage. We'd like to see a Quad-HD screen on Xiaomi's flagship phone, but this one should prove plenty sharp and clear. Google apps are not preinstalled, but there is a workaround if you are happy to do some tweaking. Read our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review. 4. Xiaomi Mi Mix Rating: Reviewed on: 9 January 17 RRP: £799.91 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi Mix deals It might sound expensive, but the £799 Xiaomi Mi Mix actually offers very good value when you consider its meaty core hardware and generous 256GB of storage - it's certainly less than you'd pay for an iPhone 7 Plus. This isn't a phone you buy with budget in mind, however: the Mi Mix is the phone you buy when you want onlookers to say "Oh my gosh, what is that? It's amazing - I want one of those!" The Mi Mix is a revolutionary phone that we hope is a sign of things to come, with that gorgeous bezel-less display, beautiful ceramic body, fantastic performance, long, long battery life and all the other fancy tech we can't even pronounce, let alone understand. No matter - it works. Highly recommended. Read our Xiaomi Mi Mix review. 5. Huawei Mate 9 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £579.99 Compare: all Huawei Mate 9 deals Huawei’s Mate 9 is, in our opinion, the best in the Huawei line-up, boasting an impressively large battery alongside powerful internals, an improved dual-camera setup and a sleek, gorgeous design. The benchmark results were some of the best we've seen, bringing excellent value for money. EMUI 5 makes a huge difference to the overall experience too, and we can’t wait to see whether Huawei’s new technology will actually improve the performance of the smartphone over time. Read our Huawei Mate 9 review. 6. Xiaomi Mi 5 Rating: Reviewed on: 31 May 16 RRP: £263.75 (plus import duty) Compare: all Xiaomi Mi 5 deals A fantastic Android flagship that comes in at an outrageously low price, the Xiaomi Mi 5 has the braun and the beauty to match the greats. Perhaps not a wise choice for first time Android users, but those comfortable in customising the setup will love the excellent-value, gorgeously designed Xiaomi Mi 5. Read our Xiaomi Mi 5 review. 7. Xiaomi Redmi Pro Rating: Reviewed on: 21 September 16 RRP: £256.04 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Redmi Pro deals The Xiaomi Redmi Pro offers unbeatable value for money at around £250, undercutting every flagship yet offering much the same performance and many comparable features. Due to the lack of Google Play and a number of Chinese preinstalled apps we’d recommend Xiaomi phones only to seasoned Android users, however. Read our Xiaomi Redmi Pro review. 8. Honor 8 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 September 16 RRP: £369.99 inc VAT Compare: all Honor 8 deals The Honor 8 is a fantastic smartphone, but the price has gone up from the Honor 7. In return for the additional expense you get a fantastic dual-camera, a sleek and stylish design, a faster fingerprint sensor and a beautiful display, which combined make the Honor 8 a worthy competitor to the OnePlus 3. Read our Honor 8 review. 9. Elephone S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £177.11 Buy from TomTop Compare: all Elephone S7 deals The Elephone S7 is a very good-looking phone at an affordable price, with decent performance and a generous helping of storage. On the down side the cameras are disappointing and the rear panel is plastic. Even at this price you don't need to compromise so heavily. Read our Elephone S7 review. 10. Elephone P9000 Rating: Reviewed on: 11 March 16 RRP: 193.98 (plus import duty from China) Compare: all Elephone P9000 deals We’re very impressed with the Elephone P9000, which is a great all-round Android phone at an unbelievable sub-£200 price. It’s fast, battery life is good, it’s feature-packed and it even runs Marshmallow. Wireless- and quick-charging-, NFC-, USB-C-, dual-SIM- and microSD support are the icing on the cake. Recommended. Read our Elephone P9000 review. 11. OnePlus 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 March 16 RRP: £249 64GB Compare: all OnePlus 2 deals The lack of NFC, a microSD card slot, a removable battery, and quick- and wireless charging means the OnePlus 2 is not a flagship killer. It does have some killer new features though, including USB Type-C, 4G dual-SIM support and some powerful hardware. At the reduced price of £249 (we don't recommend the 16GB OP2), it's an unrivalled deal. Read our OnePlus 2 review. 12. OnePlus X Rating: Reviewed on: 15 June 16 RRP: £189 (Onyx) Compare: all OnePlus X deals The OnePlus X was the best value smartphone of 2015. We love the premium design in a smaller form factor to the firm’s other phones. Software is a strong point and you get a gorgeous screen. However, cuts had to be made somewhere and the X is lacking features such as NFC, 11ac and Wi-Fi. It also is missing the fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C port found on the OnePlus 2. Battery life isn’t great and cameras aren’t best in class but this is a great phone for the price. Read our OnePlus X review. 13. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Rating: Reviewed on: 11 August 16 RRP: £100 Buy from Xiaomi Tech Compare: all Xiaomi Redmi 3S deals Right now the Redmi 3S Pro is available for just an extra £5 over the 3S, but ordinarily we would have said you will struggle to find better value for money than what is offered by Xiaomi's new Redmi 3S. This budget Android phone is feature-packed and capable, and has a new fingerprint scanner. You can't expect any more for £120, just remember that Google Play isn't installed out of the box. Read our Xiaomi Redmi 3S review. 14. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 10 January 17 RRP: £192.93 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 deals The Redmi Note 4 isn’t a huge upgrade over the Redmi Note 3 in terms of core hardware, with simply a greater amount of storage and a faster processor, but the design changes are a huge improvement over its predecessor. If you don’t care about looks and can make do with less storage then the cheaper Redmi Note 3 may well meet your needs. The Redmi Note 4 remains a great buy, but the omission of Google Play support may put off some users. O2 and Giffgaff customers should also note the lack of support for 800MHz 4G. Read our Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review. 15. Ulefone Future Rating: Reviewed on: 14 July 16 RRP: £188.57 inc. VAT Buy from Ulefone Compare: all Ulefone Future deals Ulefone has attempted to build a futuristic phone with the Future’s edge-to-edge display and USB-C port. For a mid-range Android phone performance is good, and the design is good, even if the phone is on the heavy side. We can’t turn a blind eye to the camera quality, although a software update should be able to fix the issues we saw. Read our Ulefone Future review. 16. Xiaomi Mi Max Rating: Reviewed on: 29 June 16 RRP: £212.04 Buy from Xiaomi Tech Compare: all Xiaomi Mi Max deals If you want a huge phone and you don’t want to pay as large a wedge of cash, the Xiaomi Mi Max is a fantastic phablet with good looks, decent performance, strong runtime and, most importantly of all, a gigantic screen. Not ideal for novice users, but otherwise the Mi Max is a highly recommended smartphone. Read our Xiaomi Mi Max review. 17. Lenovo ZUK Z1 Rating: Reviewed on: 6 November 15 RRP: £228.47 inc VAT (free shipping from EU warehouse) Compare: all Lenovo ZUK Z1 deals The Z1 is a good first attempt from ZUK. It's not a super-cheap budget phone, but we think the price is about right given the hardware inside. Standout features include the 5.5in full-HD screen, large battery, 64GB of built-in storage and USB-C port. Although there's no removable battery or microSD card support, you could argue that you need neither. Read our Lenovo ZUK Z1 review. 18. Xiaomi Redmi 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 2 February 16 RRP: £114.95 Compare: all Xiaomi Redmi 3 deals The Xiaomi Redmi 3 is a very decent budget Android phone, but it isn't intended for a UK audience and doesn't come with Google Play installed out of the box, so we wouldn't recommend it for those not familiar with Android. It has a plasticky but decent build, with good performance for the money.  Read our Xiaomi Redmi 3 review. 19. Meizu M3 Note Rating: Reviewed on: 19 June 16 RRP: £132.58 Buy from Meizu Compare: all Meizu M3 Note deals The Meizu M3 Note is a great phone, with outstanding battery life and a nice metal unibody design, but it isn’t a patch on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, which is faster and comes with a better camera, more up-to-date software and, importantly, a cheaper price tag. That said, it’s difficult for us to recommend to UK users (particularly novice UK users) the Meizu M3 Note over other budget Chinese smartphones we’ve tested, given that Google Play is not preinstalled and so much of it has not been adapted from Chinese.

The search giant is letting manufacturers add to more images, videos and descriptions to shopping search results and ads. While Google is still far from being an online retailer like Amazon, the update should help drive purchases of the 500 million products from 150,000 advertisers participating at any given time, according to Christian Santiago, Google's strategic partner development lead. show chapters Cramer: There's no way retailers can keep up with Amazon    Thursday, 5 Jan 2017 | 9:05 AM ET | 02:33 The feature, first announced in summer of 2015, aims to tame the duplicate and incomplete search results that often come along with data that comes directly from retailers, who each have their own product numbers and language, Santiago said. "We have heard from some brands, frankly, that they want to improve how their ads are in the Google ecosystem," Santiago said in a panel at CES in Las Vegas. "We'd rather get information directly from you. What's amazing is that so many manufacturers are depending on third-party retailers." Though Google is known for online search technology, shopping has been weak, and shrinking: 55 percent of U.S. consumers now start their shopping searches on Amazon, up from 44 percent the prior year, according to a BloomReach survey of 2,000 U.S. consumers over Labor Day weekend. Only 28 percent of respondents said they begin their product search with search engines like Google, down from 34 percent in the year-ago period. Retailers also saw their share of search shrink in 2016. Capturing more of the growing pool of online shoppers could be a huge opportunity for Google, said Lloyd Wood, who leads enterprise sales at market research firm GfK, a partner of Google. GfK data shows that 22 percent of returns are because the product received appears different that what was listed online. The Google Manufacturer Center opened for self-sign up on Tuesday. Google's "shopping" results will now favor manufacturer information if it is available. And if Amazon decides to participate, it will be treated just like any other retailer, Santiago said. "[Manufacturer Center] really tells a better story," Santiago said. "Fundamentally, I think a lot of this has to do with our desire to not only improve the shopping experience by also deliver a more structured, search-like experience."

Those devices cost around $100, which is very good for an up-to-date device. However, Google CEO Sundar Pichai doesn’t think $100 is good enough. Even $50 is too much. His goal is $30. “The right price point for smartphones in India is $30, and pursuing high quality smartphones at the price point will unlock it even more.” India currently has the largest base of Android users, and most of those users have phones that cost less than $150. Pichai went on to say that cheaper devices is only part of the solution. They also need services that can run reliably on “flaky” networks. He says Google is working on making more services adapt to slow internet. We love to talk about the latest and greatest high-end smartphones, but the fact is most people rely on these affordable devices. The cheaper we can get the tech, the more people can enjoy Android.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory It’s not often that any one of us needs to dial 911, but we know how important it is for it to work when one needs it. It is critical that 911 services always be available – both for the practicality of responding to emergencies, and to give people peace of mind. But a new type of attack has emerged that can knock out 911 access – our research explains how these attacks occur as a result of the system’s vulnerabilities. We show these attacks can create extremely serious repercussions for public safety. In recent years, people have become more aware of a type of cyberattack called “denial-of-service,” in which websites are flooded with traffic – often generated by many computers hijacked by a hacker and acting in concert with each other. This happens all the time, and has affected traffic to financial institutions, entertainment companies, government agencies and even key internet routing services. A similar attack is possible on 911 call centers. In October, what appears to be the first such attack launched from a smartphone happened in Arizona. An 18-year-old hacker was arrested on charges that he conducted a telephone denial-of-service attack on a local 911 service. If we are to prevent this from happening in more places, we need to understand how 911 systems work, and where the weaknesses lie, both in technology and policy. Understanding denial of service Computer networks have capacity limits – they can handle only so much traffic, so many connections, at one time. If they get overloaded, new connections can’t get through. The same thing happens with phone lines – which are mostly computer network connections anyway. So if an attacker can manage to tie up all the available connections with malicious traffic, no legitimate information – like regular people browsing a website, or calling 911 in a real emergency – can make it through. This type of attack is most often done by spreading malware to a great many computers, infecting them so that they can be controlled remotely. Smartphones, which are after all just very small computers, can also be hijacked in this way. Then the attacker can tell them to inundate a particular site or phone number with traffic, effectively taking it offline. Many internet companies have taken significant steps to guard against this sort of attack online. For example, Google Shield is a service that protect news sites from attacks by using Google’s massive network of internet servers to filter out attacking traffic while allowing through only legitimate connections. Phone companies, however, have not taken similar action. Addressing the 911 telephone system Before 1968, American emergency services had local phone numbers. People had to dial specific numbers to reach the fire, police or ambulance services – or could dial “0” for the operator, who could connect them. But that was inconvenient, and dangerous – people couldn’t remember the right number, or didn’t know it because they were just visiting the area. The 911 system was created to serve as a more universal and effective system. As it has developed over the years, a 911 caller is connected with a specialized call center – called a public safety answering point – that is responsible for getting information from the caller and dispatching the appropriate emergency services. These call centers are located in communities across the country, and each provides service to specific geographic regions. Some serve individual cities, while others serve wider areas, such as counties. When telephone customers dial 911 on their landlines or mobile phones, the telephone companies’ systems make the connection to the appropriate call center. To better understand how denial-of-service attacks could affect 911 call systems, we created a detailed computer simulation of North Carolina’s 911 infrastructure, and a general simulation of the entire U.S. emergency-call system. Investigating the impact of an attack After we set up our simulation, we attacked it to find out how vulnerable it is. We found that it was possible to significantly reduce the availability of 911 service with only 6,000 infected mobile phones – just 0.0006 percent of the state’s population. Using only that relatively small number of phones, it is possible to effectively block 911 calls from 20 percent of North Carolina landline callers, and half of mobile customers. In our simulation, even people who called back four or five times would not be able to reach a 911 operator to get help. Nationally, a similar percentage, representing just 200,000 hijacked smartphones, would have a similar effect. But this is, in a certain sense, an optimistic finding. Trey Forgety, the director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, responded to our findings in the Washington Post, saying, “We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated.” Policy makes the threat worse These sorts of attacks could, potentially, be made less effective if malicious calls were identified and blocked at the moment they were placed. Mobile phones have two different kinds of identifying information. The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is the phone number a person must call to reach that phone. The IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) is used to track the specific physical device on the network. A defense system could be set up to identify 911 calls coming from a particular phone that has made more than a certain number of 911 calls in a given period of time – say more than 10 calls in the last two minutes. This raises ethical problems – what if there is a real and ongoing emergency, and someone keeps losing phone reception while talking to a dispatcher? If they called back too many times, would their cries for help be blocked? In any case, attackers who take over many phones could circumvent this sort of defense by telling their hijacked phones to call less frequently – and by having more individual phones make the calls. But federal rules to ensure access to emergency services mean this issue might be moot anyway. A 1996 Federal Communications Commission order requires mobile phone companies to forward all 911 calls directly to emergency dispatchers. Cellphone companies are not allowed to check whether the phone the call is coming from has paid to have an active account in service. They cannot even check whether the phone has a SIM card in place. The FCC rule is simple: If anyone dials 911 on a mobile phone, they must be connected to an emergency call center. The rule makes sense from a public safety perspective: If someone is having (or witnessing) a life-threatening emergency, they shouldn’t be barred from seeking help just because they didn’t pay their cellphone bill, or don’t happen to have an active account. But the rule opens an vulnerability in the system, which attackers can exploit. A sophisticated attacker could infect a phone in a way that makes it dial 911 but report it does not have a SIM card. This “anonymized” phone reports no identity, no phone number and no information about who owns it. Neither the phone company nor the 911 call center could block this call without possibly blocking a legitimate call for help. The countermeasures that exist, or are possible, today are difficult and highly flawed. Many of them involve blocking certain devices from calling 911, which carries the risk of preventing a legitimate call for help. But they indicate areas where further inquiry – and collaboration between researchers, telecommunications companies, regulators and emergency personnel – could yield useful breakthroughs. For example, cellphones might be required to run a monitoring software to block themselves from making fraudulent 911 calls. Or 911 systems could examine identifying information of incoming calls and prioritize those made from phones that are not trying to mask themselves. We must find ways to safeguard the 911 system, which protects us all.

Video provided by AFP Newslook Crowds gather to see a BMW concept vehicle at the BMW Group news conference Wednesday at CES in Las Vegas. (Photo: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation) LAS VEGAS — Not that long ago, checking in on the state of self-driving car technology meant asking Google's engineers how they were doing. The search company was virtually alone on the autonomous car highway. But in the last four years, that road has gotten crowded. The Consumer Electronics Show has served as a leading indicator of the growing interest in self-driving tech, eventually welcoming to what traditionally was a gadget-fest more than a dozen automakers. Two years ago, Ford CEO Mark Fields even delivered the keynote, a spotlight previously reserved for the likes of Bill Gates. This year, CES, which wraps here Sunday, again puts a spotlight on the mounting competition between not just the automakers but also the suppliers vying to provide the high-tech components that allow vehicles to navigate through a world of obstacles. It's clear now that engineers are able to make cars drive themselves. The bigger issue is how to scale this technology in a way that finds it both culturally embraced and scientifically sound — and is cost effective. As tech companies such as Nvidia, Intel, Harman join major auto brands such Audi, BMW and Volvo — 500 auto-tech companies large and small came to CES this year — in showing off their chips, sensors and smart cars, one has to wonder if this is a winner-take-all contest or if we're creating competing standards that could delay the arrival of a self-driving future. "There's a lot of desire to be the ones who can get there first and monetize this market for self-driving cars and it's causing almost a frenetic activity across the automotive industry, both from automakers and from tech companies," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. If the various self-driving car booths here had a singular mission, it was to showcase how much safer the driving world can be thanks to technology. Delphi's Mary Gustanski explains the display inside a self-driving Audi SUV in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive gave reporters rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. Its self-driving system was developed with sensors made by Mobileye and chips from Intel that automatically avoided a collision without input from its driver. "I see the potential for zero accidents and mobility for all simply because drivers have been taken out of the transportation equation," said Doug Davis, who leads Intel's automated driving group. Many automakers have set an eventual goal of zero deaths in their vehicles, remarkable considering that 30,000 die each year in the U.S. and more than a million worldwide. The competition to produce technology that can help car companies reach that milestone is intensifying quickly. AT&T, Intel, Nvidia: latest names in self-driving AT&T announced at CES that it was working with Delphi and Ford on improving vehicle communication with other cars and infrastructure. AT&T is also building a self-driving test center in Michigan with the American Center for Mobility. Intel and Mobileye are working with BMW to deploy 40 self-driving BMWs by the second half of 2017, the companies said here Wednesday. Intel, which announced that it plans to invest in high-definition mapping-firm Here, also is developing autonomous driving hardware and software platforms that could serve as a standard for other innovators to adopt. Meanwhile, Intel competitor Nvidia announced at CES Wednesday that it had landed Germany's ZF Group as its first customer for a car-computing platform powered by its chips that boasts both machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. Big names in the chip game such as Qualcomm and AMD are also in the hunt. "We are going to see cars become the next major platform to battle over for the semiconductor makers," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. USA TODAY Nvidia aims to spread Google AI through home USA TODAY Faraday Future's electric car gets a face and a name: FF 91 Samsung, too, became a major player in car connectivity and autonomous driving with its November $8 billion acquisition of Harman, which has its own auto tech expertise and relationships with automakers. "It is by far the hottest area in terms of tech," O'Donnell said. In Harman's demonstration area at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the company showed off all the various aspects of autonomous vehicles, including smart ride-sharing cars that adapt the car's settings, display and personal audio zones based on riders' profiles. Harman's holographic augmented reality display proof of concept for autonomous vehicles on display at the CES in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Harman) Another self-driving car Harman showcased offers riders a fully-immersive IMAX-style projection and sound system. Also on display was cybersecurity software to protect your car from hackers. Harman's partners in its autonomous car-tech quest include Apple, Daimler Chrysler, Google, IBM and Microsoft. All this collaboration would seem to bode well, but the truth is even those deeply enmeshed in the self-driving car world believe there are many miles to be driven before the masses enjoy this breakthrough. "No one company can do everything," said Dinesh Paliwal, Harman CEO and Chairman. Even though, "the autonomous car is almost here, we are 10 to 15 years out from the day when you have the majority of the cars with smarts that interact with each other through the cloud." In the meantime, expect auto-tech breakthroughs to trickle down into new vehicles in the form of increasingly sophisticated driver-assist features, just as driver-assisted parking and automatic braking have so far. USA TODAY Toyota car gives driver an artificial intelligence buddy And along the way, some companies may fall to the wayside, as did some in the transition from traditional cell phones to today's smartphones. "The next 10 years is going to be as influential in the car and personal transportation world as the smartphone has been in the past ten years," Autotrader's Brauer said. "You are going to see companies disappear because they can't adapt quickly enough." O'Donnell agrees and expects the industry to coalesce around multiple approaches. "It's an exciting area and it’s clear no one owns it. Frankly, it's big enough there may be multiple players."

Chromebooks -- inexpensive laptops running Google's limited Chrome OS -- used to feel very cookie-cutter. Every brand made one or two, but they were all pretty much the same. With work and play shifting to online, cloud-based tools such as Gmail, Netflix and Facebook help Chromebooks feel less restrictive now, since all these online apps can be reached with the Chrome browser at the heart of the OS. Sarah Tew/CNET The new Samsung Chromebook Pro, and its sister product, the Chromebook Plus, take that a step further, and both were built in collaboration with Google to emphasize Google's Play app store. Like a handful of newer Chromebooks, these can run Android apps from the Play store, and even run multiple apps at the same time. That gives you access to a huge software library previously unavailable on Chrome OS, including games and the Android versions of products from the likes of Adobe. 28 Samsung Chromebook Pro and Chromebook Plus Both the Pro and Plus are hybrids, with 360-degree hinges and a built-in stylus for drawing and note taking. Google's Keep app is preinstalled for stylus-based notes and handwriting-to-text conversion. The 12.3-inch displays have a better-than-HD 2,400x1,600-pixel resolution and a Gorilla Glass top layer. The 32GB of internal storage and 4GB of RAM is standard for Chromebooks, but these are meant to be primarily cloud-based tools. In my hands-on time with the systems, they had a premium feel both in design and speed, and the included stylus worked well for some quick sketching. Most Chromebooks are make of plastic -- these have all-metal bodies, and feel closer to some of the ultrathin Windows laptops and hybrids we've tested recently (which are much more expensive). Sarah Tew/CNET The two versions -- the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus -- look identical, down to the USB-C ports on either side. The difference is in the processor. The Pro has an Intel Core M3, from Intel's sixth-generation Core i-series, while the Plus has an ARM chip, typically found in phones and Android tablets. The Plus version is coming in February at $449 (£365 or AU$620 converted), while the Pro version is coming later this spring and doesn't have an official price yet. 50 All the cool new gadgets at CES 2017 Editors' Top Picks See All Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Starting at: $1,649.99 Apple's Touch Bar -- a thin screen that replaces the function keys on the new MacBrook...

Amazon, Microsoft, and Google could be to blame. By Matt Asay | January 5, 2017, 6:39 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/monsitj NoSQL has been on a tear for years, but that momentum seems to have slowed. From 2013 to 2015, the hottest NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Apache Cassandra roughly doubled in popularity, as shown in DB-Engines database ranking data. In 2016, however, they essentially flatlined. This isn't to say they're not extraordinarily popular. They are, as a quick look at job postings suggests. Though lesser NoSQL lights hit their potential long ago, the best NoSQL databases continue to climb. The problem, however, is that developers increasingly want their NoSQL served in the cloud by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This has been evident for some time, but it wasn't clear until now just how much it was hurting the popularity of more terrestrial databases. Growing, growing, and then not so much DB-Engines just released rankings for January 2017, with three NoSQL databases making the top-10 (MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis). That's the good news. DB-Engines The bad news is that this 2017 number isn't much different from late 2015: DB-Engines Over the past year, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis have hardly added to their late 2015 totals, totals that had me writing that NoSQL threatened to usurp Oracle's database reign. True, Oracle (and IBM's DB2) spent 2016 on the skids, even as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Postgres all grew significantly more popular. SEE: Why some of the fastest growing databases are also the most experimental But, look at October 2013: DB-Engines See the problem? Between 2013 and 2015, MongoDB and Cassandra (just out of the top-10 view in the 2013 rankings) both grew at the expense of Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft, more than doubling in popularity (measured by a weighted amalgamation of job postings, Google searches, Stack Overflow mentions, and several other data points). What happened? Assimilation and cloud One way to explain this apparent lull in NoSQL's rise is that the traditional RDBMSes have added enough NoSQL-like functionality to nudge some buyers into giving Oracle et al. a chance to get their NoSQL acts together. Given how clumsy these efforts are, however, something more is in play. That something is the cloud, and it's being driven by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. If you look at the relative growth of Amazon DynamoDB, for example, or Microsoft's DocumentDB, the growth is staggering. Even more impressive, however, is the growth behind these same companies' cloudy RDBMSes like Amazon Aurora—it's off the charts. SEE: Why cloud databases threaten Oracle's lead in the enterprise It would be easy to argue this growth away, saying it's just a reflection of starting from a small user base. That's true, to a point. But, given that these same databases are rapidly nearing the top-20 most popular databases globally, that point doesn't extend very far.

Given that an increasing amount of this data lives in the cloud, coupled with the fact that public cloud services can make it much easier to adopt and get productive with that data, it's no wonder that developers are flocking to AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to claim even more benefits than an on-premises NoSQL database can provide. Companies like MongoDB have stepped up their cloud game with their own database-as-a-service offering, which is essential to their long-term success. Developers, however, are settling in with a select few public cloud providers and are going to default to the database offerings they provide. Is it game over for the traditional NoSQL databases? No. But there are clear signs that they need to significantly up their game in 2017 if they want to be anything more than the winners of yesterday's popularity contests.

The Axon 7, ZTE’s flagship in Canada, will get an update to Android 7.0 Nougat by end of January or early February, assuming Google certifies the device in time. That update would also make the phone compatible with Google’s Daydream View VR headset, marking the first time ZTE truly enters the VR space. A demo of the Axon 7 loaded with Nougat and nestled into the View, presented an experience that seemed the same as the Pixel or Moto Z, more or less. Without spending more time to gauge performance over a longer stretch, it’s hard to say how on par it will be with other, more powerful devices expected to be Daydream-ready in the coming months. As for what’s new, the device the company hyped most was the Hawkeye, a crowdsourced effort called Project CSX (Crowd Source X), courtesy of four winners from Iraq who beat out thousands of other contestants to conceptualize and design the phone. The unit at ZTE’s CES 2017 press conference was only a non-working prototype showing the basic design. And being in a glass case meant I couldn’t get my hands on it to feel what it was like. On the surface, it’s a nice-looking phone, and the lime green back is unusual, yet interesting at the same time (the final colours haven’t been settled). Specs and other details weren’t revealed at the event, other than a 5.5-inch display, but the pricing indicates it will be well within the mid-range. The ideas and design had to fit within a certain cost-conscious budget, so the premise here was not to make a high-end, flagship-style handset. Another first — ZTE will sell the phone through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for $199 USD to early backers, who can expect the Hawkeye to ship in Q3 later this year. Canadians are eligible to pledge as early backers. The company was mum on any other plans for availability beyond the campaign. Whether or not the Hawkeye will be sold in retail or through carriers at some point is completely unknown at this time. The one feature ZTE is pushing with Hawkeye is what it calls Senseye, eye-tracking technology that automatically scrolls up, down or across based on where the eye is looking. This works in tandem with an adhesive case that would come bundled with the phone to stick to any surface like a wall-mounted TV. The idea is that Senseye would be very handy in hands-free or one-handed situations, like in the kitchen or holding onto a support bar on a subway train or bus, for example. Then there’s the Blade V8 Pro, a device and product line that is entering the American market for the first time. Axon has been the focus in Canada and the U.S., and bringing in a Blade device doesn’t appear to change that. The Blade V8 Pro is available for pre-order now, shipping only in the U.S. starting January 18thfor an outright price of $229.98 USD. Canadians are not able to order it and have it shipped to the Great White North, and there is no word on if the phone will even cross the border or not. It may be fair to assume that ZTE will test the waters in the much larger market down south before opting to release it in Canada, but that’s all speculation at this point. Spending some hands-on time with the device felt like it was an Axon by another name, except it does stand out in some respects. It sports a 5.5-inch 1920 x 1080 pixel display and Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, microSD slot, plus a dual 13 megapixel rear camera setup in keeping with a blooming theme here at the show. The home button doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The battery inside is a respectable 3,140mAh, which should perform well with these specs. The back is more rubberized for better grip, and photos do appear very decent from my limited hands-on time. For the price, it comes off as a stiff competitor, but time will tell if gets to compete in Canada.

I think you are referring to “Daydream VR” that is baked into Nougat.

The company announced retail partnerships with BMW and Gap Inc. to use its augmented reality (AR) platform Project Tango and work towards creating a shopping experience in which shoppers do not need to be physically present at the retail outlet, but they can choose products as if they were. “We see a lot of use of this technology in retail, for measuring your garage or buying big-ticket items like kitchens for example,” Eric Johnsen, business development executive, augmented reality at Google, spoke at CES in Las Vegas on Wednesday, where the deals were announced. Tango uses computer vision comprising of technologies such as 3D mapping, motion-tracking and AR instead of GPS to help devices sense their environments. Google’s technology venture will use cameras and sensors in smartphone to create digital images in physical spaces, the best example of which is the AR game Pokémon Go. While Google’s deal with Gap Inc. will help consumer shop in Gap stores just like they would usually do — checking out and trying out merchandize, its deal with BMW is a little different. With BMW, Google is trying out an AR app which will display its i3 and i8 cars on smartphone screens. Car buyers will be able to check out superimposed vehicles and will not just be able to choose from different colors, trims and wheels but will also be able to place a high-resolution image of the vehicle inside their garage or driveway. BMW says that the app will be available at dealerships globally. Related Articles VR/AR Trends Expected In 2017 Is Augmented Reality Apple's Next Big Project?

Tom Regan, @grapedosmil 01.05.17 in Business Comments 1132 Shares Share Tweet Share Save The U.S Department of Labor is suing Google after the company declined to share employment data with the government. In its complaint, the department claims that Google refused to reveal employee salaries and benefits to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) during a routine anti-discrimination audit. The OFCCP is now seeking a court order to force the tech giant to comply. With Google systems helping government departments, the company is technically a federal contractor. This means the tech firm legally has to share compliance data in order to prove it operates in accordance with equal employment laws. Google, however, claims that sharing such information is a breach of privacy and could "reveal confidential data". With the tech company claiming to have shared "hundreds of thousands" of other reports with the government, its reluctance to let the OFCCP see its employee's salaries is surprising. However, Google's record regarding employee diversity and equal opportunities isn't exactly stellar. A recent employment audit also revealed troubling information about tech company Palantir, which was accused of using an algorithm that discriminated against Asian applicants. If Google continues to refuse to cooperate, the OFCCB has threatened to ask the court to cancel the company's current government contracts and prevent it from signing any new ones.

Despite having one of the best cloud back-end technology, a robust suite of productivity apps and a leadership in AI and machine learning technologies, Google hasn't been viewed as a 'textbook' enterprise focussed company. But in 2016, it has turned a leaf. It hired Alphabet board member and former VMware co-founder Diane Green, who in Silicon Valley has been known as the queen of enterprise. In the last year, Google has formed an integrated cloud division which doesn't only include its data centre cloud division but also includes business offerings of its collaborative apps - Google Docs, Sheets and Slides and also Maps. This division is also the enterprise front end for its Android and Chrome OS platforms. This division not only attracts customers to switch to the Google Cloud platform, but also dangles the carrot of Google's apps and its devices - Chromebooks and all. Under Greene, Google is incredibly serious about the enterprise and it is going to be big threat to Microsoft which dominates this kind of a market owing mostly to its legacy customers, its marketshare in deploying enterprise software and tools and its lead over Google in customer cloud computing. This desire wasn't there before Greene joined. Or perhaps it can be argued that Pichai was elevated to CEO, Google didn't have the inclination nor had the right attitude to tackle enterprise despite perceivably having one of the best technologies. This has changed and even in developing markets like India, Google intends to take on the likes of Microsoft head on. The Digital Unlocked programme which was announced by Sundar Pichai on January 4, 2017, can be seen as an example of the enterprise focus at Google. On the face of it, this is a programme that is geared towards bringing online small Indian businesses online. But what happens once these vendors are brought online and they taste success. This programme will become a gateway for these SMBs to use Google's services, instead of Microsoft. Microsoft actually took the lead in 2015 when it announced that its Azure Cloud Service will open a local cloud region in India. It was soon followed by the likes of Amazon and IBM and only now in 2017 Google will open one region of its own. Microsoft has been doubling down on this 'mobile first, cloud first' mantra since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in February 2014. Regardless, it also had the advantage of being the quintessential enterprise company having a relationship with its customers for years, even in India. In India, Microsoft struggles a lot with piracy, even with its new subscription services like Office 365. The combined cost and complexity of its services mean that they aren't ideal for small scale businesses (SMBs) like the ones Google is targeting. Google India chief Rajan Anandan claimed that India has 51 million SMBs and only 32 percent of them are digital. This marks a huge opportunity for Google. Combined with programmes like Digital Unlocked and Google My Business, there is a potential for a lot of businesses to convert to Google apps now called the G Suite from the Google Cloud. For large businesses it is an opportunity to shift to Google's Cloud infrastructure which many believe to be one of the best around considering it helps scale 7 businesses owned by Google used by over a billion people. Apps like Snapchat and Evernote are already on Google's Cloud and Niantec's smash hit Pokemon Go scaled and managed so many users just because it was on the Google Cloud. In the Indian context, in the wake of demonetisation, Walnut an app that helps people find an ATM nearby with cash scaled quickly using Google's cloud backend. It can be argued that even Amazon or Microsoft's solutions could've facilitated the same - but as Google bundles Maps, G Suite Apps and a state-of-the-art cloud backend which leverages machine learning, makes its allure quite strong. "Small business which are online have 52 percent of the customers are outside their city," said Rajan Anandan, MD Google India. The pie is quite large and Google's offering are relatively more affordable for small businesses. For instance, a Chromebook is more secure than a Windows notebook and it is also cheaper. In fact, Chrome OS can be adapted to an old Windows machine breathing new life in it -- all one needs is a monitor, a keyboard and mouse and a LAN connection. If using programmes like Digital Unlocked and Google My Business, Google can establish a direct link with small to medium businesses, then it will pose massive threat to Microsoft and some other companies in the enterprise space in India.

WIRE Lawsuit Seeks to Ban Google From Government Contracts Google was supposed to be giving the feds hiring and compensation data. It has not.. By Michael Liedtke Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The U.S. Labor Department is trying to bar Google from doing business with the federal government unless the internet company turns over confidential information about thousands of its employees. The potential banishment is being sought in a Labor Department lawsuit filed Wednesday with the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The complaint alleges that Google has repeatedly refused to provide the Labor Department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure the company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race. The review of how Google pays the thousands of workers at its Mountain View, California, headquarters is allowed under decades-old laws regulating U.S. government contractors. Google has struck a series of deals with various federal government agencies during the past decade, including a digital advertising agreement cited by the Labor Department that has generated more than $600,000 for the company since June 2014, according to the complaint. That amount is a pittance for Google, whose revenue has surpassed $130 billion during the same span. If Google doesn't comply with all its demands, the Labor Department wants a legal order that would void all of the company's current federal government contracts and block future deals. In a statement, Google said it has provided hundreds of thousands of records in an attempt to comply with the Labor Department's requests, but has rebuffed some of the agency's demands as "overbroad" and an invasion of employee privacy. Like most other big technology companies, Google for the past few years has been posting breakdowns of its workforce that show most of its computer programmers and other high-paid employees in technical jobs are white and Asian men. The disclosures have become a source of embarrassment for Google and its technology industry peers, who have repeatedly acknowledged they need to do more to hire women, blacks and Hispanics. "We're very committed to our affirmative action obligations, and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues," Google reiterated in its response to the Labor Department's lawsuit. But Google, which is part of Alphabet Inc., and other tech companies so far have only been disclosing the types of jobs held by the two genders and different races without providing specifics about the salaries in different employment categories. It is well known, though, that programmers and engineers who write the coding for technology products and services are among the highest paid workers besides the companies' executives. The Labor Department maintains that Google agreed to submit to a higher level of scrutiny when it decided to do business with federal agencies funded by taxpayers. "Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation," said Thomas Dowd, acting director of the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. --Associated Press Published on: Jan 5, 2017 Advertisement

The Chromebook Pro and its stablemate, the Chromebook Plus, share several defining features. Both devices are convertibles, folding through 360 degrees to become chunky tablets or into 'tent mode' for watching Netflix. Both are equipped with a metal digitiser pen, and both are capable of running Android apps, pushing the Chromebook's capabilities beyond ordinary web apps. What sets the two devices apart are their processors. The Pro comes with an Intel Core m3 processor, the m3-6Y30 to be precise, which is a sixth-generation part with a clock speed of 900MHz that can Turbo Boost to 2.2GHz when required. The Plus, on the other hand, is an ARM-based device, running on the hexa-core OP1 processor. The presence of the stylus shoves Samsung's Chromebook in the direction of other professional-grade devices, such as Microsoft's Surface Book, Lenovo's ThinkPad Yoga X1 and the iPad Pro. Samsung vice president Alanna Cotton claimed the stylus is perfect for jotting notes on the 12.3in 2,400 x 1,600 LED display. We're not sure we'd go that far. In our brief tests with the ARM-based Chromebook Plus, the stylus was responsive, without ever getting close to emulating the feel of a real pen and paper -- it's not in the same class as more expensive rivals such as the Surface Book or Yoga X1. That's partly down to the glossy coating of the screen, which has a slightly sticky texture. The lightweight plastic casing of the Chromebook also doesn't feel great in the hand. Google's note-taking app, Google Keep, is pre-installed on the Chromebooks, which uses optical character recognition to transcribe handwritten notes jotted with the stylus. The pen itself has a 0.7mm nib, which is thinner than many other styluses on the market, and docks in the base of the laptop, just beneath the right-hand corner of the screen. The ability to download and install Android apps is another boon for professional users, with dedicated apps usually offering more features and better offline support than the web-based apps that Chromebooks have traditionally depended upon. Google began offering support for Android apps on selected models of Chromebooks late last year, and it now looks set to become a standard feature of the latest generation of devices. Both the Samsung Chromebooks have 32GB of onboard e.MMC storage, with the option to supplement that further via the MicroSD slot. The Chromebook Plus is set to go on sale from February for $449 (around £365). The Pro will arrive later in the year, for an as yet unannounced price, although it's safe to assume it will be the more expensive of the two models. Hot question While Samsung used its CES keynote to showcase several new products including the Chromebooks, a minor refresh of its Notebook 9 (for the US market only) and other domestic appliances, it didn't duck the Galaxy Note 7 issue that has been hanging over the company since the end of last year. Tim Baxter, president and COO of Samsung Electronics America, kicked off the keynote by admitting 2016 had been a "challenging year" for the company. He later said the company would "very soon be sharing the root-cause report on the Note 7", having spent the past couple of months working with third-party experts and the company's own engineering teams to work out what had caused the supersized smartphones to overheat.

Google today announced that Assistant is coming to Android TV. While the company did not provide an exact release date for the added functionality, merely stating that its personal assistant will become available on Android TVs running Android 6.0 and above “in the coming months,” it did promise that users will soon be able to use their voice to interact with their TVs in a variety of ways. For instance, saying something like “Play Stranger Things on Netflix,” will queue up the popular series. Alternatively, asking a question like “Tell me about Jurassic Park” will take the user to the movie’s Wikipedia page. That’s just some of the functionality coming to Android TVs courtesy of Assistant. That said, Canadians may end up having to wait longer than their cousins to the south to start using Assistant on their Android TV. Regarding availability, Google says: “In the coming months, the Google Assistant on Android TV will come to the Nvidia Shield, along with all Android TVs in the US running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or Android 7.0 Nougat…” While finding a Canadian retailer that has Nvidia Shield stock available to purchase is near impossible, the set top box did, in fact, make its way to Canada. Moreover, Nvidia announced today that the newest iteration of the Shield will ship to Canada this month (MobileSyrup will have more on that later today). As such, we’ve reached out to Google to find out if Assistant will be available in Canada via the Nvidia Shield. We’ll update this article once we hear back from the company. Stay tuned. The company also announced that Assistant will come to other Google-developed platforms like Android Wear 2.0 and Android Auto, though once again the search giant did not provide a timeline for when its personal assistant will make the leap to those platforms. Update 2017/01/05: Google has informed MobileSyrup that even on the Nvidia Shield the rollout of Google Assistant to will be limited to U.S.-based Android TV devices.

Since then, its near impossible to find any stock however I do notice that there is already the capability to talk to Shield via the remote to pull up programs and content already. Adding Google search capability is just an added bonus for sure. DownwithRobellus I’m so glad to hear that Google kept quiet at this year’s CES because they should be focusing on bringing Android Pay world wide, fixing hangouts, ensuring other manufacturers try to stick close to the pure android experience, resolving bugs in 7.0 and making a road map of supporting their devices (ie. Nexus 6). I feel like this billion dollar company just half asses everything they throw their money at. Google Wallet didn’t work so let’s do a name change and try again….just stop it already! thereasoner Google Wallet worked great, it was carriers and banks that weren’t yet supporting it. As for Android Pay, I’m sure that it’s the ridiculous amount of NFC capable Android phones out there that are slowing and complicating the adoption process with the banks. The list of supported devices should be interesting to see when it does come about. Smanny Google’s Assistant will be in Android Wear 2.0. Arman Really good! Brad Fortin Is this going to be the version of Google Assistant that’s currently exclusive to the Pixel, the version of Google Assistant that’s currently on Google Home, or the version of Google Assistant that’s currently in the Allo app? Or is this going to be a new version of Google Assistant? dougo13 No CANADA again? What is the problem THIS time??

Image: EPA By Sohini Mitter2017-01-05 15:03:08 UTC Google CEO Sundar Pichai feels that India adopts "remarkably" fast to new products and services. And it is the country's "thirst and hunger" for connectivity that is the driving force.   SEE ALSO: Google plans to get India's 51 million SMBs online with 'Digital Unlocked' "We realize when we build for India, we can actually take it globally," Pichai told a local television station during his ongoing visit.  Google has developed many services in India — YouTube Offline, for instance — and then taken them worldwide.  Pichai says the video service was "made to work offline in India, and is now working well in other places."  He added that Google is working on YouTube Go, a service that would function smoothly on slower internet networks.  An offline version of Google Maps is also being tested in India. Calling India "a quick-test market" in another interview, Pichai said he sees the country's cash transition as an "exciting opportunity".  "We're thinking hard about how to adapt to a cashless India. We might bring services from Google on top of UPI that will make make payments easier," he said.  India, which is currently riding a smartphone boom, is at a "tipping point," said Pichai. And for him, to make Google relevant in this phase will "make it effective elsewhere as well." Pichai's interest in India is not new. During his last visit in early 2016, Google had announced free Wi-Fi services across 400 Indian railway stations.  That ambitious plan is slowly and steadily taking shape as 100-plus busy stations are now equipped with Google Wi-Fi.   And the Indian-born Pichai wants more.  BONUS: Google Earth Timelapse shows how man has altered the planet in 32 years   Topics: Apps and Software, Dev & Design, engineering, Gadgets, Google, Mobile, payments, Product, Sundar Pichai, Tech, YouTube About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google Assistant’s presence in Allo and Google Home was just the beginning. The search giant this week announced its smart new AI platform, famed for its ability to understand context, is making its way to more devices in the near future. Starting with Nvidia’s new Shield TV, Google Assistant will be supported by an array of Android TVs “in the coming months.” Devices will need to be running Android 6.0 Marshmallow at a minimum to receive Assistant, but aside from the basic requirements, Android TV is all that’s needed. A handful of devices will support the technology, including the Xiaomi Mi Box. At least with the Shield TV, users will be able to experience Assistant much the same way they would with Google Home. That means a complete hands-free experience; users will be able to use the “Ok Google” phrase to activate the feature. It’s unclear how Assistant will work with the other devices, but the gist is Google’s technology is slowly making its way to other platforms. I still want to know why Assistant isn’t available on the Nexus 6P. “Play Stranger Things on Netflix” Porting Assistant over to the TV makes a lot of sense. Alexa and Siri are available in their respective ecosystems, so it was only a matter of time before Google made a similar move. Its purpose might be a little different when living inside of a set-top box as opposed to Google Home, but its capabilities are the same. Below is the list of devices we’ll soon find Assistant on: AirTV Player All Android TV televisions in the United States on Android 6.0 or Android 7.0 (including Sony Bravia and Sharp Aquos lines) Nvidia Shield Xiaomi Mi Box Google said Assistant coming to Android TV is the start of a larger plan to bring the technology to Android Wear 2.0 and in-car infotainment systems, among other platforms. It sounds like 2017 is going to be the technology’s breakout year.

Words such as "forecast," "believe," "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this release involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause the development and monetization of our mobile games, future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the uncertainties inherent in the hits nature of the mobile gaming business. Tapinator undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. The quoting and trading of the company's common stock on the OTC Market Group's OTC Link quotation system is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with the company's operations or business prospects. As a result, there may be volatility in the market price of the shares of the company's common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Market Group's OTC Link quotation system is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on it is often more sporadic than trading of securities listed on the NASDAQ Stock market or another securities exchange. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares. For a further description of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, as well as risks relating to the business of the company in general, see Tapinator's Risk Factors which are available at http://www.tapinator.com/disclaimers.

Image: EPA By Sohini Mitter2017-01-05 15:03:08 UTC Google CEO Sundar Pichai feels that India adopts "remarkably" fast to new products and services. And it is the country's "thirst and hunger" for connectivity that is the driving force.   SEE ALSO: Google plans to get India's 51 million SMBs online with 'Digital Unlocked' "We realize when we build for India, we can actually take it globally," Pichai told a local television station during his ongoing visit.  Google has developed many services in India — YouTube Offline, for instance — and then taken them worldwide.  Pichai says the video service was "made to work offline in India, and is now working well in other places."  He added that Google is working on YouTube Go, a service that would function smoothly on slower internet networks.  An offline version of Google Maps is also being tested in India. Calling India "a quick-test market" in another interview, Pichai said he sees the country's cash transition as an "exciting opportunity".  "We're thinking hard about how to adapt to a cashless India. We might bring services from Google on top of UPI that will make make payments easier," he said.  India, which is currently riding a smartphone boom, is at a "tipping point," said Pichai. And for him, to make Google relevant in this phase will "make it effective elsewhere as well." Pichai's interest in India is not new. During his last visit in early 2016, Google had announced free Wi-Fi services across 400 Indian railway stations.  That ambitious plan is slowly and steadily taking shape as 100-plus busy stations are now equipped with Google Wi-Fi.   And the Indian-born Pichai wants more.  BONUS: Google Earth Timelapse shows how man has altered the planet in 32 years   Topics: Apps and Software, Dev & Design, engineering, Gadgets, Google, Mobile, payments, Product, Sundar Pichai, Tech, YouTube About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 01.05.17. 01.05.17 Time of Publication: 9:00 am. 9:00 am Defeat NIMBYs With pCell’s Wireless Antenna Disguised as a Wire Getty Images Cellular antennas often wear disguises. Chances are, your smartphone has at some point connected to an antenna that looks a lot like a pine tree, a palm tree, or even a cactus. But in typical fashion, serial Silicon Valley inventor Steve Perlman aims to push this idea much further. He and his company, Artemis Networks, just unveiled a cellular antenna disguised as a cable. Yes, it’s wireless technology that looks like a wire. But Perlman, best known for developing Apple’s Quicktime video and Microsoft’s WebTV, didn’t build this new antenna just for the irony. It’s part of his ongoing effort to expand the internet bandwidth available to mobile phones so that everyone can stream more data and more video with fewer hiccups. His new antenna is the latest incarnation of pCell, the Artemis technology that significantly improves bandwidth by providing a kind of personal signal you needn’t share with anyone else. Now, the pCell is only 15 millimeters wide and can fit in the palm of your hand. When slipped into a cable, Perlman says, telcos can not only install it discreetly but without a permit. Artemis Networks Small cellular antennas are nothing new. But typically they aren’t this small, and typically they do require permits. “That’s the bugaboo,” says Joe Hoffman, vice president of strategic technology with tech research firm ABI Research and a specialist in small cells. Recently, T-Mobile lost a battle to overturn a San Francisco ordinance that requires permits for small cells. Sprint has faced similar problems in certain cities. Perlman says that his tiny antennas, called pCell minis, get around these issues. His company is already installing them as cables rather than as antennas, which means they aren’t subject to the same restrictions. “They can be deployed in a way that no one can see them,” he says. This very small cell tech is doubly intriguing because Perlman and Artemis say that they’re testing these antennas through Webpass. That’s the San Francisco-based internet service provider recently acquired by Access, the newly formed Alphabet company that runs Google Fiber. Webpass and Access did not respond to a request for comment, but these tests hint at ways that Access could transform Google Fiber in the years to come. Perlman’s technology could expand the internet bandwidth available not only on phones but in homes. Google Fiber originally operated much like any other ISP: It ran cables into homes and businesses, though these cables provided unusually high-speed connections. But after Google reinvented itself as Alphabet and spun Google Fiber into its own company, execs halted the expansion of the service in order to rework company strategy. Part of this change seemed to involve Webpass, which delivers internet signals to apartment buildings using wireless technology, often a cheaper and more efficient approach than wirelines in dense urban areas. Artemis Networks Today, Webpass uses what’s called point-to-point technology to deliver signals to each building before running cables to individual apartments. Perlman says his technology would allow Access and others to deliver high-speed internet straight into individual homes without any wired connections. Meanwhile, these same tiny antennas could also serve up LTE cellular signals to phones. This too could be of interest to Google, which is exploring its own cellular service, Project Fi. This is not to say that Google will take these routes—or that taking these routes would be easy. Jim Chiddix, the former chief technology officer of Time Warner Cable who has served as an advisor to Artemis and is familiar with the new pCell antennas, says that installing internet infrastructure is never a simple undertaking. “Providing any wide-area network is a lot of work,” he says. Related Stories Google’s Webpass Buy Points the Way to a Speedier Internet for Everyone Legendary Inventor Inks Deal to Test ‘Personal’ Cell Networks This Man Says He Can Speed Cell Data 1,000-Fold. Will Carriers Listen? But the pCell mini could make the process simpler than it is today. For one thing, it’s so unobtrusive. By handling most of the signal processing in software rather than hardware, Perlman and his team have delivered an antenna that can slip into a standard cable without calling attention to itself. What’s more, these devices can sit right beside each other within the cable. Typically, cell antennas can’t be too close because their signals would interfere with each other. “As you put them closer together, you can’t get any additional gain,” Hoffman says. But Perlman’s technology makes use of interference—indeed, thrives on it. In the future, Perlman says, these antennas will also deliver power to phones and other devices over the airwaves—so you (almost) never have to worry about running out of battery juice. “You can imagine a phone designed without a battery,” he says. “We can do that.” Chiddix says that in the short-term, this technology is most likely to find a home inside existing telcos, the companies the already operate the country’s biggest cellular networks. These companies could run the antennas down the street, alongside or in place of existing internet and cable TV wires. That said, the new pCell antennas are already under test inside not only Google but the Dish Network, the TV company that’s licensing wireless spectrum with an eye towards offering internet service, too. With these antennas, the possibilities extend well beyond a good disguise. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Broadband google Google Fiber Wireless Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

In our summary of what to look out for in 2017, we highlighted meaningful motion in web design. It's a concept defined by Google, as part of Material Design. I thought it would be useful to round up some examples of meaningful motion, so below are five examples which I've taken from Google's Material Design guidelines, as well as the Material Design Awards 2015 and 2016. There is a whole bunch of information in Google's guidelines - on duration and easing, movement, transforming material, choreography and creative customization - so do go and check it out. The following simply serves as a taster. And for more on this topic, check out these Econsultancy resources: Mobile UX (User Experience) & Marketing Training User Experience and Interaction Design for Mobile and Web First, what is motion in web design? Google gives us a very poetic definition, as it happens, stating that 'something as simple as tapping a card to expand and reveal more information is made better by fluid animation'. Some other salient points:  '..the user is given guidance with a clear focal point.' '[Motion] conveys energy, drawing inspiration from forces like gravity and friction.' '..material design aims for motion to feel natural..' '..motion should above all else help guide users, providing them with the right information at the right time.' The following video from Google demonstrates some of the principles of Material motion.  Now for the examples... 1. Google Photos The animation when you delete photos feels incredible natural, but Google has not taken the literal approach here, as it points out in its guidelines. If every photo had slid along into the next position, 'overlapping motion paths' would have made the experience too messy. However, Google slides the whole grid to the left, for a smooth and simple transition. 2. Tumblr app Tumblr's app was the recipient of a 2015 Google Design Award for the way in which it uses motion to unite users with content. There are smooth transitions, with 'layers of detail loading progressively' and pacing is determined by context. One design feature is the transformation of a button's icon when selected, with 'create post' icons transforming into a cancel action. The same technique is used in some Google services to transform menu icons into a back button, so users can return to a home screen. 3. 'Pesto' This is actually a demo created by Google, which I've taken from its guidelines. It's a really clear example of how content blocks can simply transition when tapped. 4. Google Duo Google Duo is a video-calling app that launched in August 2016. It was updated in December 2016, to improve video quality and allow easier signup, and could well challenge established video calling services in 2017. The video below shows a number of examples of motion, which Google says 'proved harder than expected' due to the spare nature of the interface, or what it calls 'the lack of connective tissue within the interface'. Durations are longer here, to ensure that transitions are meaningful, that the user knows what action they have performed. 5. Fabulous - Motivate Me This app was awarded a 2016 Google Design Award with the judges praising 'crisp state transitions and pleasing goal completion animations'. There's a video of the app in action on its app store page. I can't embed it here, but you can watch it on YouTube. Note that all these examples are apps, but that doesn't mean these principles aren't relevant to website design. With mobile data input now arguably more important than desktop, marketers should be discussing motion with their tech teams.

Written by Esha Roy | Kharagpur | Updated: January 7, 2017 9:38 am Google CEO Sundar Pichai at his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur where he interacted with students. (Source: Express Photo by Subham Dutta ) The Tagore open air theatre at IIT Kharagpur was packed to its full capacity as 3500 IITians turned up to listen to their alumnus, Google CEO Sundar Pichai. For Pichai, it was an emotional homecoming, his first visit to his alma mater since he graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 1993. “The last time I was here, I was leaving for the railway station to catch my train. It was a sad journey leaving the institute. I have not been back since,’’ said Pichai. Twenty three years later, Pichai, now one of the most noted of IITians, addressed a gathering of students spanning different departments, who had queued up to listen to him since the morning, all wearing black Google baseball caps which they had earlier been given. “When I first came to Kharagpur, I didn’t know any Hindi as I had just arrived from Chennai. But over the weeks I picked up a spattering of the language, confident enough to go to the mess and order food. So I went and called out to the server – ‘Abey Saaley’ – I didn’t know what it meant, but assumed that it was a common greeting because that’s how everyone around me would greet each other. The mess guys were so angry that they shut down the mess for a while,’’ he said amid roars of laughter. Answering questions about his days at the Institute, Pichai said that he would bunk classes like anyone else. “It is a sort of rite of passage in college,’’ he said hurriedly adding, “But I also worked very hard.’’ “The ragging I went through was quite mellow. As freshmen we use to go through something called CG Change, CG standing for Central Gravity. We would lock our rooms and leave for classes and when we got back we would find our rooms completely overturned, with the doors still locked. Our seniors would use rods and sticks and re-arrange everything in the room,’’ he said. Pichai met his wife Anjali, his classmate, at IIT Kharagpur and would walk over to the only girls hostel at the time, SN Hall, to meet her. “I come to India every year. The rate at which things are progressing in the country, at least digitally, is phenomenal. Growing up we didn’t have access to computers. The first computer I ever saw was here, on the IIT campus. And now there are 300 million smart phone users in the country. I just went to Nehru Hall before coming here however, and that looks just the same – I guess something will never change,’’ he said. Also read: Google CEO Sundar Pichai relives college days on IIT-Kharagpur visit Ten years after he left IIT Kharagpur, Pichai joined Google. Ten years after that, he became its CEO. Talking about Google, Pichai said that the latest buzzword in the market, and what Google is currently focusing its Research and Development on is “Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence”. “Google’s R&D focus right now is on machine learning and AI. We have recently published a paper on diabetic retinopathy – which is the fastest growing cause for blindness in the world. We are looking at applying machine learning to all fields such as this eye disease so that one would no longer have to go to a ophthalmologist for diagnosis but a regular doctor will be able to diagnose such diseases as well,’’said Pichai adding, “Google is trying to build products for everyone in the world. For India, we need to get Google working in as many languages as possible and not just English because everyone does not know English.” The Tagore open air theatre at IIT Kharagpur was packed to its full capacity as 3500 IITians turned up to listen to their alumnus, Google CEO Sundar Pichai. “We want to be able to reach out to India’s rural population and do better there. Giving access to people to the internet is important. So we are looking at cheaper smart phones as well – priced at no more than $30. I have heard that Kharagpur station is now connected by WiFi – this is fantastic. All I remember about the station is being made to carry our seniors’ luggage across the platform – and it is a very long platform,” he said. Through his interaction, Pichai was thrown a volley of questions by the IItians – “What was your GPA at IIT?” “Who is your favourite Bollywood actress”, ‘Do you still get calls from your college friends?”, ‘Who was your favourite professor at IIT” , “How do I get a job at Google” and “How much power do you have as the Google CEO? Can you put up the IIT Kharagpur Logo as the Google Logo for a day?” Also read: Google CEO Sundar Pichai relives college days on IIT-Kharagpur visit One student even asked Pichai, “How can I replace you at Google?” To which a laughing Pichai answered, “Be careful what you wish for. But you can always meet me for a cup of chai and we can discuss it.’’ “Every year when I visit Bangalore and Delhi, I meet a number of entrepreneurs running start ups. There is nothing missing in our startups. As a matter of fact they are exceptional and can compete with the best in the world. But the Indian market is not large enough to invest in technology. India has great potential, but a part of the problem is that the digital market is still developing. Otherwise in a country of 1.3 billion, only 300 million have smart phones right now. Hopefully companies will broaden their horizons and their markets and start building products not only looking at the Indian market but also at Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia and other such countries. The emphasis should not only be on national, but international,” he said on Thursday. On competing with China, Pichai said that India’s goal should be a little different. “I am absolutely certain that India can soon become a global player in the world’s digital economy. There are great start ups here. So we shouldn’t just look at competing with China. Very soon we should be able to compete with anyone anywhere,’’ he said. “One of the great things about India is the tremendous interest in education – both among the students as well as their parents. But I come across cases of children in the eighth grade who start preparing for IIT. I am shocked by this. Our education is still very bookish whereas we need a more all-round development and exposure. There is still a lot of pressure to follow set lanes through our colleges and our careers.” “In the US the emphasis is on creativity, and we need to push more for this. IT is very hard to get in to IIT and quite an achievement. But an IIT or any other premier institute is not a guarantee for success. At Google we have many people from IIT. But we also have people from other institutions across the globe and India – and these are remarkable people with remarkable talent as well,” said Pichai when asked about Indian education. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Google Best of Express Meghalaya sex scam: Guest-house owned by Home Minister’s family under probe EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentSalman Khan shares nostalgic picture from sets of Karan Arjun, wishes SRK-Hrithik for Raees-Kaabil EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party Must Read SportsKohli, Kedar hit magical tons to script sensational win SportsThis win is going to take a while to sink in, says Kohli SportsVirat Kohli leaves Twitterati awe-struck after century TechnologyNokia could be developing a foldable smartphone, hints patent TechnologyLenovo sends out press invite for MWC 2017, may debut Moto G5 Plus TechnologyFormer Android chief Andy Rubin to release a high-end, AI-focused smartphone  Sonam Kapoor, Frieda Pinto, Pooja Hegde: Best and worst dressed Bollywood divas at Filmfare Awards 2017 Jan 16: Latest News Centre issues draft requirements under digital village initiative Startup India: 2016 not a good year as new startups decline by 67% China finally agrees to import buffalo meat from India Kathputli Colony: Life at the transit camp C N Rao at Jamia Hamdard Convocation: ‘To excel in science, we need hard work, funds for varsities’ Esha Roy... read more Why Mamata Banerjee’s national battle against demonetisation is all about her troubles in Bengal Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai to IIT-KGP students: Education needs to go beyond books Manipur: ‘I just want a picnic with my friends.

Shopping ES Best Home Gadgets & Tech The best tech for keeping your New Year’s resolutions Start 2017 as you mean to go on —Phoebe Luckhurst gives her guide to the tech that will help you keep your resolutions Phoebe Luckhurst Thursday 5 January 2017 14:20 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard The best tech for keeping your New Year’s resolutions- in pictures 9 show all The best tech for keeping your New Year’s resolutions- in pictures 1/9 Our pick of the best tech will help you to keep your New Year's resolutions 2/9 Lumo Lift £65, Lumo Body Tech, Buy it now 3/9 FitBit Charge 2 £130, Fitbit, Buy it now 4/9 Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet £250, Samsung, Buy it now 5/9 Google Pixel £599, Google Store, Buy it now 6/9 Amazon Echo £150, Amazon,Buy it now 7/9 Apple Portable G-Technology Drive £60, Apple Store, Buy it now 8/9 Belkin Valet Charge Dock £84, Amazon, Buy it now 9/9 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 £1080, John Lewis, Buy it now January’s regeneration is a ritual. Every year you resolve and renounce: no more sugar, a rigorous, focused approach at work, where you will be kind and patient. Some aspirations are short-term and therefore drastic — Dry January, for example, when you invert the hedonism of December by forsaking booze altogether — while others are intended to become permanent good habits. But invariably you drop most of them quietly by mid-February. Read more TV thinner than a smartphone unveiled in Las Vegas Just this once, though, you would like to succeed at your reinvention without becoming a joyless philistine in the process. Partly, of course, the trick is to pick realistic resolutions — drink less, rather than nothing — and partly it is to pick interesting resolutions that inspire rather than extinguish your spirit. But mostly it is about making use of the tools within your reach. Specifically, those on your phone, which is always within your reach and, indeed, is typically clasped in your hand.  This year, technology can help you to be someone else entirely. Vice world Christmas and New Year were heady and hedonistic but your usual method for calming down — resolving to hibernate for a month — usually ends in a blaze of inglorious destruction circa January 12, when it all gets A Bit Much. Technology will save you from your vices.  It can be hard to keep up your resolve once you get to work. No one wants to be made conspicuous by that hefty Fitbit weighing down their wrist and buzzing obtrusively at meetings. At the same time sitting down does lasting damage. Minimise its impact with the discreet Lumo Lift: a magnetic tag that you attach to your clothes and which vibrates when you’re slumping. £65, Lumo Body Tech, Buy it now  If it’s drinking that you’re falling down on, download the optimistically-named Dry January & Beyond (free, iOS and Android). Designed by addiction charity Alcohol Concern, it implores you to keep a — truthful — record of how much you consume and delivers encouraging reports about how much money you are saving. The NHS Smoke Free app does the same for those trying to conquer tobacco (free, iOS and Android). Stay off the booze with the Dry January & Beyond app If you are trying to pick up a good habit, use Google Calendar’s “goal reminders” function. Set an objective and the app will calculate how often you should be reminded about it and how long it will take to achieve each week. It then scans your schedule and inserts reminders to create the time to do what you need to do (free, iOS and Android).  FitBit’s Charge 2 nudges you with a buzz when it thinks you’ve been too restful — it’s a persistent guilt trip that will likely encourage you to meet that 10,000-step target.  £130, Fitbit, Buy it now About time Perhaps yours is a more traditional resolution: namely, to find more time. Try stealing a few minutes by outsourcing your mind to a machine. Wunderlist is a multi-tasking time management app which allows you to create and order to-do lists, tag documents to group them by theme, write notes, set reminders and share work with colleagues. It also has a desktop iteration so you can centralise your plans across devices — if you’re working, switch from smartphone to Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A tablet. £250, Samsung, Buy it now It takes calls and the high-resolution screen will enforce focus even when your concentration is flagging. Better still, Wunderlist was developed by Germans, so the interface is streamlined, intuitive and Teutonically efficient (free, iOS and Android). Or there’s AnyDo: use the calendar to plot your plans and the app’s assistant will issue time- and location-based reminders to make sure you leave promptly. There’s an internal messenger and tasks are laid out in a sensible order unlike on many calendar apps (free, iOS and Android). Organise your life with the Anydo app If you already store most of your life on Google, continue to do so by using Google Keep. It’s a simple app that bids you to add notes, lists, photos and audio clips to a library (free, iOS and Android). Google’s Pixel — the company’s first smartphone — incorporates the intuitive Google Assistant, which manages your task list and nudges you when you need to get a move on. It’s voice-activated: tell it to “remind me to put the laundry on at 7pm” and your task is saved.  £599, Google Store, Buy it now  The Amazon Echo — also voice-activated — answers your questions and can controls lights and thermostats so you’ll spend less time faffing about in the cupboard under the stairs setting the timer.  £150, Amazon, Buy it now    Back up files — and save time you’d spend weeping over lost data — with Apple’s portable G-Technology drive. £60, Apple Store, Buy it now  Charge up — thus saving time stamping your foot in frustration — with the Belkin Valet Charge Dock. £84, Amazon, Buy it now Finally, save precious seconds with a Microsoft Surface Pro 4: you can “write” on the screen to record work with a fluid flourish. You can use the included pen on the other devices in the range — a sleek desktop and slim laptop. £1080, John Lewis, Buy it now Get creative Usually your approach to creativity consists of screenshotting a friend’s Instagram picture, cropping out your arm flab and then distorting it through another filter. Thirteen likes.  But this year will be different: you will create. Firstly, download Prisma. The app, compatible with Instagram, has 30 filters that riff on famous works of art. It imitates the brushstrokes, style and colour of works including The Great Wave, and Munch’s The Scream (free, iOS and Android).  Prisma offers a range of Insta- friendly filters  Animation is the latest frontier: seize the agenda by downloading a video editing app. Shoot 360-degree videos on Splash, which is designed to be used with VR headsets, though you can also share the showreels with friends slow to catch on (free, iOS).  Videorama is a mini-movie maker: cut clips, add animated titles and soundtracks and apply special effects, including explosions (free, iOS).  On Quik, you can make video clips out of photos in your camera roll (free, iOS and Android), and Vue invites you to create montage videos in cinematic style (free, iOS and Android).  Read more TV thinner than a smartphone unveiled in Las Vegas Hyundai creates exoskeleton to offer mobility to the disabled From Amazon Alexa to smartphone instant cameras: how tech got physical Easy money It’s not a glamorous resolution but money begets glamour: if you stop burning a hole in your pocket you’ll have more of it to spend on your own fun (or mortgage). Squirrel asks you to set a budget and then nudges you to stick to it. It syncs with your bank account so you can programme it to release funds automatically on specific dates (£3.99/month, iOS and Android).  Chip is an automatic savings account: its algorithm calculates how much you can afford to save and then diverts the funds accordingly every few days (free, iOS and Android).  Sort out your family finances on the Soldo app If you have a joint account, use Soldo: it’s a group account with a streamlined app that lets you set spending rules, distribute funds, and transfer money instantly between accounts. You can get up to eight Mastercards on one Soldo account (from £2/month, iOS and Android).  This year, trust tech — you’ll barely recognise yourself by February.  Best fitness trackers - in pictures 8 show all Best fitness trackers - in pictures 1/8 The best new fitness trackers for 2017 Misfit 2/8 Fitbit Charge 2 With smartphone syncing that allows you to answer calls and texts, this useful tracker offers 24-7 heart rate monitoring and has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to a week.

By IANS | Posted 05-Jan-2017Now Available on the mid-day iOS App, Download Now Google CEO Sundar Pichai Kharagpur (West Bengal): In a heart-to-heart conversation at his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur on Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about various instances from his personal life from his college days -- from his girlfriend to bunking classes to mess food. He visited his alma mater after 23 years and addressed a townhall packed with students. Some excerpts from his conversation: About his girlfriend Anjali: Anjali is my wife and she was my classmate. She lived in...think you still have S.N. Hall, that was the only girls' hostel then. I hope there are a few more now. It wasn't very easy. If you had to get someone at the girls hostel, you had to walk in the front and request someone there to go call them. And so they would go and loudly say, "Anjali, Sundar is here for you". So it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. Bunking classes: Of course, (I used to bunk morning classes). I think it is the rite of passage when in college. I have to say I worked hard but we did have our share of fun as well. Did Pichai get ragged in college? It was pretty mellow. I definitely remember when I started (hopefully it has got better by now) we had something called a CG chain which stands for "central gravity chain". As a freshman, you lock your room and go out, then you come back and the room doors aren't open but everything inside your room has been rearranged. They do it by putting sticks...and all your clothes and rearrange even the furniture. So its quite a shock when you open your room door and walk back in to see your entire room has been rearranged. About his Hindi vocabulary: I came from the Chennai. I learnt Hindi in school but never spoke it much. Just listening to how people were speaking, I just thought you address people this way. One day there was someone in the mess and I had to call him. I called him "Abey saale!" In my first couple of weeks, I thought you call people that way.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Google More like this Everything is a virtual assistant now Why Google A.I. is the last user interface 9 Alexa tips and tricks Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods Google Assistant will be available soon on Android TVs, with plans to offer the voice-activated personal assistant on car infotainment systems and smartwatches as well. The technology will arrive in the coming months, starting with the Nvidia Shield, on Android TVs in the U.S. running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or Android 7.0 Nougat. Some of the devices expected to ship with Google Assistant are the AirTV Player, Sharp Aquos, Sony Bravia and Xiaomi Mi Box, Sascha Prueter, director of Android TV at Google and Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, wrote in a post on Thursday. “Over time, you'll also see the Assistant come to other new surfaces, like smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0, Android-powered in-car infotainment systems and many other types of devices through the Embedded Google Assistant SDK,” the executives wrote in the post. Google Assistant is already available on Pixel smartphones, Google Home and the Allo smart messaging app. As part of an upcoming update on supported TVs and set-top boxes powered by Android TV, users will now be able to ask the Google Assistant for help to discover and play content, answer questions and even ask it to “dim the lights.” Rival Alexa from Amazon is also making waves at CES in Las Vegas, announcing a number of design wins, including in the automotive and smartphone markets, such as the integration of the cloud-based voice assistant with Huawei's Mate 9 smartphone. Ford Motor, for example, said Wednesday that it would offer Alexa integration with its car infotainment system Sync 3 AppLink. Starting with connecting users to their cars from their homes through Alexa devices such as Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap, the integration would down the line let users take advantage of a broad set of Alexa skills using their voice while driving, the car maker said. Microsoft is also a significant player in this market. A new win for the company could be Volvo Cars, which said recently that it is exploring the use of Cortana, Microsoft’s intelligent personal assistant, in its vehicles. Google partnered with Mercedes Benz last month to allow users to communicate with and control their cars from their homes, using Google Assistant on Google Home.

The chief executive of the world’s second-most valuable company by market cap said this in a student interaction at his alma mater, IIT-Kharagpur, on Thursday. “I am absolutely confident of it. In a 5-10-year time frame, we will see big global software companies coming out of India…we’re growing well as a country and we need to stay on it,” he said. Pichai earned his degree from this institute in metallurgical engineering about and was visiting it after 23 years. “When I talk to startup founders in India, I find them world-class, in terms of how they do things, the entrepreneurial side, how they build products,” he said. Google and digitisation Pichai said Google’s role in digitisation in India is core to their mission statement and the company is making progress through its offerings in various languages. At the same time, Google has been working on the WiFi project with the Indian government wherein it has installed WiFi at 100 railway stations, including Kharagpur. Pichai added that boosting connectivity remains a focus area for the company, which is reflected in its programmes such as the one that trains rural women on how to use the Internet. Pichai’s interaction at his alma mater comes a day after Google India launched a training programme to enable small businesses to come online. Christened DigitalUnlocked, it will offer offline training workshops to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), in partnership with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). Over the next three years, 5,000 workshops will be held across 40 Indian cities. Pichai believes that in India one can actually do very effective public-private partnerships (PPPs). The model doesn’t always exist in all the countries Google has worked with, he said. The firm is also supporting the Digital India Programme and has had several successful partnerships. “We are always looking to partner…if you look at Aadhar, UPI, we’re working on digitising payments, we tend to form these PPPs here and they work very well,” he added. When asked if India will catch up with China on the digital front, Pichai said the goals need to be different. “I am absolutely convinced that India will be a global player in the digital economy and it’ll be competitive with any country in the world,” he said. Bets on machine learning, AI When asked about the next big thing in research and development at Google, he said the company was placing its big bet on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). “Advances in machine learning will make a big difference in many fields. We recently published a paper on using machine learning to help diagnose a disease that causes blindness; but if you can detect it earlier, it can be cured. Using machine learning we can detect it pretty accurately. This is an early example of the kind of changes that will happen when you apply machine learning to all kinds of fields,” he said. Separately, in an interview with The Economic Times on Thursday, Pichai described demonetisation as a bold and courageous move, something, he feels, that could propel the country to the digital forefront. He, however, didn’t seem very appreciative of Indian startups that are seeking protectionist policies against foreign rivals. Google recently launched Primer, a free mobile app designed to teach marketing skills in an interactive way to SMEs. It is available for download on Google Play and the App Store, and would soon be available in Tamil, Telugu and Marathi, apart from Hindi and English. Last year, Google had launched Google My Business, a programme aimed at helping SMBs get an online presence on Google Search and Google Maps without having to invest in a website or domain. The programme has over 8 million Indian SMBs as users. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

He is humble to the level of being shy. Obviously, he is super smart, he was the brain behind the Chrome web browser which is now used by over a billion people and later on he even led the team at Android before being elevated to the position of Google's CEO. In his recent trip to India, he announced the Digital Unlocked programme which is a training programme for SMBs that will help them come online and leverage the power of the Internet. Today, he returned to his alma mater IIT Kharagpur 23 years after being a student there and he addressed an audience full of students who not only gave him a rockstar welcome but listened to him diligently. Here are 20 things that he revealed at the event. • When he first came to IIT Kharagpur, Sundar Pichai thought people called everyone "Abe Saale". He thought it was a way of greeting, He accidentally shut down the Canteen for some time after he greeted one of the staff with the slang. He wasn't liked that much after that, for some time. • He met his wife Anjali at IIT Kharagpur. He used to go to the only girl's hostel nearby to meet her. • On being asked how Google choose projects “We try got work on things which people will use on an everyday basis. We try to build things for billions for people. " • On sudden advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, Pichai said, "The biggest advances are due to 2-3 reasons. The techniques are largely the same, earlier there wasn't enough computational power. Now that is possible combined with better data, the improvements are drastic. " • On the future of the Indian market: The potential is there and the market is developing. In a couple of years, the potential will be realised. It is difficult to scale across India. • On building specific Products for India: At Google when we build products for India, they often work globally as well. • On his role as CEO: As a leader, it is about making your team successful. I value teamwork. It is important that people want to work together. It is about fostering an environment of collaboration. • On creating an IIT Kharagpur Google Doodle: If I send an email, they wouldn't do it. We are very thoughtful about these things. We have set up rules to go by. • On the ideal smartphone price for the Indian Market: We need to bring down the price to $30 for an entry level smartphone for India. • On ragging: "I was asked to carry luggage for incoming seniors at IIT Kharagpur station. It has a long platform." • On Demonetization: We are working on digitising payments. India will be a global digital economy and a competitor with any other country in the world. • On getting into Google: There are several successful people at Google who are not from IIT. There are many paths to success for sure. Getting into an elite institution doesn't guarantee success. • On What keeps him going: The thing that keeps me going is the desire to build products which are used by billions of users • When I was interviewed at Google on April Fools Day, They had just announced Gmail which was invite only. People asked me what was Gmail but because it was April Fools, I didn't know what to say. First, three interviews I didn't know what to say, but at the fourth interview I was shown Gmail and I told them what I thought about Gmail and how to improve it. • On the day of my interview at Google, Larry had just stopped interviewing people as now the company had more than 1000 employees. I was one of the first people who wasn't interviewed by Larry so I often joke that I got into Google because Larry didn't interview me. • His views on Cricket: I love watching cricket and soccer. Loved watching Tendulkar, he started playing when I was at IIT. Gavaskar was my favourite. Currently, Virat Kohli is the favourite. I didn't think it was possible for someone to have an average of 50 in all three formats T20, ODI and Tests. • On His GPA at IIT: Too embarrassed to admit after the first year it wasn’t great, but it was so good in the next three that I made up for it. • At Google, I had the chance to host Deepika Padukone. I used to enjoy watching Prakash Padukone (Deepika's father) play Badminton. • On his Favourite Professor’s:"Professor Roy and Professor Indranil Manna who is now at IIT Kanpur were my favourite professors." • On being asked whether he was in touch with old friends "I do still get calls from my college friends. A few of us met up at Bangalore. I do have a group, follow up on Facebook and WhatsApp." FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit Tags: Sundar PichaiGoogleGmailSmartphonesIIT KharagpurIIT Follow Gizmodo on facebookLiketwitterFollowgplusFollow Contribute to Gizmodo Write for Us Next StoryHTC to launch its new One X10 Phablet in Q1 Comments () Characters Remaining: 3000 SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION X Sort By:NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown Voted More from this author Finally Google’s Android Wear 2.0 will be released next month Sushma Swaraj threatens to cancel visas as Amazon caught selling Indian flag doormat Lenovo P2 with 5,100mAh battery launched in India for Rs 16,999 on Flipkart Related stories What Google CEO Sundar Pichai Will Do During His India Visit It’s Confirmed!

Complaining about tracking too much private information? The Department of Labor is taking legal action against advertising giant Google in an attempt to get its hands on compensation and remuneration information. Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), provides cloud computing services to various federal agencies and has been asked to hand over the information as part of a routine audit into the equal opportunity hiring practices. Google, whose search engine meticulously tracks information on just about everyone and everything on the internet, has apparently refused to provide the government the names and salary details of its employees. The Labor Department has now requested that a judge cancels all of the technology titan’s federal contracts unless it provides the required information. "We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation,” said Thomas Dowd, acting director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Google’s stance is that it has already required hundreds of thousands of records, but it is not prepared to provide even more confidential information on its employees.

By Oliver Cragg January 5, 2017 13:25 GMT Close CES 2017: The best tech on show IBTimes UK Nvidia has unveiled the next generation of its Android-powered home streaming box at CES 2017. As well as a refreshed design, the updated Shield TV will offer 4K and High Dynamic Range (HDR) streaming, support for Google Assistant, and integration with the SmartThings smart home ecosystem. The new media player begins shipping on 16 January, retailing at £189.99 in the UK. The Californian tech company noted that the new and improved Shield TV will support 4K quality video streams across Netflix, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu, as well as support for Amazon Video's 4K HDR content. Thankfully, Nvidia appears to be fully aware of the processing demand of higher quality content, claiming that the new box offers three times the performance of any other streaming box currently on the market. While the full specification details have yet to be revealed, Nvidia did confirm that both a remote control and game controller will be bundled with each box. For those with deeper pockets, a Pro edition will also come to market later on (price to be confirmed) with 500GB internal storage and a remote with a headphone port. Alongside plug-and-play PC gaming support – with Ubisoft's Watch Dogs 2 and For Honor mentioned at the announcement event – and a Steam app coming to the Shield's Play Store for PC-to-TV game streaming, the major additions to the next Shield TV device are its smart home and voice recognition features. Elsewhere at CES, Google confirmed that its personal assistant AI which debuted on the Google Pixel smartphone range is spreading to Android TV media boxes, including the Shield TV. Google Assistant enables voice control for media searches, playback control, as well as its usual services such as internet searches, travel updates and more. Nvidia unveiled its new Shield TV streaming box at CES 2017Nvidia The assistant AI also links into the Shield TV's SmartThings support, which causes the Shield to act like a standard SmartThings Hub and controlling connected smart home appliances, lighting, and other compatible Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To help further integrate its assistant AI with smart home functionality, Nvidia also announced the Nvidia Spot, which is essentially an Assistant microphone that can be placed around the home for quick commands in a similar fashion to Amazon's Echo Dot. The Shield Spot will retail at $49.99 in the US (UK pricing to follow). "ShieldTV is the world's most advanced streamer. Its brilliant 4K HDR quality, hallmark Nvidia gaming performance and broad access to media content will bring families hours of joy. And with Shield's new AI home capability, we can control and interact with content through the magic of artificial intelligence from anywhere in the house," said Nvidia founder and CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, at the company's CES 2017 keynote.

Mr. Pichai, who was speaking at IIT-Kharagpur, said the focus was also on areas such as local language support and improving connectivity in India. “I would love to see cheaper smartphones, entry-level smartphones. I think really we need to bring the prices down even more, maybe at USD 30 level,” he told an audience of 3,500 students and teachers. Google was able to roll out many programmes for 'Digital India' through “effective public-private partnerships," he said, citing examples such as partnership with RailTel for offering Wi-Fi services at railway stations and with the NPCI for digital payments. 'India will be a global player in digital economy' Mr. Pichai said he was confident that India would be a global player in digital economy. “I think I am absolutely, with full certainty, convinced that India will be a global player in digital economy and it will be competitive with any country in the world in the digital economy. We have all the foundation." Connectivity was “extraordinarily important.” Google was working on a number of projects such as 'Internet Saathi' to educate people on Internet, especially in rural areas, as well as to get them online. Google was working on making its services available in as many local Indian languages as possible. “English is spoken only by a small segment of the overall population. So just getting Google to work in other languages is a big focus. We have made progress today in Android, with search, we support many languages but we want to do all that better so that it works even in rural situations with the right dialects and so on,” he said. Bets big on AI, machine learning Technologies lsuch as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can make huge difference to everyday life and Google was investing in bringing these to “as many people and as fast as possible”, he said. “We are making a big bet on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Advancements in machine learning will make a big difference in many many fields,” Mr. Pichai said in an interaction with students at IIT Kharagpur. He pointed out that the ability of computers to do tasks such as image recognition, voice recognition or speech recognition, are reaching a tipping point. “So, we are definitely at a point of inflection,” he said, adding that Google iwas investing a lot in this space and if the investments were sustained over a few years, it would pave the way for the next wave of computing. Pointing out to a paper published by Google recently, Mr. Pichai said machine learning could be used to detect diabetic retina, which can cause blindness if treatment isn’t administered on time. “This is an early example of the kind of changes that will happen when you apply machine learning to all kinds of fields. Google alone won’t do this. What I am excited about is bringing machine learning and AI to as many people and as fast as possible,” he said.

What constitutes a mobile interstitial that would trigger the penalty is something Google has been answering for months now. Recently, Kristine Schachinger asked Google's John Mueller if it is only from search results page to the landing page and yes, it is. Google is only looking to see if a mobile interstitial is being triggered after the searcher goes from Google to your page. What they do after the page, Google is not currently looking at. So if you don't have a mobile interstitial on the SERP to the page but you do from a page to another page - you are fine. @schachin @methode yes— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) January 4, 2017 Forum discussion at Twitter.

Wednesday. / AFP-Yonhap By Yoon Sung-won LAS VEGAS ― LG Electronics is strengthening cooperation with Amazon and Google in introducing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for smarter home appliances and robots, the company said Wednesday (local time). During a press conference at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, LG Electronics CTO Scott Ahn promised that LG will provide customers with innovative technologies infused with AI, including big data, cloud computing and the internet of things (IoT). "We will expand cooperation with global partners such as Amazon and Google and join the international IoT standardization alliance, the Open Connectivity Foundation, to strengthen ties for standard technologies," he said. LG Electronics introduced its exclusive operating system (OS) for home appliances, WebOS, for the first time in a refrigerator. Prior to this, the OS has been mainly used in the company's smart TVs. The new smart refrigerator has a 29-inch full high-definition touch LCD on the front. A double-tap on the screen activates lighting inside the refrigerator, allowing users to look inside without opening the door. A Smart Tag feature allows them to register food storage information such as expiration dates on the screen. The company said the new smart refrigerator, the LG Smart InstaView Door-in-Door, is compatible with Amazon's voice-recognizing AI system Alexa. A user can give a verbal order to the Alexa system to play music, search for news information, shop online or check schedules while cooking, according to the company. "It is a pleasure to present a unique system based on the technologies of the two companies, which are respectively leading the home appliances and IT sectors," Amazon Senior Vice President David Limp said. "Under the solid partnership, we will seek the future of smart homes together." LG Electronics also unveiled its new line of self-learning home appliances, Deep ThinQ. Based on a technology called "deep learning," its new devices, such as air-conditioners and robot vacuum cleaners, are designed to collect the information from multiple sensors, analyze data through Wi-Fi networks and the cloud to access the use patterns and environmental factors, the company said. The company also said it will boost its robot business, integrating and tapping into all technologies including deep learning, autonomous driving, control and IoT that it has accumulated through experience in the robot vacuum cleaner business since 2003. At Wednesday's conference, the company unveiled Hub and lawnmower robots for households and public-use robots that help passengers at airports. The Hub robot is designed to control other smart devices at home, read books for people, play music, send reminders of scheduling information and give tips for cooking recipes. The airport robots, Airbots, include one for passenger guidance and another for facility cleaning. LG Electronics said both models will start pilot operations at Incheon International Airport this year. For cars, LG Electronics introduced a voice and motion recognition interface, panoramic display, a surround view monitoring system and a drive state monitoring system that prevents users from driving while drowsy. The company also unveiled the LG SIGNATURE organic light-emitting diode (OLED) W televisions, which are less than 4 millimeters thick. Tim Baxter, president and COO of Samsung Electronics America, speaks during a Samsung news conference before CES International, in Las Vegas, Wednesday. / AP-Yonhap Samsung's IoT startup fund Samsung Electronics will establish a $150 million fund to foster promising startups in future technologies, aiming at boosting the IoT connectivity chain of its products and services. By investing in IoT, virtual reality (VR) and AI startups through its Samsung Next Fund, the company expects to vitalize the IoT-related industrial ecosystem. "Samsung Electronics has strived to provide consumers with entertainment and convenience through technological innovations and lifestyle designs," Samsung Electronics America President and COO Tim Baxter said. "In 2017, our major home appliances, including TVs, will be compatible with the IoT and based on this, more services will be available." At a press conference the day before the opening of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017, Samsung Electronics said it will present a new washer and dryer set, called the Flex Wash and Flex Dry. "On the back of the innovative Add Wash, Samsung Electronics has been recognized as a top brand for washers, following refrigerators, in the U.S. market," said John Herrington, senior vice president and general manager of home appliances at Samsung Electronics America. Both devices are divided into a smaller top and larger bottom that can work separately. They are also equipped with smart home features based on the IoT. Users can monitor and control all washing and drying processes through a mobile device. The premium kitchen appliances package, which includes a refrigerator, wall oven, combination oven, top cooker, hood and dishwasher, also supports IoT connectivity through Wi-Fi, the company said. Samsung Electronics also announced new partnerships for its wearables, including the Gear S3 smartwatch. Working with global industrial designer Arik Levy, it released a new smartwatch band for the Gear S3. It has also cooperated with U.S. music streaming service Spotify, German carmaker BMW and global sportswear brand Under Amour for new smartwatch apps. The company showcased two new Chromebooks and premium gaming laptops, called the Samsung Notebook Odyssey series. The new gaming laptops have wider cooling vents and fans to maintain performance even when running games for a long time, it said. Following a showcase, Samsung Electronics highlighted its new 88-inch and 75-inch QLED TVs at the event. "The new QLED TV is the next-generation product that has overcome the limits of existing displays," said Joe Stinziano, executive vice president of Samsung Electronics America. During Tuesday's showcase, the company stressed that the new QLED TVs provide more vivid brightness and depict deeper blacks with wider viewing angles. Stinziano also highlighted that the new QLED TV can connect to peripheral devices using a single transparent cable and can be mounted on a wall without making multiple large holes in it. He said the company will start shipping the new TVs next month. yoonsw@ktimes.com Hyundai Motor vice chairman showcases self-driving technology at CES Coway showcases 'smart' home appliances at CES 2017 LG Display disregards Samsung's TV comparison Samsung CE chief stresses potential in IoT business 1.

(Getty Images - File Photo) Shares6 DNA Web Team | Thu, 5 Jan 2017-06:33pm , Mumbai , DNA webdesk Sundar Pichai has made another trip to India. The CEO of Google Sundar Pichai has made another visit to India. This time around, he spent some of his time in India to addressed students at IIT-Kharagpur, was interviewed by publications, spoke at a news conference in New Delhi and more. He even took a trip down memory lane as he recalled his first interview at Google. Here are 5 things Sundar Pichai said: 1) "I interviewed in Google in April 1, 2004, which is April Fool's Day, and Google had just announced Gmail, and it was invite only, but people still weren't sure if it was an April Fool's joke." "And I remember doing my interviews through the day, and people kept asking me, 'What do you think of Gmail?', but I hadn't had a chance to use it. I thought it was an April Fool's joke," "It was only in the fourth interview when someone asked me, 'Have you seen Gmail?' and I said no then he showed it to me, and then the fifth interview I was finally able to start answering." "So for the final four interviews I was able to finally tell them what I think of Gmail and how to improve Gmail, and that's my interview experience," 2) "Last year was a big one for us. We focused sharply on machine learning and artificial intelligence and how we can use it to make our services better. We think of this as an important inflection point. We brought out products like Google Assistant and Google Home. Pixel (Google's smartphone) also has the assistant built in. I view that as a foundation for how we will think about things for the next many years," said Sundar Pichai in an interview with TOI. 3) "We want to always work on ambitious things and by definition, we won't succeed in everything.

News Business Business News Google faces US government contract ban unless it reveals how much employees get paid Labour Department says the demand is designed to ensure company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race Michael Liedtke Thursday 5 January 2017 12:35 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The US Labour Department is trying to bar Google from doing business with the federal government unless the internet company turns over confidential information about thousands of its employees. The potential banishment is being sought in a Labour Department lawsuit filed Wednesday with the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The complaint alleges that Google has repeatedly refused to provide the Labour Department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure the company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race. Read more Google cut £2.9bn off its 2015 tax bill using 'Dutch Sandwich' trick The review of how Google pays the thousands of workers at its Mountain View, California, headquarters is allowed under decades-old laws regulating US government contractors. Google has struck a series of deals with various federal government agencies during the past decade, including a digital advertising agreement cited by the Labour Department that has generated more than $600,000 for the company since June 2014, according to the complaint. That amount is a pittance for Google, whose revenue has surpassed $130bn during the same span. If Google doesn't comply with all its demands, the Labour Department wants a legal order that would void all of the company's current federal government contracts and block future deals. Read more Google publishes eight secret FBI requests Google results claim that the Holocaust didn't happen Google employees confess what they hated most about working at Google In a statement, Google said it has provided hundreds of thousands of records in an attempt to comply with the Labour Department's requests, but has rebuffed some of the agency's demands as "overbroad" and an invasion of employee privacy. Like most other big technology companies, Google for the past few years has been posting breakdowns of its workforce that show most of its computer programmers and other high-paid employees in technical jobs are white and Asian men. The disclosures have become a source of embarrassment for Google and its technology industry peers, who have repeatedly acknowledged they need to do more to hire women, blacks and Hispanics. "We're very committed to our affirmative action obligations, and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues," Google reiterated in its response to the Labour Department's lawsuit.

In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty But Google, which is part of Alphabet Inc., and other tech companies so far have only been disclosing the types of jobs held by the two genders and different races without providing specifics about the salaries in different employment categories.

The Labour Department maintains that Google agreed to submit to a higher level of scrutiny when it decided to do business with federal agencies funded by taxpayers. "Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation," said Thomas Dowd, acting director of the Labour Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.

Addressing the students at IIT-Kharagpur, Pichai said that as India aims to become a global player in the 'digital economy', the focus should be on areas like connectivity and local language support. "I would love to see cheaper smartphones, entry-level smartphones. I think to really we need to bring the prices down even more, maybe at USD 30 level (about Rs 2,000) for India for entry level smartphones," he said addressing an audience of 3,500 students and teachers. In 2014, Google had launched its 'Android One' programme, partnering with handset makers, to launch high-quality, yet affordable Android devices for consumers in emerging markets like India. A few handsets were launched with partners like Micromax, Karbonn and Spice. The devices launched that time were priced at Rs 6,399 onwards, but since then many more affordable smartphones with better specifications have hit the market. Currently, there are smartphones available even for sub-Rs 1,000 but most of the aspirational devices are priced above Rs 3,000. Pichai said the company has also been able to roll out many programmes for Digital India through "effective public-private partnerships". He cited examples like partnership with RailTel for offering wi-fi services at railway stations and with NPCI for digitising payments. When asked about by when India would be able to catch up with China on the digital front, Pichai said he is confident that India will be a global player in the digital economy. "I think I am absolutely, with full certainty, convinced that India will be a global player in the digital economy and it will be competitive with any country in the world in the digital economy. We have all the foundation," he said. He added that the startups in India, that is building products for India and the world, will ensure that happens. Stating that connectivity is "extraordinarily important", Pichai said Google is also working on a number of projects like Internet Saathi to educate people on Internet, especially in rural areas, as well as to get them online. Besides, Google is also working on making its services available in as many local Indian languages as possible. "English is spoken only by a small segment of the overall population. So just getting Google to work in other languages is a big focus". "We have made progress today in Android, with search, we support many languages but we want to do all that better so that it works even in rural situations with the right dialects and so on," he said.   With PTI Inputs First Published: Thursday, January 5, 2017 - 18:23 More from zeenews   India France backs India, opposes China; wants Pakistan's Masood Azhar to be declared as international terrorist Swaraj India launches 'Jawab Do Hisab Do' campaign in Delhi in the wake of MCD elections Western disturbance leads to rise in minimum temperature in J&K, Rajasthan, Delhi More from India World Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu slams `futile` Paris peace conference Bahrain executes 3 prisoners for first time in decade Muslim girl 'booted from school bus' for hijab in United States More from World Sports I-League: Super-sub Karan Sawhney's late strike does it for Mumbai FC Gold for Haryana girl Neeraj as Indian pugilists shine at Nations Cup EPL: Pep Guardiola rocked as Everton crush Manchester City, Zlatan Ibrahimovic rescues United in Liverpool draw More from Sports Entertainment Shahid Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Saif Ali Khan talk about their 'Rangoon' experiences Shah Rukh Khan's 'Raees' director Rahul Dholakia helped Mahira Khan – Here's how Latest Box Office collections of 'Dangal' and 'Ok Jaanu' are out!

After announcing the Digital Unlocked initiative for Indian small and medium businesses (SMB), Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday visited his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur. Pichai, who is currently in India on a work and personal visit talked about his time at IIT-KGP and Google in addition to taking live questions. At IIT-Kharagpur, Pichai answered questions from students at an open-air theatre in the campus. The Chennai born CEO discussed his life on campus in an event titled 'A journey back to the past to inspire the future'. The event, which was attended by over 3,500 students, was streamed live by Google on YouTube. Talking about how things have changed in terms of technology, Pichai said, "The rate at which things have been progressing in India is phenomenal." "We didn't have phones back then. I remember waiting for a long time to get a rotary phone at home. Didn't have access to computers growing up. Clearly the progress has been phenomenal," added the Google CEO. "I am fully confident that India will be a global player when it comes to digital economies. We are growing well as a country and will not be behind any country, even the most advanced ones when it comes to digitisation and digital economies," he said. Pichai was interviewed by Google on April Fool's day in 2004. Stating that it was just then that the company had introduced it email service Gmail, he thought it was an April Fool's joke and it wasn't until halfway through the process that he realised it was a real thing. Recalling a funny incident back in the college days Pichai said, "I didn't know Hindi too well when I came here from Chennai. I thought "abbey saale!" was a way to call out to people. I learnt Hindi in college." On being asked about how he met his better half, Pichai said, "I met Anjali at IIT-K and she was my classmate. Just to go get someone at the girl's hostel, you had to walk in the front and request someone to call them. And they'd go in and loudly say Anjali, Sundar is here. It wasn't exactly a pleasant experience," he said. Talking about how Google is working on products for the country that can be expanded globally, he said, "We look forward to cheaper smart phones in India. In the $30 bracket for entry level smartphones. We at Google want to focus on usage of Internet in rural areas in India. We are big supporters of the Digital India program.

LAS VEGAS—I suspect we're going to be hearing a lot more about phone brand Coolpad pretty soon. While it's been in the US market since 2012, the former smartphone maker was recently snapped up by deep-pocketed LeEco, which means it's going to have lots of dollars behind it and lots of desire to become bigger on our shores. The Coolpad Conjr, available for pre-order January 5 on Amazon, is the company's first foray into unlocked phones in the US. From a hardware perspective, it's a pretty good deal for $179.99. It'll compete in that market with Huawei's Honor phones, Moto's G lineup, Blu's phones and other low-cost unlocked devices. The Conjr is your typical rounded gray slab, with a 5-inch 720p screen that has nicely saturated colors and a round fingerprint scanner on the back. It has a 13MP main camera and an 8MP front-facing camera, 16GB of storage, 3GB of RAM, and a MicroSD card slot. It's running on a relatively low-rent Mediatek 6735 processor, and it's LTE banded for both AT&T and T-Mobile. So far, so good. I've been playing with one here at CES, and it's a cute entry-level phone, which is happily non-huge and has good basic specs. The main camera looks great outdoors but struggles in low light. The selfie camera is unusually good for a phone this cheap. But oh, man, the software. The Conjr runs a very heavily skinned version of Android 6.0.1, and it's kind of a mess. There is just far too much going on. Much of it is well-meaning; Coolpad has added a lot of useful (and some peculiar) features, which I'll get to in a minute. But the skin makes the phone feel laggy, a lot of fit and finish is lacking, and many of the changes are just unnecessary. All the icons are different from Google's. Even the Play Store! Why did you have to change the Play Store icon, Coolpad? Dig into the Cool Manager utility app, and you find really useful features like call blocking, app-by-app data limitation, and easy app privacy settings. Another useful feature lets you log into two Facebook or WhatsApp accounts at the same time. But the text in the Cool Manager app is oddly spaced and the language seems stilted. Pull down the windowshade to see the nonstandard notifications pane, and sometimes it snaps back annoyingly against your will. The Photos and Music apps are different from the standard Google ones but no better, just different to be different. There's no app drawer, and pulling up from the bottom of the screen summons a too-iPhone-like quick settings panel. I'm still trying to figure out the feature in the selfie camera, which claims I'm "Mr. McDreamy" and 34 years old. I mean, I like it, but I can't understand why it's there or how to turn it off. Coolpad needs to stop. If you wonder why Coolpad is doing this, it's because it's Chinese. In China, where Google basically doesn't exist, Android phone makers have to develop entire software stacks to replace Google mobile services. Every phone maker has its own UI, and Chinese consumers love cutesy icons and complex shortcut systems, a Huawei exec once explained to me. But here in the US, design tastes are different, and we like Google's UI. LeEco's Way In Here's the really important thing about Coolpad: LeEco. LeEco is a giant Chinese conglomerate that's been snapping up and spawning companies left and right. Called by some the "Netflix of China," it bought TV maker Vizio, it made the movie The Great Wall starring Matt Damon, and it really wants to be a big player in phones. But its Le Pro 3 phone is shackled by a commitment to carrier-free sales and an awful software skin tied to LeEco's lousy content lineup in the US. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2017! Coolpad, on the other hand, has had a relationship with T-Mobile since 2012. The Catalyst, its latest budget phone, has been a successful seller, Coolpad spokeswoman Xin Hamilton said. As ZTE explained to me yesterday, about 88 percent of phones in the US are still sold through carriers. In June, LeEco bought a controlling interest in Coolpad. LeEco told me that the two companies are being operated separately, at least for now. But you see where this might be going. If LeEco and Coolpad work together, LeEco's very deep pockets could combine with Coolpad's carrier relationship to give it a bigger place in this market. It'll have to steal market share from someone. That someone might be Alcatel OneTouch, especially if Alcatel's parent TCL finds upscale BlackBerry branded phones to be more profitable in the U.S. Coolpad has cool hardware at a good price. Now it just needs to remember how great Google's Android UI is, and it could really take off.
