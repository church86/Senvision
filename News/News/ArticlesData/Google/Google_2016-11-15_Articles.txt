Search Watch Live Home UK World Business Politics Technology Entertainment Strange News Weather Google plans to punish websites publishing fake news The search engine is going to restrict ads on sites which post false stories in a bid to tackle the scourge of misinformation. 08:43, UK, Tuesday 15 November 2016 Image Caption: Google plans to restrict ads to fake news websites imminently Twitter Share on Twitter Facebook Share on Facebook Google+ Share on Google+ Whats App Share on Whatsapp Mail Share by email Google has said it is working on a new policy to restrict lucrative adverts from being placed on fake news websites. Technology companies have been under increased scrutiny in the wake of the US election, amid allegations some Silicon Valley giants have failed to protect their users from inaccurate content. A Google spokeswoman said: "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content or the primary purpose of the web property." Only on Monday, a fake story which claimed Donald Trump received 700,000 votes more than Hillary Clinton was given a prominent slot in Google rankings for the phrase "final election results". Video: Faked on Facebook: Can you tell what's true? The article was from the pro-Trump "70 News" website, and still appears high up in Google's search results even though the tech company has acknowledged the error.  Although Mr Trump won the presidency after receiving the most Electoral College votes, the Republican is actually trailing Mrs Clinton in the popular vote. Google's new policy, which could be enforced imminently, may give sites a bigger incentive to offer accurate information to readers - or face losing a hefty chunk of their revenue. Facebook is another tech company that has faced allegations of potentially swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network - amid research that suggests about 60% of Americans get at least some, or all, of their news from social media. Image Caption: Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the influence of bogus stories on Facebook On Saturday, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said "more than 99% of what people see" on Facebook is authentic. He wrote in a post: "Identifying the 'truth' is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted." Google said it was working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense network while Facebook updated its advertising policies to state that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to fake news.

Earlier today those searches turned up some interesting results are Google surfaced fake election results at the top of the page, even putting those results front and center in Google Assistant. Now the company is making some changes to help prevent fake news from spreading. According to Reuters, Google is moving to restrict fake news website from using Google’s AdSense ads. It’s unclear when this new policy will take effect, or how Google plans to enforce it, but this couldn’t come at a better time. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property. How would this affect the sharing of fake news? Many websites that spread fake news content are powered by Google’s AdSense ads, relying on them to drive revenue. As posts on those websites go viral, as we’ve seen many times on Facebook especially, those sites gain money from users who visit the site. Google’s current rules for websites using AdSense block content such as violent content, pornography, or hate speech, but inaccurate news is not listed. That’s what Google aims to change. By cutting those sites off at the wallet, much of the incentive for writing fake news may be taken away, thus limiting the amount of fake news circulating on the web. Of course, enforcing all of this is going to be another story entirely. As Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media states, Google may have a tough time keeping up what qualifies as a fake news site. He said “it requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale.” We can only hope others will follow Google’s example in stopping the spread of fake news around the web as Facebook also did tonight.

Photo: AP mail print View all comments Tweet By Nick Wingfield - - Published: 12:45 PM, November 15, 2016 Updated: 5:11 PM, November 15, 2016 WASHINGTON — During the past week, two of the world’s biggest Internet companies have faced mounting criticism over how fake news on their sites may have influenced the presidential election’s outcome. On Monday (Nov 14), those companies responded by making it clear that they would not tolerate such misinformation by taking pointed aim at fake news sites’ revenue sources. Google kicked off the action on Monday afternoon when the Silicon Valley search giant said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service. Hours later, Facebook, the social network, updated the language in its ad policy, which already said it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites. “We have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. “Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.” Taken together, the decisions were a clear signal that the tech behemoths could no longer ignore the growing outcry over their power in distributing information to the American electorate. Facebook has been at the epicentre of that debate, accused by some commentators of swinging some voters in favour of President-elect Donald Trump through misleading and outright wrong stories that spread quickly via the social network. One such false story claimed that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr Trump. Google did not escape the glare, with critics saying the company gave too much prominence to false news stories. On Sunday, the site Mediaite reported that the top result on a Google search for “final election vote count 2016” was a link to a story on a website called 70News that wrongly stated that Mr Trump, who won the Electoral College, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Mrs Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote. By Monday evening, the fake story had fallen to number two in a search for those terms. Google says software algorithms that use hundreds of factors determine the ranking of news stories. “The goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,” Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville, said in a statement. “In this case, we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.” Facebook’s decision to clarify its ad policy language is notable because the social network’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, has repeatedly fobbed off criticism that the company had an effect on how people voted. In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, he said that 99 per cent of what people see on the site is authentic, and only a tiny amount is fake news and hoaxes. “Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,” Mr Zuckerberg wrote. Yet within Facebook, employees and executives have been increasingly questioning their responsibilities and role in influencing the electorate, The New York Times reported over the weekend. Facebook’s ad policy update will not stem the flow of fake news stories that spread through the news feeds that people see when they visit the social network. Facebook has long spoken of how it helped influence and stoke democratic movements in places like the Middle East, and it tells its advertisers that it can help sway its users with ads. Facebook reaches 1.8 billion people around the globe, and the company is one of the largest distributors of news online. A Pew Research Centre study said that nearly half of American adults rely on Facebook as a new source. Google’s decision on Monday relates to the Google AdSense system that independent web publishers use to display advertising on their sites, generating revenue when ads are seen or clicked on. The advertisers pay Google, and Google pays a portion of those proceeds to the publishers. More than 2 million publishers use Google’s advertising network. For some time, Google has had policies in place prohibiting misleading advertisements from its system, including promotions for counterfeit goods and weight-loss scams. Google’s new policy, which it said would go into effect “imminently”, will extend its ban on misrepresentative content to the websites its advertisements run on. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content or the primary purpose of the web property,” Ms Faville said. Ms Faville said the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to the election. It remains to be seen how effective Google’s new policy on fake news will be in practise. The policy will rely on a combination of automated and human reviews to help determine what is fake. Although satire sites like The Onion are not the target of the policy, it is not clear whether some of them, which often run fake news stories written for humourous effect, will be inadvertently affected by Google’s change.

By Agamoni Ghosh November 15, 2016 05:38 GMT Google is working to change its policy to ban fake news websites from using its ad networkReuters Following fake news stories flooding the internet during the recent US presidential elections, Google has decided to restrict such websites from using its advertising software. The company said it was working on a fool-proof policy to prevent these websites from garnering any revenue through its network by spreading false information. AdSense, Google's advertising network, allows advertisers to place text ads on millions of websites that are part of Google's network. The company says it has always prohibited the platform from being used by sites that promote hate speech or include pornography or violent content but its policies previously did not include restrictions on sites that spread false content. Although the move aims to curb revenue these sites generate from Google's ad network, it still does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. Google's decision comes days after criticism poured in over Google search, Twitter and Facebook being used as promotional platforms for spreading false and malicious information which some experts believe may have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has already come out twice defending his platform in this regard and assured that alleged fake news circulated on Facebook did not influence the outcome of the election. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic," he clarified in a post."Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes."

SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc's Google said on Monday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of "fake news" and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google's move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. Google's ready with its big bet in India's premium smartphone market Analysts expect Google to start with about 1 lakh devices to make a dent in India's premium smartphone segment, which is dominated by Samsung and Apple. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. Macedonia news AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic," he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. Facebook apologizes to advertisers, here's why Facebook on Friday apologised for an error in the way it measured a key metric of video viewership that significantly amplified users' viewing times on its platform. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. "One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money," he said. "This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites." However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. "What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale," he said.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Google to prohibit fake news sites from using its ad software 2016-11-15 07:24 Post a comment 0 share: RELATED ARTICLES Media fights back as invasion of fake news intensifies ‘Sockpuppet’ Twitter accounts used in #HandsOffGuptas information war Did Facebook and Twitter inadvertently help Trump win? Hollywood Reporter - Google is cracking down on fake-news sites. The search giant plans to prohibit websites that publish news from using its ad software, a product called Adsense that allows publishers to place Google ads on their websites. Google's move, which will cut off a key revenue stream for these sites, comes as fake news has proliferated online, especially on Facebook, throughout the election. Google, too, has dealt with the rise of fake news. Several outlets have reported that on Sunday an inaccurate news story claiming that Donald Trump would win both the popular vote and the electoral college was the top result for some election-related searches. READ NEXT: Media fights back as invasion of fake news intensifies On Monday, Google responded swiftly. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the move, says the changes are imminent and are in line with Google's existing policies. A Google spokesperson sent the following statement to The Hollywood Reporter: "We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property." Facebook in particular saw the proliferation of fake news during the election, prompting some critics to question the role the social network played in helping Trump become elected. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that notion "a pretty crazy idea." He then took to Facebook on Saturday to clarify his position, writing that "more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." BuzzFeed reported on Monday that some employees at the social network would like to see Facebook clamp down on fake-news posts. Quoting unnamed sources, the online outlet reported that a group of employees have formed a renegade task force whose goal is to offer recommendations to Facebook's senior management about how to handle fake news.

By: AP | San Francisco | Updated: November 15, 2016 4:16 pm Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. Google’s search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week’s election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet’s gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. WATCH VIDEO: US Presidential Elections: Fun Facts Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. WATCH VIDEO: US Presidential Elections 2016: Here Is The Full Process SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy ” in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t always an easy task. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google’s search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat’s findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. “What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,” Doctor said. “These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.” It’s difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. Read: Google highlighting inaccurate story about US presidential election results But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research’s survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.

The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google's move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. MACEDONIA NEWS AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic," he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. "One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money," he said. "This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites." However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. "What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale," he said.

I thought to myself, why not collate this data and share it?” Mainkar says. | TNN | Updated: Nov 15, 2016, 01.10 PM IST (Representative image) PANAJI: Necessity is the mother of invention and the current cash crunch faced by the common man due to the demonetization move prompted Ponjekar Prajyot Mainkar reason enough to find a solution. The result: a simple technological way out to ensure that thousands of people save time and effort while hunting for money. Mainkar setup a crowdsourced Google sheet (tinyurl.com/atmgoa) to identify ATMs in Goa that are functioning and those that are out of cash. Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining information or inputs on a particular project by enlisting the services of a number of people through the Internet. "Everyone is running from ATMs to banks looking for money, but the information whether the ATM is working or out of cash is not shared. I thought to myself, why not collate this data and share it?" Mainkar says. Mainkar is the founder director of Androcid Media Pvt Ltd, a startup that develops Android applications and Content Management Systems (CMS). He has served as a consultant for mobile labs startups and is a regular at the Google I/O conference. A simple Google doc page lists various ATMs around Goa and helps users decide whether it is worth the effort to travel a distance away to get funds. "I got the idea on Sunday at 1:30pm and by 2pm the site was ready. I started with Panaji, but slowly people began to add places like Mapusa, Porvorim, Ponda, Shiroda, Siolim and other locations," Mainkar says. He appears incredulous at the response he has received as the general perception is that Goans are not mobile savvy and that Internet connectivity is poor. Given the response, Mainkar is already planning several improvements in the system. "I have already had over 500 visits, with 87.9% of the users accessing the site from mobile phones of which 95% are from Android smartphones," Mainkar says. There is another reason why Mainkar is keen to ensure that the crowdsourced document gains traction. "IFFI is around the corner and Goa is expecting people from around the world. They will face a severe problem with cash and we need to cater to them," he says. Chennai and Pune have already learnt from the Ponjekar and have created similar crowd sourced sites to assist locals. "It takes a lot of time to do it alone and it cannot be done alone," Mainkar explains. He has reached out to several banks and local people to spread the message, but was surprised when banks refused to cooperate. "Currently, the Google sheet is getting updated every hour. We are looking at reducing that to less than an hour," Mainkar says. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of midafternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. • FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS. False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. • SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS. Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy ” in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t easy. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Tags : iOS-iOS+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ The topic of fake news and the websites that propagate false stories has gotten a lot of attention in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election. Google has taken heat for having incorrect news stories pop up in its search results, while Facebook has been criticized for the amount of fake news shared on its platform throughout the campaign. Neither company is taking on fake news sites directly, but both are taking aim at disrupting the financial incentive these sites have by banning fake news websites from using the ad-selling networks from Google and Facebook. Google made the announcement first and said it would ban the sale of ads "on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose," which would include fake news websites. Facebook made its announcement later and tried to make it sound as though it had this policy all along and the company was simply updating the policy "to explicitly clarify that [it] applies to fake news." The implicit aim from both companies is that by barring fake news sites from selling ads, the sites would lose financial benefits from operation. It seems to us as though Google and Facebook want to try to kill off fake news sites without taking an active hand in editorial decisions. Unfortunately, neither company has mentioned yet how they plan to identify fake news sites or enforce these policies.  source: WSJ 1 & 2 Share Tweet Share Rumor: Apple explores the production of smart glasses to wirelessly link 14 Nov Prev news Android gets an official Instagram account 14 Nov Next news Close newer posts At long last: WhatsApp's video calling feature now rolling out to all users 15 Nov Pregnant woman falls asleep on her Apple iPhone 7 and ends up with second 15 Nov Just days before unveiling, the Vivo X9 appears on Geekbench 15 Nov Android gets an official Instagram account 14 Nov Now reading: Google and Facebook ban fake news sites on their ad networks Google and Facebook ban fake news sites on their ad networks 14 Nov Rumor: Apple explores the production of smart glasses to wirelessly link 14 Nov Rejoice selfie fans, LuMee 2 is here 14 Nov You can now get the Google Pixel home button animation on the Nexus 6P 14 Nov Samsung's Black Friday 2016 deals revealed (but don't get too excited) 14 Nov Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes iPhone 7 demand has peaked, predicts yearly 14 Nov older posts Featured stories   Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 edge a.k.a.

TerryTerius (Posts: 1923; Member since: 10 Apr 2014) The difference being with a fake news site there is no expectation of "bias" and no claims of authorship. You as a reader aren't primed to reject what is being said automatically. In other words, if you present yourself as a unaffiliated party then in theory what you report would be taken more seriously. There are lots of people who believe information just because it doesn't come from the usual places. Same reason then a lot of people believe in conspiracy theories. posted on 4 hours ago 0 Reply 7.

Home News Reviews iPhone Apps Android Apps Windows Apps Top Mobiles Latest Mobiles Upcoming Mobiles PhoneRadar Explains Search PHONE FINDER COMPARE PHONES Phone News Apple explores the idea of Wearable Glass for iPhone like the Google Glass Google Glass was one of the most ambitious projects from Google back in the day. It surely did have some nifty little features that would make you go WOW on them! However, in reality, not many were interested in buying them and wearing them as a regular wearable. This started changing thereon, and the Google Glass project which was one of the most talked about device soon became dead. It is still a great concept to behold, but the not people were happy with the fact that a Glass is constantly seeing what you are doing. With that being said, it looks like Apple is going to work on something similar. We don’t have any confirmation on this. However, it does look like Apple is trying to enter the race which was once lead by Google. According to the new reports which we have here, it appears that the Cupertino Giant has purchased some of the components for testing purposes. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier. Do make a note here that, they haven’t purchased enough which indicates a mass-production yet. Hence our best guess is that they have done so for the sake of testing. Well, it is not a bad thing by any means. If the company is trying to test out something, then there is a huge potential for a possible success here, and maybe someday we will see a product from them. On the other hand, it is nothing new in the world of technology that every another day, some or the idea is explored. But that doesn’t mean that we will see a final product. In either case, don’t expect anything from the company anytime soon now. If at all the company decides to make these, we probably will not be seeing them until 2018 or even more. With that being said, let’s not speculate on this anymore since it is too early in the day to do that. If in case you remember, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, stated that AR would take a while since there are lots of challenges on the way. However, once it happens, it will happen in a big way, and everyone will wonder how they lived without it all these years just the way you might think about smartphones now. Not the strongest of words here, but still it might give you a hint that Apple is indeed trying out their luck with the AR, etc. Who knows, maybe one day we will see a Google Glass type of product from them which will have some AR capabilities as well. Well, as mentioned earlier, it is still too early to speculate around this and hence let’s leave it here and continue speculating around something which is more likely to happen soon like the iPhone 8. We have already covered a bunch of rumors about the iPhone 8 like a bezel-less display. Stay tuned for more info on this and other news from Apple and more. Note – The featured image displayed above is of Google Glass.

The article falsely states that Clinton lost both the electoral college and popular votes, and its placement in search indicates how Google handles fake news.  ( David Paul Morris | Getty Images ) Advertisement Shortly after the rise of accusations targeted at Facebook for helping, by some measure, influence the outcome of the 2016 Presidential Election due to its lackluster efforts in eliminating fake news on people's newsfeeds, another company has been found to have also mishandled fake news. This time, it's Google. Several websites have reported seeing a fake news article featured as one of Google's top stories upon entering relevant search terms such as "Presidential election results" or something similar along the lines. Dan Abrams of Mediaite first spotted the incident. Google normally tallies up relevant news stories that correspond to the search terms users enter. In this case, an article from a blog called "70 News" was placed at the top or grouped within legitimate stories. The article in the aforementioned blog declares President-elect Donald Trump as having successfully won both the electoral college and the popular votes. For the record, Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, despite losing the electoral college votes, won the popular vote, with unaccounted mail-in and absentee ballots slated to further balloon her tally in a couple of weeks' time. The trail of evidence that lead to the article's assumption begins with a USA Supreme article having denoted that Clinton might win votes tallied but won't win votes cast because of "ignored Republican absentee ballots." A Twitter user named Michael used the USA Supreme article to inaccurately report the number of popular votes. The author of 70 News then used Michael's numbers to create the article that's now showing up atop Google's search results. The Rising Problem Of Fake News Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has rebuked a growing belief that the careless proliferation of fake news on the site helped propel Trump to win the presidency, with the foremost issue trailing toward the abysmal practices of Facebook in keeping its site disinfected from fake news, or similar inaccurate reports that often inhibit an agenda with questionable and even conceptually violent intents, such as, but not limited to, spurring hate crimes. Now that there's a new President-elect, a surfeit of analyses is littering the web, either knee-jerk or rational appropriation pieces on why the elections turned out the way it did. All the polls previously heralded Clinton as the surefire winner by a staggering percentage that eclipsed Trump's chances of victory. As publications spurn or scrutinize the turnout, pressure has been put on social media sites with flawed algorithms causing the lack of a proper weeding-out of fabricated and false coverage. Google Bans Fake News Sites Google is planning to elbow fake news sites away from its advertisement software, the company told the Wall Street Journal on Monday. Google banning these sites from taking advantage of its ad-selling software is an indication that it's addressing the recent criticism received by social media sites on its mishandling of inaccurate information. Google has promised to gate-keep ads from appearing on websites that distribute fake news. "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users," a spokesperson from Google told The Verge, stating that it's currently fine-tuning its algorithm.

Alphabet, Google's parent company has announced plans to prohibit fake news sites from using the company's ad-selling software, AdSense, which is how many of those sites make revenue. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is updating its policies to prohibit its ads from being displayed "on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose," as well as those that distribute fake news. While preventing those sites from using AdSense will not necessarily curb the sharing of misinformation, the move will hurt those site's ability to make money, possibly forcing them to close. The spread of fake news has become a huge post-election topic, with Facebook, in particular, coming under fire for spreading fake information during the months leading up to the presidential election. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has previously said that the idea the fake news influenced the election is "crazy." However, BuzzFeed reports that a group of Facebook employees have reportedly created a secret internal task force to investigate and perhaps offer a solution to the issue.

Investor demand for Prosper's loans had evaporated and losses were mounting.  But that sacrificial gesture wasn't enough. Vermut resigned as CEO last week, the company said Monday, and will be replaced by CFO David Kimball.  The news is yet another sign that online lending companies remain in turbulent waters following the scandal that engulfed market leader Lending Club in May.  AOC prosper Seize the day!

The battle cry seems to have resonated, as Bloomberg reports that news organizations are seeing a marked increase in contributions and subscriptions.  At the New York Times, reports Bloomberg, "subscriptions have risen at four times their normal rate since election day." More, traffic has been ballooning. The Wall Street Journal, too, has been seeing an influx in subscriptions. Meanwhile, the nonprofit ProPublica was flooded with donations Monday.  Since winning the election last week, Donald Trump has continued his attacks on the media, in particular the Times, which he criticized on Twitter.  Will the spiked interest in well-reported news continue or will the fad inevitably die down as people return to their Facebook-oriented lives? As a journalist, I certainly hope it continues, but who knows!

The developer of the software, Shanghai Adups Technology, says the program runs on more than 700 million devices, from phones, cars, and other hardware. As of now the most affected are international consumers and owners of disposable and prepaid phones, but one Miami-based phone manufacturer, BLU Products, says at least 120,000 of its phones contained the bug, which it has fixed via software update. Adups apparently designed the backdoor to help an undisclosed Chinese phone manufacturer monitor user behavior, but the program ended up on American phones anyway. The Times points out that Adups lists two China-based largest phone makers, ZTE and Huawei, as distribution partners–both of which have been trying to make inroads in the U.S., and would likely see those efforts scrutinized if either is linked to the backdoor revelation. JJM 11.15.16 | 10:35 am Average monthly earnings for gig economy workers are in decline  Sharing economy platforms like TaskRabbit and Uber are struggling to retain their workers—and now, we have a better idea as to why. Average monthly earnings for labor platform contractors have fallen 6% since June 2014, according to a new analysis by the JPMorgan Chase Institute.  The declining wages are due in part to increased competition, which has led to lower prices. (No wonder over half of Uber drivers quit within a year.) However, the change in wages differs dramatically from city to city.

To that end, the telecom giant yesterday acquired LQD WiFi, a New York-based startup that makes kiosk systems for "smart" cities.  Kiosks providing Wi-Fi and neighborhood information have become popular with city planners, who see the systems as a way to provide internet access and engage with residents. Verizon's other investments in urban IoT infrastructure include devices and services for lighting, security, and traffic management.  AOC verizon 11.15.16 | 9:00 am Morning intel: Tinder adds non-binary gender options, Twitter expands “mute” and hateful conduct reporting  • Google, Facebook, Facebook, Amazon, and other Silicon Valley companies have written a letter to President-elect Trump asking that he support encryption and immigration reform.  • Twitter just rolled out an update to its mute feature and improved on its reporting tools for hateful conduct, as part of the company's continued efforts to make Twitter a safer space.  • In a similar vein, Tinder tweaked its app to better address the needs of transgender users. The "gender" field in the app will now include non-binary gender identification terms, as well as a write-in option; users can also opt to keep their gender private.  • Both Google and Facebook have taken steps to combat fake news following the election, by barring fake news sites from using AdSense and The Facebook Audience Network, their respective advertising businesses.  • Apple is reportedly looking into creating digital glasses with augmented reality tech, according to Bloomberg.  PM 11.15.16 | 7:54 am Google, Facebook, and others ask Trump to support encryption and immigration reform The Internet Association, which has more than 40 members including Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon, has penned a letter urging President-elect Trump to implement stronger reforms on government surveillance programs, support net neutrality, and "expand and improve the green card program" for immigrants, reports the Verge. Trump was particularly harsh on tech companies on the campaign trail, notably calling out Apple for not helping the government unlock iPhones in specific law enforcement cases. The letter ends stating, "The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue" with the president-elect. That's a more congenial tone than what most of the tech leaders had for Trump before the election, when 100 of them signed a letter saying a Trump presidency would be a "disaster for innovation."

The animal parts are being sold in private Facebook groups that require approval from a group admin before a member can join. In all, $53.1-million worth of ivory and other animal parts have been sold in the last 18 months.  MG Facebook 11.15.16 | 1:30 am WhatsApp adds a feature: video calling Facebook owns two messaging services. One, Facebook Messenger, does a ton of stuff. The other, WhatsApp, is famous for sticking to the basics—which, rather than hurting it, has helped it rack up more than a billion active users. But now WhatsApp is adding something: the ability to make video calls. The feature is especially logical given that the app is widely used by folks to stay in touch with distant friends and family in other countries. (The app introduced voice calls last year.) Video calling is rolling out "in the coming weeks" and will be available in WhatsApp's versions for iOS, Android, and Windows.   HM Whatsapp 11.14.16 | 11:27 pm Following Google, Facebook also moves to ban fake news sites from using its ad network In the face of widespread criticism that the proliferation of fake news posts on Facebook played a role in misleading voters and impacting the presidential election, on Monday evening the company banned fake news from using its ad network. The Facebook Audience Network is used by third-party sites and apps to display ads to users, with Facebook getting a portion of the ad revenue. With today's move, Facebook is adding such fake news sites to its blacklist of misleading and illegal sites that aren't allowed to use the ad network. The step follows Google, which earlier today banned fake news sites from using its AdSense ad-selling software. "Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance," a company spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal.  MB Facebook Advertise Privacy Policy Terms About Us Fast Company & Inc © Mansueto Ventures, LLC
Back To Top[*] Google moves to restrict ads on fake news sites Nov. 15, 2016 - 01:45PM JST Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Monday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of “fake news” and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google’s move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for ‘final election count’ for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google’s network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google’s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google’s move with AdSense was a positive step. “One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,” he said. “This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.” However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. “What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale,” he said.  Back To Top[*] Switch to full browser version © 2016 GPlusMedia

Snowden says tech companies should protect privacy no matter who is president Posted Nov 10, 2016 by Devin Coldewey, Contributor 0 SHARES Next Story Slice makes it easy for you to order from your favorite pizzeria Advertisement Edward Snowden gave an extended interview today touching on numerous topics, from the Trump Presidency to his own future. Overall his message was clear: it’s not about thwarting one leader or even one government, but using technology that guarantees rights across borders and administrations. In other words: don’t hate, innovate. One of the early questions in the interview, which lasted a bit under an hour and was sponsored by Startpage.com, was posed by Phil Zimmerman, creator of the PGP encryption protocol. Trump, he said, would be inheriting a powerful surveillance infrastructure — something that worries many. “We should be cautious about putting too much faith or fear in elected officials,” Snowden said. “We’re never farther than an election away from a change in leader, from a change in policy, a change in the way the powers we have constructed into a system are used. So what we need to think about now is not how do we defend against a president Donald Trump, but how do we protect the rights of everyone, everywhere, without regard to jurisdictions, without regard to borders?” “Ultimately,” he said, “if we want to see a change, we must force it through ourselves.” Of course, until we do, there are good and bad ways of going about the business of communicating online. Snowden suggested that we need to look for companies “that see you as their primary customer.” In other words, not Facebook or Google. “Everything you type into that Google prompt is being saved forever,” he pointed out (to the evident glee of his interviewer, who represents a Google alternative). Whereas in the case of encrypted messaging app Signal, which fought and triumphed over a government gag order to reveal orders to turn over information on a user. Because Signal is end-to-end encrypted, all it could turn over — even had it wanted to give more — was a phone number (which the government already had), an account creation date, and a last login time. “The best way to defend against it,” Snowden said, in reference to the surveillance apparatus, “is to make sure you do not collect information, as a business, that you do not need.” Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes His voice joins a chorus of others calling for companies to rein in data collection ahead of Trump’s inauguration, after which many expect an expansion of powers in law enforcement and surveillance. Snowden had very little practical advice other than using encryption and two-factor authentication. He did endorse Signal more than once, however, as he has done before. As for himself, he downplayed the idea that Trump and Putin would change the existing stalemate regarding his asylum. “I don’t worry about it,” Snowden said. “It would be crazy to dismiss the idea of this guy who presents himself as a big deal-maker, trying to make a deal. But the President of Russia has said on camera that the people of Russia consider me a human rights defender, and regardless of the position that we have on Russian politics — which obviously have a lot of problems — they said that Russia is not a country that extradites human rights defenders.” He also discussed where work needs to be done in the future. Related Articles Snowden docs link NSA to Equation Group hackers Why did ProtonMail vanish from Google search results for months? Encrypted comms company Silent Circle closes $50M Series C “Encryption protects what you said on a phone call as it crosses the internet, it protects what was written in a text message, it protects your picture so no one can see it,” he said. “But it does not disguise the fact that you sent a photograph or made a phone call. These things on their own can be very dangerous. Metadata of your activities can often be collected even without the involvement of a court. This means you can create perfect records of private lives without ever reading what was actually said.” His suggestion: “We have to find a way to protect not only the content of communication, but to disguise the fact that the communication ever happened at all. The fact that this phone called this phone should be invisible to the vast majority.” Tor is a start, he said, but crude, like the first wheel. The very nature of how information is broadcast over radio frequency may need to be questioned, he mused.

Waxing philosophical, he continued, saying that privacy has little value for the majority, the people in positions of power who don’t need to watch what they say. “Minorities, vulnerable populations, people who don’t fit in — if you disagree with the majority opinion, you are the ones privacy is for. If you argue that if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear, that’s no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say. It’s an antisocial argument.” To protect this right, Snowden returned to the concept of privacy being enforced not through legislation, but technology. “When the law fails, when we find out that the law is not enough, that the law is only the smallest guarantee of our rights, support technology, corporations, groups, and individuals who are trying to enforce your rights directly,” he said, “through science, through math, through technology, to ensure that any government anywhere must respect your rights — because no amount of violence, no amount of military force will ever solve a math problem.” Although Snowden largely avoided addressing the risks of a Trump Presidency during his talk, the mask did crack slightly as he led up to an inspiring finish to one of the later questions. “”Despite the challenges we have in the United States, despite the changes in government, despite some of the very concerning statements made by our new President-elect, this is a nation that will strive to get better,” he said. “This is a dark moment in our nation’s history – but it is not the end of history. and if we work together, we can build something better.” Featured Image: Bryce Durbin 0 SHARES Featured Stories Microsoft teams up with Elon Musk’s OpenAI project 3 hours ago | Frederic Lardinois Google and Facebook ban fake news sites from their advertising networks 5 hours ago | Romain Dillet WhatsApp launches video calling for everyone 11 hours ago | Josh Constine, Sarah Perez Valuation metrics show weakening for the fourth straight quarter 17 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From TechCrunch Nike’s self-lacing shoes are coming soon, priced at $720 16 minutes ago | Brian Heater The cameras are coming 17 minutes ago | John Mannes Ava, the fertility wearable, raises $9.7M to help families conceive 22 minutes ago | Sam O'Keefe Apple’s big App Store purge is now underway 38 minutes ago | Sarah Perez Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Advertisement Comment moderation powered by Up Next Slice makes it easy for you to order from your favorite pizzeria Posted Nov 10, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Technical Content Writer @ Pantheon at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Staff Software Engineer @ Lending Home at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco: Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Monday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of “fake news” and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the US presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google’s move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for ‘final election count’ for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. Macedonia news AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google’s network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google’s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google’s move with AdSense was a positive step. “One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,” he said. “This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.” However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. “What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale,” he said.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Google is working on a policy update that will prohibit fake news websites from using its ad-selling software. The move would ultimately make it more challenging for those fake news sites to earn revenue. Reuters reports: The policy change is imminent, Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," she said in a statement. The policy change comes amid an intensifying debate over how much responsibility technology companies bear for monitoring the accuracy of content as more and more people access news through sites such as Facebook rather than traditional media companies. Facebook, in particular, has been criticized over the spread of inaccurate articles promoting U.S. president-elect Donald Trump on the site. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has denied that the site influenced the outcome of the election. Google's AdSense advertising network is a key financial driver for many publishers. The company places various restrictions on where its ads may be placed, including bans on pornographic and violent content. Work on the policy update began before the election, Faville said. ads facebook google ← Related Links → Apple Considering Expansion Into Wearable Glasses, Says Report Facebook's Fight Against Fake News Was Undercut by Fear of Conservative Backlash Chemical Traces On Your Phone Reveal Your Lifestyle, Scientists Say Google To Prohibit Fake News Websites From Using Its Ad-Selling Software More | Reply Login Google To Prohibit Fake News Websites From Using Its Ad-Selling Software Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the US presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google’s move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for ‘final election count’ for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. Macedonia news AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google’s network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news — much of it denigrating Clinton — which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google’s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google’s move with AdSense was a positive step. “One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,” he said. “This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.” However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. “What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialised knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary Tinder launches transgender-inclusive update, allowing users to select personalised gender identity (VIDEO) Internet Association seeks peace with wish list for Trump WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Is the world ready for Apple glasses?

Read More The LG V20 is one of the few flagship devices with a removable battery and microSD expansion card slot. Thankfully, it does not have the failed modular design of the LG G5. It's a worthy successor to the LG V10 and may appeal to the road warrior. The LG V20 is the first non-Pixel Android smartphone to launch with Android 7.0 Nougat so you won't have to wait ages to be updated to the latest version of the operating system. Specifications LG sent along the T-Mobile LG V20 for me to evaluate so I could use it daily with my own personal SIM card, which is the best way to truly test out a mobile phone. Processor: 2.15 GHz Snapdragon 820 Display: 5.7 inch Quad HD IPS at 2560 x 1440 pixels resolution, 513 ppi. Secondary display: 160 x 1040 pixels, 3.1 inches Operating system: Android 7.0 Nougat RAM: 4GB Storage: 64GB internal storage and microSD card slot Cameras: Dual rear cameras; 16 megapixel 75-degree f/1.8 and 8 megapixel 135 degrees f/2.4. Front-facing 120-degree 5 megapixel f/1.9 with toggle for 83 degrees. Audio: Loud, bottom-facing mono speaker with 3.5mm headset jack Extras: IR port for remote control, FM radio Battery: 3,200 mAh removable battery with Quick Charge 3.0 technology Dimensions: 159.7 x 78.1 x 7.6 mm and 174 grams Last year, it was rare to find water resistance and millions of us were able to survive without it for years. However, after I killed the pre-production model while it was in my pocket during a walk in light rain, I am hesitant to buy a phone without some form of water resistance or nano coating. Hardware The LG V20 is a big phone, 1.5 mm taller and 0.2 mm wider than the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. It is 14 grams lighter so if you are OK carrying the iPhone 7 Plus, or 6s Plus for that matter, then you will likely be just fine with the LG V20 too. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Like the iPhone 7 Plus, the LG V20 is a glass and metal beast. With a removable metal back, you might think it feels cheap and that the fit and finish would suffer. That is not the case here as LG has done a great job with a solid back release button, positioned as if it was a camera capture button, and a metal back that extends up the sides and nearly the entire back of the phone. The metal is thin and light, but when it is locked into place on the back of the LG V20 it feels great. Seams are tight, the glass/metal/plastic meetups on the corners of the sides look good, and overall the LG V20 is a smart looking device. It will definitely look good in the office and conference room. In addition to good looks, the LG V20 is built with AL6013 aluminum and silicone polycarbonate to withstand the MIL-STD 810G transit drop test. We saw this integrated durability with the LG V10 so it's great to know your phone could survive an accidental drop. The LG V10 had sturdy stainless steel rails and a rugged rubberized back. The LG V20 uses thin aluminum material and it doesn't feel as substantial as the V10. The front Gorilla Glass 4 extends all the way to each side and just a few mm from the top and bottom. There is a plastic and glass bottom bezel with LG stamped into the glass portion. It's a smaller chin than the Google Pixel and Moto Z with the plastic and glass offering a nice place to rest your thumb. Above the main display you will find the secondary display with the front facing camera to the left and headset speaker above. Volume buttons are found on the upper left with the back cover release button towards the lower right. The speaker, a mic opening, 3.5mm headset jack, and USB Type-C port are all positioned on the bottom. Another mic is placed on the top, along with a very small opening for the IR port. There is a definite camera hump on the back, centered above the rear fingerprint scanner. I'm personally not a fan of rear fingerprint scanners as it requires that I pick up the device to unlock it while it rests on my desk. The camera protrusion contains the dual LED flash, two rear cameras, and the laser sensor. Just looking at the back tells you that the LG V20 is a media capture focused device. LG V20 review: in pictures SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 13 NEXT PREV One rear camera has a 135-degree lens with a single button toggle in the camera software. You can capture more content in your photos through the front 120-degree lens too. Again, there is a toggle for the front facing camera to have a standard image or wide-angle image from the front. T-Mobile continues to improve and expand its LTE network and one unique feature of the LG V20 is support for T-Mobile's new LTE AWS-3 spectrum. This support should give users more capacity for data, depending on whether or not the area you are in supports AWS-3. It's nice to buy a phone with support for the latest and greatest network technology, especially when it also launches with the newest version of the Android operating system. The LG V20 is a media creation machine with three excellent cameras and three mics. The V20 captures audio using 24-bit/48 kHz Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM), the same format used in professional video equipment. A quad-DAC (digital to audio converter) from ESS Technologies is included in the LG V20. T-Mobile and Sprint include the B&O Play H3 headphones so you can enjoy a fantastic audio experience with your favorite music. Android Authority has a very detailed article that explains all you ever wanted to know about this technology. The bottom line is that high resolution audio files should be more enjoyable, but even with my standard quality audio files I am enjoying the music experience on the LG V20. Software Typically when you purchase a new Samsung, LG, or HTC device you are buying one with the previous version of the Android OS. Thankfully, LG worked with Google to launch the LG V20 with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Google will keep some Nougat features exclusive to the Pixel line, but it's still good to know that you are purchasing a phone with the latest version of Android. The LG V20 I am using has the 1 September 2016 Android security update too. As the mobile space continues to evolve, most manufacturers have learned to reduce the influence of their custom UI. Samsung TouchWiz is unrecognizable from the past heavy-handed cartoon animations, however LG still has a UI that is a bit too strong in my opinion. You can customize the heck out of the device though and you can always install a third party launcher if that works better for you. I installed the Google Now launcher as I prefer to swipe over for the Google Now screen and am satisfied with the LG V20 running in this manner. LG calls its latest UI LG UX 5.0+. By default, there is no app drawer present, but a simple toggle enables the more traditional app drawer for those who prefer this interface. LG UX 5.0+ includes Knock Code, 2nd screen notifications and controls, advanced audio recording modes, themes, LG Health improvements, multi-window support, and more. These type of manufacturer customizations may slow things down a bit, but so far I haven't seen lag on the LG V20. LG attempts to implement a comfort screen feature, but it is only enabled manually. iOS and some other Android devices let you setup a time when the display switches to a mode to help with late night or early morning usage and I would like to see LG implement this functionality too. Pricing and competition The T-Mobile LG V20 will be available this week for $769.99, which is actually about $100 less than competing flagship devices. In addition, when you purchase this phone from T-Mobile you receive a free pair of B&O Play H3 earphones, a $149.99 value. LG phones have always launched a bit less than other flagships and the LG V20 is no different. A comparable 128GB Apple iPhone 7 Plus is priced at $849. The 128GB Google Pixel XL is $869. The 6-month old Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, with 64GB internal and microSD card, is priced at $789.99. LG V20 first impressions: in pictures SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 12 NEXT PREV The price of the LG V20 looks to be all over the place with AT&T charging $829.99, Verizon $672, and Sprint $792. Sprint also includes a free pair of Bang & Olufson H3 earphones. Daily usage experiences and conclusion LG doesn't get much respect in the mobile space, but then again it launched the LG G5 with no useful modular accessories so hasn't necessarily convinced people it deserves their business. The LG V20 was announced in early September and may have won some new customers if it could have been available a few weeks ago when the Galaxy Note 7 went down in flames. That said, the LG V20 will be launching this week and it is a fantastic option for Android smartphone fans. As I stated in my first impressions, the more I use the LG V20 the more I like it. Now that I have it loaded up with all of my favorite apps and have been using it as my daily driver it is definitely a device to consider. If you create content, both in images or audio, then I don't think you will find a device better than the LG 20. Audio quality is outstanding and the ability to control and edit the audio right on the phone is amazing. It's truly a portable media creation machine. Call quality is outstanding on the T-Mobile network with VoLTE and video calling support. The inclusion of AWS-3 is important for the enterprise customer looking for a phone that is able to work with future network expansion. Some folks won't buy a phone without a removable battery and with this feature, you will be able to use the LG V20 for years. When the battery degrades over time, simple replace it and get back in action again. It would be great to at least see some nano coating in the device, but without that if you intend to use the LG V20 outside in the elements you should look for a water resistant case.

The Wall Street Journal reports that fake news has been added to the list of content that disqualifies a website from tapping into the Facebook Audience Network, which allows sites and mobile apps to post display advertisements to visitors, with Facebook sharing some of the generated ad revenue. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesperson told the Journal, adding that fake news would now come under the umbrella category of misleading, illegal and deceptive sites, which already cannot use the ad network. The change in policy closely follows a similar move by Google, also announced Monday, which would see websites publishing fake news barred from its advertising network. Read More: Facebook Changes Rules Around Controversial Race-Based Ads A Google spokesperson said in a statement that “pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property” will join the list of websites banned from using Google AdSense, reported Reuters. The report noted that AdSense already restricts ad placement on sites containing pornographic or violent content. The role of tech giants like Google and Facebook in the spread of untruths and hoaxes online is in the spotlight. While Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t think that the spread of untruths on his network affected the outcome, and doesn’t want Facebook to be the “arbiters of truth,” others have pointed out the platform’s sheer, unprecedented influence as a media entity. There are no indications that Facebook’s latest move would affect the types of content allowed on its own platform’s News Feed. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google’s move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for ‘final election count’ for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google’s network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news – much of it denigrating Clinton – which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google’s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google’s move with AdSense was a positive step. “One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,” he said. “This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.” However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. “What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale,” he said.

CST November 14, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. Alphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election.  (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College.) "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said in a email statement. The results popped up under a Google search banner called  "In the News" when a user searched for "who won the popular vote." As of Monday evening, the blog's post was still there, though it followed stories that referenced the erroneous results. In the News is different from Google News (news.google.com.) The dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. Most news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN, according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. The erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. Facebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is "authentic," and has vowed to weed out fake news. A group of Facebook employees have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report. Facebook was not immediately available for comment.

New Report Claims Cupertino Giant Working On Smart Glasses With AR By Corazon Victorino On 11/14/16 AT 10:33 PM Close Over the weekend, a limited number of Snapchat’s Spectacles sunglasses went on sale. The high-tech glasses that work with both Android and iOS devices records 10-second video clips that can be uploaded into Snapchat story. Since the $130 device is making waves and getting attention from the techie community, could Apple be also planning to release its own version of the Spectacles? On Monday, unnamed sources told Bloomberg that Apple is planning to expand into digital glasses for its next endeavor in the wearable market. The Cupertino giant’s glasses project is said to be in the exploration phase for now, but the company could already have the fixed goal of producing glasses that would show images and other real-time data in the wearer’s field of vision. The glasses are also expected to connect wirelessly to Apple’s iPhones and work using augmented reality.  Given that the product is not going to focus on recording short video clips, the device couldn’t technically be considered as Apple’s direct competitor to Snapchat’s Spectacles. Instead, this could be Apple’s attempt at capturing the market that showed interest in Google’s dormant Google Glass wearables. Should this project progress, the tech community could expect Apple’s digital glasses to arrive possibly in 2018.  Related Stories Snapchat Spectacles Release Date: Buy Them From Snapbot Mobile Vending Machines Facebook Flash Unveiled For Developing Countries: Report New Snapchat Update For iOS Adds Support For Spectacle Glasses But When Will They Release? Per the leaksters who shared the information about Apple’s next wearable, a clear sign that Apple is serious about the project is how CEO Tim Cook has been acquiring projects and teams of developers to beef up the company’s AR technologies. Also, Cook, himself, has been quite vocal about his interest in AR, as per AppleInsider.  The Google Glass was introduced as an advanced head-mounted display that utilized augmented reality to display weather information directly in the user’s field of vision. It also allowed users to make calls and take photos. Unfortunately, privacy concerns caused a huge blow to the project, such that it was eventually stopped in January 2015. However, on the project’s official website, it is stated there that the journey of Google Glass has not ended yet. Google also stated that consumers will see the future versions of the smart glasses when they are ready.  Since the Google Glass is not an active product for the time being, this could be the perfect timing for Apple to introduce its own smart glasses, which are now believed to be part of the augmented reality projects of the tech giant. Another project that is making headlines recently pertains to the rumored full VR headset that the company could be launching in the near future.

Kantipur The Kathmandu Post saptahik Nepal Nari Radio Kantipur Kantipur TV 0Shares Share on facebookShare on twitter Entertainment Mi Mix: A vision into the future of smartphones Mi Max is not a perfect phone, but does bring a lot of innovation that could drive smartphone design in the days to come - Prajesh SJB Rana The Mi Mix’s true allure lies in the display of the phone. The device features a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display at a resolution on 1080 x 2040 pixels in a form-factor as big as the iPhone 7 Plus which features a smaller 5.5-inch display Nov 15, 2016- In 2016, we’ve seen a lot of innovative products that have pushed the boundaries of the tech industry. We’ve seen VR technology turn into a reality and we’ve even seen high-quality camera drones that have made aerial shots commonplace in low-budget music videos and films. We’ve also seen Microsoft’s innovative Surface Pro that redesigns how professional content creators work with a computer. While, unfortunately, Google modular phone design concept, Project Ara, was cancelled earlier this year; we got to see their Pixel line of phones which hints at a truly Google phone. Apple, however, disappointed most of their customer base with mediocre improvements to the iPhone line and the MacBook line. In the growing area of consumer technology, Apple seems to be slowly losing their innovative edge. Apple played it safe with both the iPhone 7 and 2016 MacBook Pro releases and while Apple had hinted at a bezel-less iPhone 8, where the company’s true innovation would start. Unfortunately, however, for the Cupertino company, their hopes of awing their consumer-base with a truly innovative device has been cut-short by the Chinese company Xiaomi. The recently released Xiaomi Mi Mix is a technological marvel to behold because of the device’s bezel-less edge-to-edge display. But no matter how innovative Xiaomi’s bezel-less device is, they weren’t the first company to dabble in a phone with a bezel-less display. The first phone to feature a bezel-less display would be the Sharp Aquos Crystal, a phone Sharp released in 2014. While the Aquos Crystal did feature a beautiful bezel-less screen that awed consumers, the phone suffered because of sub-par hardware and a notoriously thick chin at the bottom that worked against the overall aesthetic of the device. The phone also had horrible call-quality issues because of the technology used by Sharp. Sharp used a technology called Direct Wave Condenser, which vibrated the whole screen to produce sound waves that entered the user’s ear. This, which looked great in theory, did not work well in practical use since a lot of the Aquos Crystal users complained of horrible call-quality. The second version of the Aquos Crystal, released in 2015, suffered from similar issues which hindered the overall adoption-rate of the phone. As a result, the Sharp Aquos Crystal phones did not do well commercially and seemed more like a concept phone rather than a phone ready for consumer use. While the Mi Mix is also a concept phone at this point, the true innovation of the Chinese company comes forward in the different ways that Xiaomi has managed to overcome all of Sharp’s initial shortcomings. The Mi Mix has exceptional hardware since it comes equipped with top-of-the line Snapdragon 821 SOC, four or six GB of RAM depending on the model. The device is also equipped with a massive 4400 mAh battery that ensures exceptional battery life. The phone performs exceptionally well on benchmark tests where the Mi Mix beat both the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel. While the Mi Mix performs better than the Sharp Aquos Crystal phones, the phone also implements better technology to ensure better call-quality. While Sharp’s Direct Wave Condenser failed in delivering good call-quality, Xiaomi’s Peizoelectric Ceramic Actuator works exceptionally well. While the technology works by converting electric energy to mechanical energy, slightly similar to the technology used by Sharp, call-quality on the Mi Mix feels natural and easy on the ears. While these specifications and technology might be impressive, the Mi Mix’s true allure lies in the display of the phone. The device features a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display at a resolution on 1080 x 2040 pixels in a form-factor as big as the iPhone 7 Plus which features a smaller 5.5-inch display. The device is a tad bit on the heavier side, weighing at 209g, and is even a bit thicker at 7.9 mm. While I could argue that for such a premium device, Xiaomi should have opted for a QHD display, the display on the Mi Mix actually performs really well. The screen itself is sharp, the colours vibrant and the great brightness at 783 Lux. Watching videos or playing games on the bezel-less 6.4-inch screen is a pleasure. When taking a photo, the way the screen blends in with the real-world is astonishing. But as much as I’ve been advocating the device’s bezel-less screen, it’s not completely bezel-less since there is a visible bezel next to the display but this is so minimal that it can easily be ignored. But taking into account how well the screen looks and performs, the Mi Mix’s screen can be touted as a natural evolution to the Sharp Aquos Crystal displays. But, to utilise a bezel-less display, a lot of compromises have to be made. Since the top chin of any phone contains essential parts such as light-sensors, proximity-sensors and the front-facing camera, having a bezel-less display without the top chin would expose the company to some extremely specific problems. Sharp handled these issues by moving all of the top-chin components to the bottom-chin which is the reason why the Sharp phones featured such a large chin, but the Mi Mix’s bottom chin is thin too. For Xiaomi to reduce the size of the bottom chin, they had to get rid of some essential features like the earpiece and the proximity sensor. Instead of the proximity sensor, the Mi Mix comes with an ultrasound technology that determines proximity with the use of algorithms and software. Without these two components to hog space on the chin of the phone, Xiaomi has managed to considerably reduce the size of the bottom chin; but the smaller front-facing camera and the ambient light sensors have been moved to the bottom. The front-facing selfie camera suffers because of this. Every time you’re taking a selfie, the camera is bound to be obstructed by your finger. Palm rejection technology also needs to be on point on a bezel-less display because while grabbing the phone, your palms are bound to rest on the screen. The Mi Mix is also made out of ceramic which adds to the premium look and feel of the phone. The device is also the first phone to use Zirconia ceramic and the glass feel of the ceramic body makes touch input of both the body and the screen feel seamless. But the main concern here would be durability. By the looks of it, the Mi Mix is not very durable. Accounting how the screen does not have a bezel to protect the screen during an accidental fall or even how ceramic, even though it’s a durable material, is weak on the corners which would be fatal should the phone fall on one of its corners. But the phone looks good enough to turn heads when you use it in front of other people. The Mi Mix also comes in an 18k model, which features the eight GB RAM module that comes equipped with real 18 karat gold rings around the fingerprint reader and the rear camera modules. The use of ceramic also makes the phone slippery and more prone to drops but thankfully, Xiaomi includes a decent leather case for the phone in the box. The Mi Mix is currently marketed as a concept product which is why it has been produced in limited qualities and is available only in China. But even though Xiaomi has labelled the Mi Mix as a concept, it does bring new technology to the field of smartphones. While earlier Xiaomi had been criticised as blatantly copying Apple’s design aesthetics, the Mi Mix is a phone concept that looks original and innovative. There are a lot of flaws on the Mi Mix phones, like how poorly the camera performs on the device or even how the design aesthetics leaves the phone more vulnerable to accidental drops. The Mi Max is not a perfect phone as of right now, but does bring a lot of innovation that could drive smartphone design in the days to come, especially since smartphone designs have been stagnating for a long time. The Mi Mix brings a lot to the table and compromises very little, an effort for which Xiaomi should be lauded. All in all, Xiaomi has managed to create a truly beautiful phone and even though the Mi Mix is not being mass marketed, it is one of the most innovative products to come out this year.

Ad maiorem Dei gloriam inque hominum salutem. Monday, November 14, 2016 Chrome Dev Summit 2016 Day 1 I attended day 1 of Chrome Dev Summit 2016. Here are my notes: Intermission The intermissions between the talks were really entertaining ;) Keynote: Darin Fisher: Chrome Engineering Mission: Move the web platform forward. Over 2 billion active Chrome browsers. Bluetooth beacons are broadcasting the URL for the Chrome Dev Summit website. polymon.polymer-project.org Mobile web usage has far eclipsed desktop web usage. Almost 60% of mobile is 2G. India is experiencing the most growth in people getting online. A lot of Indian users have so little storage space on their phones, they can't afford to install a lot of apps. They routinely install and then uninstall apps. The web works really well in emerging markets. Progressive Web Apps are radically improving the web user experience. He demoed cnet.com/tech-today. It's a progressive web app. He showed a smooth experience even though his phone was in airplane mode. The icon was added to his home screen. 11/11 is singles day in China. It's happening right now. It's the biggest shopping day of the year for them. Alibaba built a Progressive Web App, and it increased conversion by 76%. 53% of users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load. It's all based on the Service Worker API. It lets you control your caching strategy and offline approach. Apps should be interactive within 5 seconds on a 3G connection. Users re-engage 4x more often once you've added the site to the home screen. Prompting users sooners yields 48% more installs. 18 billion push notifications are sent daily. 50,000 domains use push. Seamless Sigh-In using the credential API: -85% sign-in failure, +11% conversion for Alibaba. Lighthouse is a Chrome extension that they built to help you optimize your Progressive Web App. There's a new Security tab in Chrome Dev Tools. Polymer is sugaring on top of Web Components that makes the web platform more capable. Browsers have implemented Web Components, minus the HTML imports part. Polymer App Toolbox makes it easy and fast to prototype a Progressive Web App, and to transition from prototype to real app. beta.webcomponents.org AMP: Accelerated Mobile Pages 700,000 domains are using AMP. developers.google.com/web/ browser-issue-tracker-search.appspot.com: Search for bugs across the major browsers. Progressive Web App Roadshow: developers.google.com/web/events/ He mentioned Web Assembly, WebGL, WebVR, AR (augmented reality) etc. Imagine you walk up to a device. It uses web Bluetooth to share a URL. The URL takes you to a website that allows you to control the device. The website uses web Bluetooth to control the device. Intermission bigwebquiz.com There are a lot of subtle anti-Trump references from the various speakers. Building Progressive Web Apps @thaotran A 1MB download can cost up to 5% of the monthly salary for some people. She talks to lots of companies about being early adopters of web technologies. Flipkart built a Progressive Web App that was really successful. They saw as much traffic on mobile web as on their mobile app on the biggest shopping day of the year in India. Smashing Magazine: A Beginner's Guide to Progressive Web Apps What is a Progressive Web App: it's about radically improving the web user experience. It should be your main web site. developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist has a baseline and an exemplary checklist. She mentioned the Lighthouse Chrome extension. Alibaba conversion rate improvement: +14% iOS +30% Android housing.com was paying $3.75 to acquire new Android users. However, it only cost them $0.07 to acquire new mobile web users. lyft is no longer app only. They built a web app, and they got 5X more traffic than they expected. Android app: 17MB iOS: 75MB PWA: < 1MB makemytrip.com found that for first visit bookings, PWA users book 3X more than often than app users. IBM acquired The Weather Company (The Weather Channel). Things they're talking about: Progressive Web Apps Accelerated Mobile Pages Push Notifications Seamless Sign-In One Tap Checkout Sign-in on the Web 54% of users will abandon rather than register. There's an autocomplete attribute that you can use on your login forms. 92% of users will leave a site instead of resetting login info. g.co/2CookieHandoff: 2 cookie handoff using Service Workers There's a Credential Management API. It's a standards-based browser API. It's in Chrome. Automatically sign in the user on the homepage. AliExpress: 11% increase in conversion 85% drop in sign-in failures 60% decrease in time spent signing in It can work with federated accounts such as logging in with Google or Facebook. Google Smart Lock: the browser remembers your credentials. Then, on another device, it'll automatically sign you in. Nice demo. Google Smart Lock even works with federated accounts. It also works even if you've signed in in multiple ways. Really impressive. g.co/CredentialManagementAPI Faster Web Payments @zachk PaymentRequest. Let the browser help you with checkout. Mobile has 66% fewer conversions than on desktop. Chrome started with autofill. Set autocomplete types on the checkout forms. But, today, he's talking about PaymentRequest. It's a new payments API for the web. It's *not* a new payment method or a processor/gateway. It's a standards-based API baked into the browser. polykart-credential-payment.appspot.com The API is based on native UI. Really seamless. No keyboard usage needed (except typing in the CVC). For now, Chrome supports credit cards and Android Pay. It's really about helping the user avoid filling in a bunch of form fields. The browser can help a lot. Kill the cart: give the user an option to "Buy Now". Think of this as a progressive enhancement. PaymentRequest works best for new users and guest checkout flows. Coming soon: support for third-party payment apps. Integration guide: goo.gl/eLefwM I think this is only mobile for now. Debugging the Web @paul_irish The call stack now looks better, even when you shrink the window. Chrome supports ES6 pretty well. Even in the console, ES6 is supported pretty well. Even async/await. You can now enter multiple lines in console.log without hitting shift return. It indents as you go. It does brace matching. He pointed out that Safari had this first. Tab completion works in the console quite nicely. It even works for arrays once you hit '['. The tab completion works with substring completion instead of just prefixes--just type any part of the word. There's a snippets tab in the sources tab where you can have snippets of code that might be useful. These are persistent. Inline breakpoints: You can place a breakpoint, and then it allows you to drag the breakpoint within the line. Note to self: never use the unauthenticated GitHub API during a demo--you might get rate limited. At the very least, have some static data to use as a backup. The workspaces feature is improved: In Sources: Network: Drag an OS X folder onto the left pane. Without configuration, you should be able to edit your code in Chrome. It works even if you're using transpilation with sourcemaps. There's a new shadow editor. As of today, in the Canary, there's a checkbox with CSS coverage. You hit record, and then start using the site. It'll mark the CSS styles that were never used. He's using iTerm2. node --inspect app.js It gives you a URL. That's the old way. However, in Sources, there's a Node thing under Threads. Then, in Console, there's a context. You can use a single instance of Dev Tools to debug both the frontend and the backend. Application tab >> Manifest: Tells you about the state of your Service Workers. There's also Application >> Clear storage. Application: Service Workers >> Update on reload. Lets you reload the service worker every time. There's also "Bypass for network". That's useful to skip the service worker. He plugged the Lighthouse extension again. It's useful to turn a web app into a Progressive Web App. It also helps audit for best practices. Captures performance metrics too. It's just a Node module. A lot of tools are already building on top of it. You can even set it up for use in CI. Chrome Dev Tools >> Settings >> More tools >> Audits 2.0 is powered by Lighthouse. They wrote caltrainschedule.io. @ChromeDevTools. He's using Visual Studio Code a bit. Polymer, Web Components, & You @TaylorTheSavage "We are at war with phones." #UseThePlatform Polymer is the Chrome team's set of libraries for web developers to take advantage of the web platform. Web components is an umbrella term for a bunch of low-level features. Web components v1 is something today. All major browsers are onboard with everything--except HTML Import, that's still on hold. Cross-browser web components are here. Polymer is a light weight layer on top of Web Components. It's evolved with Web Components. Polymer 1.0 is production-ready. That was released last year. Comcast, USA Today, ING, Coca Cola, EA, etc. use Polymer. It's used by Chrome, Play Music, YouTube Gaming, YouTube (their next version of mobile and desktop app). There's a Polymer App Toolbox that they released a while ago to show how to build full apps: App Components Polymer CLI PRPL Pattern: Use HTTP/2, and push as little as possible. shop.polymer-project.org 75% of mobile connections in sub-Saharan Africa are 2G. It's forecasted to be 45% in 2020. She showed off Jumia Travel. It uses very little data, yet still provides a nice UI. They're working on Polymer 2.0. They just released the preview editing. They're focused on: Web Component v1 support. Better interoperability with other JavaScript libraries. It's truly web native, and looks just like a normal web component. Minimal breaking. There's an interoperability layer. You can incrementally upgrade. Polymer is only 12kb. Mobile web development is hard, expensive, inefficient, slow, and confusing. There are about 500+ apps using Polymer. There's an event system. Use properties, not methods. Use dialog.open = true instead of dialog.open(). Properties go down. Events go up. "Fear driven development." Be afraid of your users. Be afraid of breaking changes. tattoo = Test All The Things Over & Over = it's their repo for testing Web Components. Be afraid of perf regressions. polydev is a tool that you can use to see how expensive the various elements are. polyperf lets you compare the performance between changes. demo-snippets shows you an element and how to use it. It's dynamic, so that you can edit the code. webcomponents.org has re-usable elements. Progressive Performance @slightlylate Great talk! He showed this comic: xkcd.com/1367 "So it takes a lot for me to get to this point. But seriously folks, time to throw out your frameworks and see how fast browsers can be." He mentioned extensibleweb/manifesto. RAIL: Respond: 100ms Animate: 8ms Idle work: 50ms chunks Load: 1000ms to interactive 53% of users bounce from sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load. The average mobile site takes 19 seconds to load. "Your Laptop Is A Filthy Liar": Simulating real devices using Chrome is just not the real thing. Use Chrome inspect in order to use USB to debug real devices. It's really, really hard to hit RAIL on mobile, even with a reasonable phone like a Nexus 5X. "The Truth Is In The Trace". Use Dev Tools attached to real devices. He tests with cheap, slow phones. He doesn't think that emulation cuts the mustard. If you're using a $700 iPhone and assuming the other users are like that, you're wrong. World-wide phones are getting slower as more poor people buy cheap phones. Desktop is 25X faster than a desktop. He added an ice pack to the bottom of a phone in order to keep it cool, and his benchmark ran 15% faster ;) Desktops are faster because they can dissipate more heat. He recommended the paper, "Dark Silicon and the End of Multicore Scaling". We can't use all the silicon in our phones because of the heat dissipation constraints. And the battery has only 10 watt hours. We can't dissipate enough power, and we can't carry enough power. A cell phone battery can't keep a 60W light bulb lit for more than a few minutes. big.LITTLE refers to the technique of having a mix of: Infrequently used "big" (high power) cores Agressively used "little" (lower power) cores You get what you pay for when it comes to mobile devices. "Touch boost": when you touch the screen, it turns on the more powerful CPUs. "Benchmarketing" is a thing. A MacBook Pro has the maximum amount of power stored in a battery that you can bring onto a plane. Nexus 5X has 2 fast cores and 4 slow ones. Flash read performance: MBP: ~2GB/s N5X: ~400MB/s Mobile phones use fewer flash chips which means less parallelism which means slower. Think of mobile phones as having spinning disks from 2008. "High Performance Browser Networking" is a really good book. He highly recommends it. "Mobile networks hate you." "Adaptive Congestion Control for Unpredictable Cellular Networks". What's really killing you is the variance / volatility. LTE speed is actually getting slower. Different markets are wildly different. "A 4G user isn't a 4G user most of the time." -llya Grigorik It's really hard to get anything on the screen in 3 seconds because it takes so long to even spin up the radio. The tools and the methods that we've brought over from the desktop just aren't working. Using the platform well is the only way to go. Today's frameworks are signs of ignorance or privilege or both. It's broken by default. Server-side rendering = isomorphic rendering = universal rendering The Pixel phone is pretty good. Most phones aren't. Scrolling != interaction. We want progressive interactivity. Only load the code that you need right now. shop.polymer-project.org Using HTML imports with tiny scripts means you don't have big bundles that make the thread choke. Service workers lets you return something quickly from cache. The top-level SW shouldn't depend on the network. Don't use a SW that hits the network first. github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse "Mobile Hates You; Fight Back!" Test on real hardware. Use a Moto G4. Use Chrome Inspect on Dev Tools. That'll show you what it's like in the median real world. Use WebPageTest since it lets you use real mobile phones. PRPL is important (but I don't know what it's about yet). The challenge is larger than you think it is. Real Talk About HTTPS @estark37 Over 50% of pages are loaded over HTTPS. www.google.com/transparencyreport/https/metrics For desktop platforms, 75% of time is spent on HTTPS. It's probably on top sites. For some reason, it's somewhere around 33% for Android. They don't know why, but they have a theory that it's because they're those users aren't using sites like Gmail and Facebook like they would be on desktop because they instead use apps for those. Hence, any web usage is most likely for longer tail sites. They're restricting powerful features if you're not using HTTPS. Geolocation is one example. Mozilla is only going to support HTTPS for all new features. istlsfastyet.com: From llya Grigorik. HTTP/2 is only available if you're also using HTTPS. HTTP/2's performance advantages can more than offset the cost of TLS. They have a goal of HTTPS everywhere. At this point, we can't yet use an insecure icon everytime there's a site that uses HTTP. It would just desensitize people to the risk. Let's Encrypt: Free, easy certificates. It's a certificate authority. Chrome made a large donation to Let's Encrypt. It's usage is growing exponentially. All Google sourced ads are already served over HTTPS. developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/enable-https Moving to HTTPS can be done with no impact on search rankings. There's a Security tab in Chrome Dev Tools. It can help. They want to start easing users into thinking that HTTP is bad. Chrome will start saying "(i) Not secure" in the URL bar for pages that have passwords or credit card inputs on them. Building a Service Worker They built a service worker in real time. He used async and await. I think he said it's only in Canary, though :-/ The service worker will look to see if it itself has been updated. He's using VS Code. A Service Worker can be spun down even if the tab is still open. Wow, they keep making the Service Worker more and more complex. It seems like a giant house of cards. There's an offline checkbox in Chrome Dev Tools in the Application tab, and there's also one at the top of Dev Tools. They're not in sync. He's clear that his example is not production code. Cache invalidation is hard. That was some pretty impressive real-time coding. Planning for Performance @samccone "Mobile web" is no longer a subset of the web. It is simply the web. It's more than just responsive CSS. Mobile has been bigger than desktop since 2014. The average mobile web user is not on a $600+ phone. They're more likely to use the free phone you get when you sign up for a plan. The average Android phone has 1G or less of RAM. The average load time for mobile sites is 19 seconds. HTTP2 + link rel="preload" <link href="bower_components/polymer/polymer.html" rel="preload">
 He used this trick to move from 5 seconds to 3 seconds from first byte to first useful paint. H2 Server Push: Push assets from the server to the client before the client even requests them. It's not cache aware. It lacks resource prioritization. But, H2 Push + Service Workers = awesomeness He went from 5 seconds to 1.7 seconds. Preload is good for moving the start download time of an asset closer to the initial request. H2 Push is good for cutting out a full RTT if you have SW support. Older phones are slow when parsing a ton of JavaScript. Event relatively recent phones suffer because of how much JavaScript there is to parse. There is no simple way to see the parse cost of JavaScript. There's some cool new thing in Chrome Canary: V8 internal metrics in timeline Webpack Bundle Analyzer is very helpful to figure out what's in your bundle. Fetch but don't parse: <script src="..." type="inert">
 
 Put it in the page, but don't eval it until you strip the comments out: 
 <script id="inert">
    /* (...) */
</script>
 
 He talked about Webpack require.ensure and the aggressive splitting plugin. Test on real devices on mobile networks. Optimize network utilization: sw, preload, and push for fast first loads. Parsing JavaScript has a cost: ship the smallest amount of JS possible. Predictability for the Web This was a product manager-like talk about making Chrome and the web in general more predictable. The browser companies are working together more and more. He talked about resolving bugs in Blink, the engine behind Chrome. 2/3rds of the top 1% of bugs have been fixed. Using chrome://flags, you can turn on "Experimental Web Platform Features". They fix regressions very quickly. They do want to occasionally deprecate things. Chrome shipped something to improve power substantially by not doing as many request animation frames for iframes not showing. Filing or starring a bug is the quickest way to get your issue resolved. developers.google.com/web/feedback They built a Browser Bug Searcher to search for bugs across browsers. They're trying to treat the web as a single platform. Panel A lot of Google apps aren't Progressive Web Apps. One of the most difficult things to debug in web apps is memory leaks. HTML imports will probably not survive the way they are, but eventually, there will be something better. A few people complained about Chrome Web Apps being deprecated.

The social network has updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content now also applies to fake news. The shift in policy comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter all faced a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election.  Facebook has announced a crackdown on the spread of 'fake news' sits by trying to limit the amount phony sites can make in advertising. The sites were accused of spreading false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters towards Republican candidate Donald Trump. And the debate became so fierce, that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was forced to insist twice in recent days that his social network had no role in influencing the election. But announcing new measures today, a statement on Facebook said: 'We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news', adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.

Share this article Share However, Facebook's steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds. Meanwhile, search engine Google has also said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network. Google's move similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, pictured,  was forced to insist twice in recent days that his social network had no role in influencing the election Nor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. The company said in a statement: 'Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.' The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google's AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service.  Search engine Google has also said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network In a blog post on Saturday, he wrote: 'Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.' Meanwhile, Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. He said: 'One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money. This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.' However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. He added: 'What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 63 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

False news stories have become a sore point after the U.S. presidential elections with critics blaming internet companies like Twitter and Facebook for having had an influence on the outcome of the elections as a result of the fake content. The controversy also reflects concerns about the growing power of social networks to influence people and events, as well as help people to communicate and organize. Facebook promotes democracy by letting candidates communicate directly with people, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said recently in an interview. Google had its own embarrassing moments on Sunday with a false story that claimed that President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the U.S. presidential elections figuring atop some Google search results. Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton is leading in the popular vote. “We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies,” Google said Monday in a statement. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” Google evidently expects that the threat of a cut in revenue from ads will dissuade sites from publishing fake content. Zuckerberg has described as “crazy” the criticism that fake news on Facebook's news feed had influenced the vote in favor of Trump. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,” Zuckerberg said in a post over the weekend. The hoaxes are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics, he added. Identifying the "truth" is complicated, as while some hoaxes can be clearly identified, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted, or expresses a view that some people will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when it is factual, Zuckerberg wrote.

The product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source. The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, the report said. The smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google with its Google Glass product. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart-glasses product would be geared toward information conveyance instead of immersive augmented-reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft's HoloLens. Bloomberg cited sources saying the glasses "may use augmented reality." The project is in "early product testing," the Bloomberg report said. The smart glasses would be designed to connect to an iPhone for processing to keep their weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. A main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be the lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner was Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. Thomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple. A Zeiss representative declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. "I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you," Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah. Apple develops many projects internally, and those efforts often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would most likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market.

Daily Edition Login to download Google to Prohibit Fake News Sites From Using Its Ad Software 5:04 PM PST 11/14/2016 by Natalie Jarvey FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The search giant's move comes after a fake news article topped some search results on Sunday. Google is cracking down on fake-news sites.  The search giant plans to prohibit websites that publish false news from using its ad software, a product called Adsense that allows publishers to place Google ads on their websites.  Google's move, which will cut off a key revenue stream for these sites, comes as fake news has proliferated online, especially on Facebook, throughout the election. Google, too, has dealt with the rise of fake news. Several outlets have reported that on Sunday an inaccurate news story claiming that Donald Trump would win both the popular vote and the electoral college was the top result for some election-related searches.  On Monday, Google responded swiftly. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the move, says the changes are imminent and are in line with Google's existing policies.  A Google spokesperson sent the following statement to The Hollywood Reporter: "We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property." Facebook in particular saw the proliferation of fake news during the election, prompting some critics to question the role the social network played in helping Trump become elected. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that notion "a pretty crazy idea." He then took to Facebook on Saturday to clarify his position, writing that "more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes."  BuzzFeed reported on Monday that some employees at the social network would like to see Facebook clamp down on fake-news posts. Quoting unnamed sources, the online outlet reported that a group of employees have formed a renegade task force whose goal is to offer recommendations to Facebook's senior management about how to handle fake news.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Natalie Jarvey Natalie.Jarvey@thr.com NatJarv Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

The company is working on a policy update to restrict its ads from being served on these sites in an effort to keep inaccurate information off the Web. "We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies," a Google spokesperson told Search Marketing Daily. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the Web property." The policy change to stop AdSense advertisements from serving on pages comes as companies continue to debate the issue as to how much responsibility each site should take for publishing accurate content.  17 SHARES Tags: adsense, advertising, content issues, google, news, search, web sites Recommend (2) Print RSS All content published by MediaPost is determined by our editors 100% in the interest of our readers ... independent of advertising, sponsorships or other considerations.

(Google) ED CARSON 11/14/2016 Reprints Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook (FB) said Monday that they will ban fake news sites from using their advertising networks, after misinformation online become an issue during the presidential election. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. Facebook added fake news sites to misleading, disruptive and illegal sites, which are barred from its Facebook Audience Network. Mobile apps and third-party sites use the Facebook Audience Network to show ads with Facebook. Google's AdSense network is a major source of revenue for many sites. So the Facebook and Google shift could curb the financial incentive for fake news sites. Americans increasingly get their news from Facebook, Twitter (TWTR) and other social networks or search engines, rather than via established media players. That's opened the door for the spread of false news stories. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously said that false stories didn't sway the outcome of the presidential election. Google itself served up fake news on Sunday, with search results for "final election numbers" highlighting a false news story that claimed Trump won the popular vote. Google, which said it's been working on the new policy since before the election, has similar bans on sites with pornographic or extremely violent content. Alphabet shares fell 2.4% on the stock market today while Facebook lost 3.3%, both tumbling below their 200-day moving averages as investors dump big-cap techs. Twitter rose 3.2% after hedge fund Jana Partners disclosed a small stake.

In events like these, they give huge amounts of money to those who can show them vulnerabilities that can be exploited either in hardware or software. PwnFest – held in Seoul, South Korea – was one such event and it was here that the Google Pixel was again compromised after being hacked in a similar contest a week ago. The end goal for contestants in these events is usually to gain control of a device through remote code execution. Here, Google’s brand spanking new flagship phone fell to hackers from Qihoo 360 who gained control of the smartphone via Chrome. The exploit resulted in the hackers able to take control of the device and launching Chrome which displayed a page that said, “Pwned By 360 Alpha Team”. The Qihoo 360 team won USD$120,000 as cash prize for that specific hack. The Chrome vulnerability was patched within 24 hours of the event. The week before, in a similar event in Japan, the Google Pixel was also compromised – that time via a zero-day exploit which is still unpatched up until time of writing. The team of white-hat hackers took home total prize money amounting to USD$520,000 – all for exposing vulnerabilities in devices and software, so that those companies can patch up those gaps and weaknesses in the security of their software of devices.

Coren Obsession 2016 November 14, 2016 No more dollars for fake news. (Reuters/Peter Power) Share Written by Michael J. Coren Obsession 2016 November 14, 2016 Silicon Valley is being forced to come to terms with the idea that it may bear some responsibility for the information passing through its servers. Google announced on Nov. 14 that it’s working on a policy that will restrict ads placed on fake news sites. A Google spokeswoman told Reuters that a policy change for its AdSense advertising network is imminent. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” she said. AdSense is at the heart of many publishers’ revenue model. The statement did not give details on whether it would affect products such as DoubleClick that target and deliver ad campaigns, and the policy does not address hoaxes appearing in Google search results. The announcement comes as Facebook faces harsh criticism for allowing false information to be spread among its users ahead of the US presidential election. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised to “find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful,” despite characterizing claims that the company had a significant role in the election’s outcome as a “pretty crazy idea.” That response has failed to impress, even to those inside Facebook. BuzzFeed reported today that a group of Facebook employees has formed to tackle the company’s role in promoting fake news on its own. “It’s not a crazy idea,” one Facebook engineer told Buzzfeed. “What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season.” Fake news sites that feed false, inflammatory information to a credulous American public have risen as a way to make easy money. In a BuzzFeed investigation, 140 websites dedicated to US politics were traced back to a small Macedonian town called Veles (population 45,000), where young men churned out stories “aggregated, or completely plagiarized, from fringe and right-wing sites in the US.” Since it’s cheap to register a domain, and set@an up shop overseas, junk sites like worldpoliticus.com, TrumpVision365.com, and USConservativeToday.com can be easily manufactured and unleashed on social media networks, where the clicks can be turned into revenue. Google itself has fallen victim to this type of news. Recent weeks have seen fake articles rise to the top of Google’s vaunted rankings, with obscure websites promoting the (false) idea that Trump is leading in the popular vote placing above reputable news organizations in searches. Reality is what people collectively believe. pic.twitter.com/KJANDTkUzA — Aza Raskin (@aza) November 14, 2016 Google’s attempt to cut off these sites from ad dollars won’t be easy, said Rob Leathern, founder of online advertising and payment software company Optimal. “The reason fake news sites exist is the advertising revenue,” he said in an interview. “But it’s not as easy as flicking a switch and turning off the revenue.” There are sites around the world are dedicated to circumventing Google’s controls. Unscrupulous owners can buy existing AdSense accounts online that may help evade the new policy. Simply determining if a site is “fake” will be a challenge. Since the financial incentive is there, it will be hard to stamp out. A fake viral news hit can rake in $1,000 or more in banner advertising dollars from ad networks run by Amazon.com, Google, and Revcontent, said Leathern, who analyzed fake news sites in a recent Medium post. And AdSense is only part of the online advertising ecosystem. As long as these sites continue to drive real traffic, they’ll likely be able to find ways to make money off them.

"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," a Google spokesperson told Reuters. According to The Wall Street Journal, Google said the policy would apply to fake news sites, a move that would cut them off from the world's biggest seller of pay-per-click ads and thus much of their income. The search giant told Reuters it began working on the policy update before the election. Concerns about fake news online, however, have intensified in recent days as commentators have slammed sites like Facebook and Google for facilitating the spread of misinformation to voters. On the day of Google's announcement, for instance, a false news story was returned as the top result for the search "final election results." That same day, Gizmodo reported that Facebook developed a tool to identify fake news stories and chose not to use it. Of course, it remains to be seen if Google will actually enforce the new policy. If it does, however, the search giant could strike a major blow against the growing fake news industry.

(Regis Duvignau/Reuters) Related Stories Only Facebook knows how it spreads fake election news Housing and job ads on Facebook will no longer exclude users based on race Facebook sorry for 'terrible error' that killed off still-living users Google's search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump "70 News" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to "70 News" remained prominent in its results. Political bots spread misinformation during U.S. campaign Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing fake news sites. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google spokeswoman Andrea  Faville said. The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. Fake news on steroids False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. A link to this story on 70 News appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results — even though it's completely bogus. (CBC) Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. Only Facebook knows how it spreads fake election news Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 per cent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its "trending" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. 'Failure of the algorithms' Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. "In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 per cent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. 'When algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.' - Ken Doctor, Newsonomics Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. "What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm," Doctor said. "These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings." It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. © The Associated Press, 2016 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines Royal Bank hikes mortgage rates — especially for loans of 25 years or longer read comments Liberals to revamp 'discriminatory' age law for anal intercourse video Energy companies' unpaid electric bills sent to Alberta farmers CBC News crew captures airstrikes in east Aleppo video Ottawa rabbi wakes to find swastika, racial slur spray-painted on her front door Latest Technology & Science News Headlines Twitter announces new features to curb cyberbullying Defibrillator-equipped drones could be 1st on scene in cardiac arrest Ban Ki-moon, Hollande call on U.S. to respect Paris climate deal Dakota Access pipeline delay a political tactic, company says Young scientists pen letter to Trudeau urging environmental assessment overhaul read comments Quirks & Quarks Quirks & Quarks for October 15, 2016 Cosmic rays causing ‘space brain,’ berries turning birds' feathers red, and the book 'Venomous' Quirks & Quarks for October 8, 2016 A Nobel prize winner in chemistry, theory of mind in apes, and diatoms save the ocean Most Viewed More than 412 million adult-website credentials hacked Google says it will crack down on fake news sites What you need to know about the supermoon Social media is blinding us to other points of view November supermoon will be the closest to Earth since 1948 Microsoft Surface Book review: Who needs a $4,000 laptop?

Google moves to restrict ads on fake news sites Reuters 15 hrs ago By Julia Love and Kristina Cooke © REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this file photo illustration taken in Berlin Alphabet Inc's Google said on Monday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of "fake news" and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters towards Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google's move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. MACEDONIA NEWS AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic," he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the programme, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. "One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money," he said. "This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites." However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. "What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialised knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale," he said.

Xiaomi Mi Box review: Android TV elevated with cheap 4K HDR streaming At just $69 with 4K HDR, voice search, and Google Cast capabilities, the Mi Box is the first Android TV device with mainstream appeal. Jared Newman (TechHive (US)) on 14 November, 2016 23:00 0 - - - - print email Xiaomi’s Mi Box, the cheapest 4K HDR streaming box on the market, comes from two names you might not be familiar with. The box is built by Xiaomi, a Chinese electronics vendor that has largely avoided the U.S. market until now. As for the software, the Mi Box runs Android TV, a big-screen operating system Google launched a couple years ago, then promptly began neglecting in favor of the more popular Chromecast. The Xiaomi Mi Box is the first new Android TV streaming box since mid-2015, and it comes with a strong pitch: For $69, you get 4K HDR video, a voice-controlled remote, a speedy processor, and Google Cast built-in. That simple formula goes a long way toward covering up some of Android TV’s deficiencies. Svelte set-top, pointy remote The Mi Box is surprisingly compact, running four inches wide and deep, with a tapered design that’s about a quarter-inch thick. It’s smaller than the latest Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku Ultra and Premiere boxes, yet it has some robust tech specs including a 2.0 GHz quad-core processor, 8 GB of storage, 2 GB of RAM, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Apps load quickly, with no major performance hiccups even in heavyweight apps like PlayStation Vue. Xiaomi didn’t leave room for optical audio, but the box does include an output for headphones or S/PDIF audio connections. And while there’s no built-in ethernet port, the full-sized USB port supports USB-to-ethernet adapters, along with external storage drives and game controllers. Google has even been experimenting with USB tuner support in Android 7.0, which in the future could allow users to watch and record over-the-air antenna channels through the set-top box. Jared Newman The Mi Box has a USB port, HDMI output, and audio output for headphones and S/PDIF connections. The Mi Box can also stream in 4K at up to 60 frames per second, with HDR-10 to be enabled with Android 7.0, but you’re on your own to find supported content. There are no shortcuts to apps that offer Ultra HD video, akin to the “4K Spotlight” app on Roku players. And because Amazon Video isn’t supported on Android TV, one major source of 4K and HDR content is unavailable. (Current 4K sources include Netflix, YouTube, Vudu, Ultraflix, and Sony Ultra.) As for the remote control, Xiaomi aim for minimalism. There are no fast forward, rewind, or pause buttons—those functions are just built into the directional pad—nor are there menu or app shortcut buttons like you’d find on a Roku remote. However, the Mi Box remote does include volume controls, which you can adjust up to the maximum you’ve set on your TV, and a power button that puts the box to sleep. Those are worthy trade-offs in my view. My only grip is that the remote’s sharp edges can dig into your palms depending on how you hold it. The Android TV torchbearer Where the Mi Box starts to falter is with the Android TV operating system. Android TV is adequate at the basics, offering plenty of major streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, HBO, Showtime, CBS All Access, Crackle, and Starz. (Some notable exceptions: Amazon Video, NBC, and NHL.TV.) Android TV also has built-in Google Cast support, which lets you launch videos from streaming apps on phones and tablets, and from websites in Google’s desktop Chrome browser. This helps fill in some gaps from Android TV’s native app catalog, and can be faster than thumbing through menus with a TV remote. Still, Google’s living room platform never rises above mere adequacy. It’s lacking the pleasant touches found on other streaming boxes, such as the private headphone listening on Roku’s remote controls and mobile app, or the Alexa virtual assistant built into Amazon’s Fire TV devices. Android TV also fails to execute on some of its more ambitious ideas. The Recommendations bar that sits atop the home screen is largely useless, with limited participation from streaming services, no sorting options, and a tendency among some apps to be clueless about what they’re suggesting. (WatchESPN, for instance, keeps offering days-old football reruns instead of live sporting events.) Android TV’s Live Channels app, which is supposed pull live video sources into a unified channel grid, is similarly stunted, with support from only six streaming apps. Sling TV and PlayStation Vue don’t make their live feeds available, and Pluto.tv channels consistently fail to load. Android TV’s Recommendations row is a smart idea that’s rarely useful in practice. Even Google seems to treat Android TV as an afterthought. There’s no Google Photos app on the Mi Box, YouTube’s design is out-of-date compared to other TV platforms, and the Google Play Music app lacks ad-supported radio stations. And while voice search is a powerful feature—supporting complex queries like “80s comedies” and showing results from across different apps—it could really use a visual overhaul to streamline the long list of results it generates. Better yet, it could act more like the virtual Assistant that’s built into the new Google Home connected speaker. One other caveat with the Mi Box in particular: It comes with some bloatware in form of 16 “Mi Box Recommends” app links. The apps aren’t all installed to begin with, and while they are removable, you have to install them before you can uninstall them. They also occupy a separate space from your main app list, making navigation a bit more confused. Pre-installed apps like Netflix aren’t allowed to mingle with your regular app lineup. Who’s the Mi Box for? At least for streaming devices like the Mi Box, Android TV still has the air of an enthusiast platform. Although it’s rough around the edges, but it allows tech-savvy users to sideload any Android app they want, and it supports the popular media player software Kodi. For gaming, you can install all kinds of console emulators to create your own retro gaming box. USB TV tuner support could also be a boon for cord cutters, assuming Google finalizes it, and Xiaomi upgrades the Mi Box to Android 7.0. The $69 Mi Box, however, is the first Android TV streamer whose appeal reaches beyond tech enthusiast circles. Though it fails to offer the flourishes and forward-thinking ideas of other streaming platforms, it succeeds as a cheap streaming device with 4K HDR video, solid performance, and voice search. Those same features would cost $30 more on a Roku, and Amazon’s $90 Fire TV doesn’t support HDR video at all. The Mi Box even matches the price of Google’s own Chromecast Ultra, while offering a proper remote and big-screen interface. On top of all that, you can buy the Mi Box at Walmart, the largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the United Sates. Maybe that’s enough to put Xiaomi—and Android TV—on the map.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Syaz This would be amazing… Jason van de Laar Another awesome Giveaway! andrew konken I’ve been a long time Telus customer and this is the only device I would even consider upgrading to. Everything about the phone just looks absolutely amazing. I finally got a chance to see one in the mall last week and I couldn’t help but find my fingers fondling it’s screen and touching the fingerprint sensor. Plus it would be nice to have a phone with a half decent camera. Each time I’ve gotten a new phone in the last 6-7 years the devices I’ve picked have been plagued by camera issues. Unfortunately I’m on an old grandfathered 6GB data plan and it would cost me more in plan fees over the 2 years than the device is worth, and I just don’t have the coin to pony up for one. Mobilesyrup would make my Christmas/Year if I won this. danhenny_76 its too bad telus has ‘minimum monthly contracts’ now -id love to get this phone but will i give up my $65/m with 5gig data plan? never vn33 With the in-market plans these days, I may as well stay with the best data plan I can get (such as yours) and buy my own phone.

Mark Zuckerberg said last week that he doesn’t think fake news swayed the election at all. And as Mediaite’s Dan Abrams wrote yesterday, a pretty glaring piece of fake news appeared when searching for the final Election 2016 vote count. Well, The Wall Street Journal reports today that Google plans to take action: Google said Monday that it is updating its policies to ban Google ads being placed “on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose” of the website. The policy would include sites that distribute false news, a Google spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, over at Facebook, BuzzFeed has a report out tonight saying that there are Facebook employees who are setting up an “unofficial task force” to combat fake news. That task force is apparently very upset with Zuckerberg completely dismissing the impact of fake news on the election: “It’s not a crazy idea. What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” said one Facebook employee, who works in the social network’s engineering division. Zuckerberg said in a post this past weekend that he wants Facebook to do more to crack down on fake news. For the record, back in early 2015 Facebook said it was going to crack down on fake news. And now there are employees concerned that they haven’t done nearly enough: The group plans to formalize its meetings and eventually make a list of recommendations to Facebook’s senior management. Another Facebook employee said while the task force remained small, “hundreds” of Facebook employees had expressed dissatisfaction with the company’s stance on fake news in private online chats, and wanted to support efforts to challenge that position.

Most Popular Google last month quietly bought Undecidable Labs, a startup founded by a former Apple director that focused on turning online searches into purchases, according to a person familiar with the deal. The acquisition suggests that Google, the largest unit of Alphabet, is making further moves to tie its massive library of online image links with a revenue stream. Earlier efforts around online commerce have delivered mixed results at Google. The company's mobile payments have yet to see significant pickup. Its comparison shopping service, which facilitates online purchases within search results, has growing traction with advertisers, according to external estimates. Cathy Edwards, founder of Undecidable Labs, now oversees engineering and product development for image search at Google, a spokeswoman for the internet giant said on Monday. The representative declined to comment further. Undecidable Labs, based in San Francisco, had raised less than $1 million in financing, according to a person with knowledge of the startup. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters.

She formed Undecidable Labs in early 2015. The company had yet to release a product. Stefanie Kraus, a designer listed as an employee of the startup, described its effort on her website as creating a "purchase research tool" for online shoppers. "By introducing a filtering system that takes `nice to have' and `ideal' into consideration, we make sure that the products are presented in a meaningful way," Ms. Kraus wrote on her website. Li Fan, who previously led engineering efforts for Google image search, left the company in September. She moved to Pinterest, the online discovery site that some analysts see as a viable contender for e-commerce spending and search advertising dollars now flowing to Google. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Online Publishing Search Shopper Marketing Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Eyes on Sarkozy as fresh claims of Gaddafi funding arises ProjekMMO: Penyanyi Siti Sarah nafi pitam dirasuk jin Ikatan calls for ban on Bersih 5, Red Shirts to prevent bloodshed Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article Seat, Samsung and SAP join forces at Mobile World Congress 2016. — AFP picSEOUL, Nov 15 — One of the first things Samsung Electronics Co President Young Sohn said when talking about the South Korean company’s US$8 billion (RM34.7 billion) deal to buy Harman International Industries Inc is that the electronics giant has no intention of building a car. The emphasis was intentional. Samsung’s target customers are carmakers who’d love to give their vehicles smartphone-like capabilities but are leery of surrendering unfettered access to their dashboards. They’ve largely kept a distance from Google, which could mine driver data for its own uses, or Apple Inc, which until recently had designs on building its own car. Samsung wants to marry its consumer electronics expertise and the fast 5G cellular network it’s developing with Harman’s presence in dashboards all over the world. If it works, they can offer carmakers a lightning-quick connected system for infotainment, mapping, concierge services and autonomous driving — and all without the worry that the automakers would be helping a future competitor. “This is not about building a car,” Young said in an interview. Several automakers “came to us and asked us to help with technologies like 5G, or artificial intelligence or memory. We can harness technologies to provide a better experience to automakers.” Samsung offered US$112 a share in cash for Harman, which was 28 per cent above the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s closing price of US$87.65 in New York on Friday. The stock closed up 22 per cent to US$109.72, the biggest gain since its 1986 initial public offering. Samsung’s own shares rose on the deal, which was announced after the market closed yesterday. The stock climbed as much as 1.8 per cent as of 9:45am in Seoul. The acquisition reverberated through the car business, with Wells Fargo analyst David Lim saying in a research note that the deal could “ignite additional mergers and acquisitions of higher technology auto suppliers.” The shares of automotive electronics maker Visteon Corp. jumped 9.6 per cent — the most since August 2012 — and larger rival Delphi Automotive Plc gained 2.2 per cent. Deals like Samsung’s for Harman could be welcome by automakers, who want to control the revenue from connected car services and the customer data it generates as much as possible, said Jim Hines, a research director at Gartner. ‘Competitive dynamic’ “There is definitely a competitive dynamic that has emerged between the established automotive industry and these large tech companies that are looking to get a piece of that market opportunity,” Hines said. As automakers have rolled out connected services in their cars, they have been very careful in how they work with Google and Apple. General Motors Co allows its customers to connect their smartphones into the dashboard through Apple’s Car Play and Google’s Android Auto — but only with selected apps, and the phones cannot access a car’s data. Toyota Motor Corp. doesn’t allow its cars to connect to either system. The fear among carmakers is that Apple and Google could either mine the data inside the car, tracking everything from driving patterns to engine performance, to either become a new face to the consumer or to help them build cars. The fact that Harman is already a supplier and that Samsung doesn’t have a system that competes with the in-car connected services sold by carmakers could make them a more attractive partner, Hines said. Partner or threat? “They might be viewed as less of a threat in terms of tech partner for some of these leading automotive brands,” Hines said. Samsung wants to become a high-tech supplier capable of building connected systems. Its expertise is making the hardware, like microprocessing units, and a faster 5G network to deliver more data to cars faster. Harman sells — among other technologies — 3D navigation, apps for integrating other devices into the car, active safety systems and audio systems that can access the cloud. There are a lot of opportunities once the companies combine, Harman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in a phone interview. Imagine a car that that can read a driver’s daily schedule and automatically dial into a conference call, Paliwal said. Autonomous driving will only give drivers access to more connected capabilities for work or entertainment, he said. “We’ll be in the best possible position because we have all the capabilities,” Paliwal said. Overcoming weaknesses Assuming the merger goes through, Samsung will need to develop other capabilities, especially in software, said Cyrus Mewawalla, lead analyst at CM Research. Like Google and Apple, Samsung wants to own and provide the servers, the hardware that’s doing all the computing and the memory storage for connected cars. They also want to own the platform that runs the apps, in the way that Apple’s iOS and Android do now. While they have expertise in some things like microprocessors, they don’t have all of those capabilities, Mewawalla said. “They’d need more than just this acquisition,” he said. “The two key weaknesses Samsung has is the software ecosystem and cloud infrastructure, and that’s where it needs to be acquiring.” Artificial intelligence, in which Samsung has recently made a deal, should be a particular area of focus in the near future, he added. If it chooses, the company could also have the resources to develop such capabilities on its own once Harman’s 8,000 software engineers and join Samsung, which spends US$13 billion a year on research and development and US$23 billion in capital expenditures. “Imagine the scale of our R&D,” Paliwal said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Bursa Malaysia ends higher on window-dressing, higher oil prices Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week MMOTV: Time to show up with daughter, Indira tells ex-husband NYT Video: ScienceTake — how dolphins know who’s who Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal (VIDEO) Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Samsung Electronics to invest more than US$1b in US chip production Samsung Electronics’ third quarter profit guidance beats estimates despite Note 7 woes Samsung targeted by activist investors to restructure company Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Google to Prohibit Fake News Sites From Using Its Ad Software The Hollywood ReporterNovember 14, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google is cracking down on fake-news sites.  The search giant plans to prohibit websites that publishnews from using its ad software, a product called Adsense that allows publishers to place Google ads on their websites.  Google's move, which will cut off a key revenue stream for these sites, comes as fake news has proliferated online, especially on Facebook, throughout the election. Google, too, has dealt with the rise of fake news. Several outlets have reported that on Sunday an inaccurate news story claiming that Donald Trump would win both the popular vote and the electoral college was the top result for some election-related searches.  On Monday, Google responded swiftly. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the move, says the changes are imminent and are in line with Google's existing policies.  A Google spokesperson sent the following statement to The Hollywood Reporter: "We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property." Facebook in particular saw the proliferation of fake news during the election, prompting some critics to question the role the social network played in helping Trump become elected. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that notion "a pretty crazy idea." He then took to Facebook on Saturday to clarify his position, writing that "more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes."  BuzzFeed reported on Monday that some employees at the social network would like to see Facebook clamp down on fake-news posts. Quoting unnamed sources, the online outlet reported that a group of employees have formed a renegade task force whose goal is to offer recommendations to Facebook's senior management about how to handle fake news.  Read more: Mark Zuckerberg Says It's "Crazy" to Think Facebook Influenced the Election Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Obama says Trump soon to face sobering 'reality' check AFP Melania Trump Wore a $1,655 Fiery Red Dress for 60 Minutes Interview Lauren Tuck Black veteran says he was refused free Veteran's Day meal at Chili's after man in Trump shirt questioned his service Business Insider Trump supporter beaten on West Side explains why he didn't fight back WLS – Chicago President Obama suggests Hillary Clinton is to blame for stunning election loss International Business Times UK Obama: World must guard against ‘crude’ nationalism, racism Yahoo News Stunning photos of the supermoon Yahoo News Video Ohio State student arrested after tackling anti-Trump speaker Yahoo News Miami Marlins Jose Fernandez dies in boating accident Yahoo News Photo Staff Where Are They Now?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google to treat fake-news websites like porn and ban its ads from them By Ethan Baron / November 14, 2016 at 5:19 PM What you read here is true. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for the rest of the internet. Although the web has been serving up fake news since its inception, the rise of social media has fueled a rise in the number of websites that acquire revenue-generating traffic via outrageous and often false stories shared widely on social media. The most recent presidential campaign brought this issue into the light, with Facebook taking significant heat over made-up news stories in its news feed. And on Nov. 14, Google felt some of the fire as well: Searches for “election results” brought up, in the top position, a false report by “an obscure right-wing blog” that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote. But Google is now taking a stand against fake news. The company’s AdSense program connects website operators with advertisers, and is “the most popular tool for monetizing websites,” according to the Wall Street Journal. But AdSense also “helps fund some fake-news sites,” the Journal reported. Now, Google is putting together a policy update that will keep its ads off fake news sites, the firm told Reuters. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters, adding that the change was imminent. The new policy will put fake news into what might be described as Google’s basket of deplorables: types of websites the company doesn’t want its ads running on. “Google has long prohibited AdSense from being used on sites that promote hate speech or include pornography and violent content,” according to the Journal. “Its policies previously didn’t include language about sites that spread false content.” A spokeswoman told the paper that the new policy would parallel existing bans on ads that misrepresent what they’re selling. In other real news about fake news, California assemblywoman Melissa Melendez (Lake Elsinore) apparently prefers the latter and disdains the purveyors of the former. The Republican politician, revealed to have tweeted a link to a fake report about anti-Trump protesters fatally injuring a veteran. The website in question, the Christian Times Newspaper, has also presented articles saying that Hillary Clinton had filed for divorce and that she and her husband Bill were “actively involved in child sex trafficking,” the Los Angeles Times reported.   But it wasn’t the fake-news site Melendez took aim at when she was called out for tweeting a link to falsehood. She instead took a shot at purported bias in the mainstream media. “I had a bet with my husband that liberal reporters would flip out over a news story I shared. I won $20 thanks libs,” she tweeted, according to the Los Angeles Times. Photo: A man walks past a building on the Google campus in Mountain View.

Starting this week, the company's Google Play Music streaming service will begin to use it, as well. Google's newly revamped Google Play Music will leverage machine learning techniques to first figure out an individual listener's music tastes and preferences. The app will then combine other factors like time of the day. user location, activity and weather to suggest what it judges to be the most appropriate music for that situation. Google Play Music will serve up different, customized playlists depending on whether the listener is at work, relaxing at home, working out, flying, or in the library. "Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library," explained Elias Roman, lead project manager for Google Play Music in a blog post. Google Play Music will serve up the music suggestions via a new home page that is customized for listeners based on music preferences. The goal is to ensure that the music that a user is most likely going to want to listen to at any moment is always on top of their home screen. Like many other mobile applications and services from Google and other developers, Google Play Music will be available in an offline mode when the user is not connected to the Internet or is in a location with poor connectivity. In such instances, subscribers to the server will get an offline playlist populated with recently listened to songs, The new Google Play Music will start becoming available to subscribers this week. It will be available on Android iOS and the Web version of Google Play Music. The updated app is being rolled out on a global basis and will be available in more than four dozen countries initially. Google Play Music service allows users to load up to 50,000 songs from their devices to the cloud from where they can play it anytime on any Android, iOS and Web accessible device from anywhere around the world. The service boasts a 35 million-song catalog across a wide variety of genres. Music listeners, who sign up for the $9.99 per month—or $14.99 per month per family per month—service get full, ad-free access to the catalog. People who subscribe to Play Music also get access to YouTube Red, Google's ad-free video and gaming service. At least some of the features that Google announced this week were previously available through Songza, an online music streaming service that Google acquired in 2014 for an undisclosed sum. Songza gave users the ability to listen to contextual playlists curated by experts and boasted of the ability to serve up song ideas based on location, time of day, activity and similar factors, just like Google announced this week.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. Alphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election.  (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College, according to the Associated Press.) "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said in a email statement. The results popped up under a Google search banner called  "In the News" when a user searched for "who won the popular vote." As of Monday evening, the blog's post was still there, though it followed stories that referenced the erroneous results. In the News is different from Google News (news.google.com.) The blog's publisher said it had based its information on "twitter posts" over the weekend, specifically one from user @koxingA8. The dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. Most news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN, according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. Later Monday, Google said it would remove sites it had found to be providing fake news from its advertising program. The erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. Facebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is "authentic," and has vowed to weed out fake news. Late Monday, the company said it would pull ads from fake news sites. USA TODAY Facebook employees form fake news task force “In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news," Facebook said in a statement. "While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance." USA TODAY Zuckerberg vows to weed out Facebook 'fake news' A group of Facebook employees, meanwhile, have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report.

However, the Chinese company reportedly turned Google down because the search giant insisted that its brand should be the only one adorning the Pixels. When Huawei execs heard that the Huawei logo wouldn't be on the phones, they turned Google down. That was all rumored information, however, up until now. German publication WinFuture spoke to Colin Giles, Huawei's Vice President of the Consumer Business Group, about the matter. And he pretty much confirmed the earlier report. Simply put, the fact that Google wanted the Pixels to only bear its own brand was found unacceptable by Huawei, a company that is striving to make its name more well known in developed markets. That aim would not have been helped in any way if Huawei were to act as a mere contract manufacturer for the Google Pixel phones, so the company chose not to further the hardware development cooperation it started with Google last year, when working on the Nexus 6P. Interestingly, Giles says Huawei doesn't see Google as a direct competitor. Of course, if the Pixel line becomes even remotely successful sales-wise, that perception may change.

The tech giant is set to punish websites violating its Safe Browsing standards by applying a “Repeat Offender” tag, eweek reported. The change, announced in a Google blog post on Nov. 8, is set to begin this week for users of Google Chrome and other browsers. The warning will remain in place for a month and only be taken down if Google believes the site no longer poses a threat. The “Repeat Offender” tag was developed to combat sites that are intentionally harmful and duplicitous. In the past, those sites would typically remove the security issue after being flagged by Google – but just for long enough to get the Safe Browsing warning removed. Then the initial security issue would pop back up. “As a result of this gap in user protection, we have adjusted our policies to reduce risks borne by end-users,” Brooke Heinichen, a member of the Safe Browsing Team, wrote in the Google blog post. Safe Browsing has been available to users on desktop and Android systems since December. More than 2 billion Internet-connected devices worldwide are protected by Safe Browsing, DigitalTrends reported.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) SAN FRANCISCO - Google's search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump "70 News" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to "70 News" remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that "misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information." The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 per cent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its "trending" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as "crazy " in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that "more than 99 per cent of what people see" on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task. "Identifying the 'truth' is complicated," Zuckerberg wrote. "While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted." The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS?

"In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 per cent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. "What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm," Doctor said. "These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings." It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 per cent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research's survey earlier this year, with 22 per cent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - In this March 23, 2010, file photo, the Google logo is seen at the Google headquarters in Brussels.

It's well-crafted and has a comfortable keyboard, a vibrant screen, fast performance and even longer battery life than last year's model. As ever, you'll pay dearly for the privilege, and the relatively heavy weight and imbalanced weight distribution make it less portable than lighter systems. With that heft, though, comes incredible battery life and no shortage of port options. It doesn't completely reinvent mobile VR, but it's a good stepReview: Google's Daydream View VR headset Google's Daydream View is here, and it's a solid first attempt at a mobile VR headset from the company that gave us Android. Importantly, it's comfortable, and VR experiences look great. The only problem is there aren't many apps available for it yet -- and we need more Daydream-compatible phones. At the moment, users are limited to Google's own Pixel handsets. Daydream streamerYouTube's VR app is Daydream-only for now Now that Google's VR platform is available, it's launched the official VR app for YouTube. You'll need the new phone and headset to access it, since it's not on any other platforms yet, but now you can watch anything from the streaming site in its virtual confines. That includes 360-degree videos, or just regular stuff projected on an imaginary screen, along with voice search and all your existing subscriptions.

Google's search engine is highlighting an inaccurate story claiming that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in the Nov. 8, 2016, election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) SAN FRANCISCO — Google's search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump "70 News" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to "70 News" remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that "misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information." The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. Fake news on steroids False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. Social media and the news Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its "trending" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as "crazy " in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that "more than 99 percent of what people see" on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task. "Identifying the 'truth' is complicated," Zuckerberg wrote. "While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted." The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. More, better algorithms? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. "In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. "What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm," Doctor said. "These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings." It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said.

 Apple is working on smart glasses Kif Leswing Nov. 14, 2016, 7:00 PM 9,809 facebook linkedin twitter email print Not a real photo of Tim Cook. AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images Apple is working on a pair of smart glasses. The product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source. The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, the report said. The smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google with its Google Glass product. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart-glasses product would be geared toward information conveyance instead of immersive augmented-reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft's HoloLens. Bloomberg cited sources saying the glasses "may use augmented reality." The project is in "early product testing," the Bloomberg report said. The smart glasses would be designed to connect to an iPhone for processing to keep their weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. A main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be the lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner was Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. Thomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple. A Zeiss representative declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. "I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you," Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah. Apple develops many projects internally, and those efforts often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would most likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market.

The decision comes at a critical time for the tech industry, whose key players have come under fire for not taking neccesary steps to prevent fake news from proliferating across the web during the 2016 US election. It’s thought that, given the viral aspects of fake news, social networks and search engines were gamed by partisan bad actors intending to influence the outcome of the race. Fake news easily goes viral, and Silicon Valley is letting it happen unabated "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," a Google spokesperson said in a statement given to Reuters. This policy includes fake news sites, the spokesperson confirmed. Google already prevents its AdSense program from being used by sites that promote violent videos and imagery, pornography, and hate speech. The issue of fake news on social media grabbed national attention earlier this summer, when Gizmodo reported that the team at Facebook responsible for its Trending Topics news list was suppressing links from conservative sources. The controversy called into question Facebook’s role as a primary source of news for tens of millions of Americans. The episode reportedley “paralyzed” Facebook, according to a recent report from The New York Times, leaving its leadership unwilling to make any drastic changes to the News Feed to curb the viral growth of fake news. Zuckerberg says it’s ‘crazy’ to think Facebook influenced the election In fact, earlier today Gizmodo reported that Facebook had developed a tool to identify fake news on its platform, but chose not to deploy it for fear it would disproportionately affect conservative websites and cause more right-wing backlash. As it stands, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has denied his company’s role in influencing the election, calling the idea “crazy” and downplaying yet again the characterization of Facebook as a media company. Google appears to be taking a more active role, and for good reason. Just this past weekend, a fake news link rose to the top of Google search results for the question “who won the popular vote,” falsely claiming the answer to be President-elect Donald Trump. Now, it seems those sites that have learned to game the search and social network algorithms of Silicon Valley’s most influential companies may lose a crucial source of funding going forward. - Source: Reuters In this Storystream How social platforms influenced the 2016 election Facebook employees reportedly forming secret ‘task force’ to address fake news Google will soon ban fake news sites from using its ad network What we know, and what we don’t, about Facebook’s effort to reduce hoaxes View all 17 stories More From The Verge China's right: smartphones are a big reason Trump can't win a trade war Donald Trump is about to control the most powerful surveillance machine in history A Tribe Called Quest’s new album is tear-jerking, essential protest music Watch Dogs 2 is exactly what the original game should have been Predicting Westworld: so it’s Lost MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future WhatsApp opens up video calling to everyone The Walking Dead Redemption Club season 7, episode 4: Service This Article has a component height of 10.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. Alphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election.  (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College, according to the Associated Press.) "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said in a email statement. The results popped up under a Google search banner called  "In the News" when a user searched for "who won the popular vote." As of Monday evening, the blog's post was still there, though it followed stories that referenced the erroneous results. In the News is different from Google News (news.google.com.) The blog's publisher said it had based its information on "twitter posts" over the weekend, specifically one from user @koxingA8. The dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. Most news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN, according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. Later Monday, Google said it would remove sites it had found to be providing fake news from its advertising program. The erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. Facebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is "authentic," and has vowed to weed out fake news. Late Monday, the company said it would pull ads from fake news sites. USA TODAY Facebook employees form fake news task force “In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news," Facebook said in a statement. "While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance." USA TODAY Zuckerberg vows to weed out Facebook 'fake news' A group of Facebook employees, meanwhile, have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report.

Of course depending on your skill and how you judge distance and space, you could make a three-point turn, or you might even up taking more turns, like 5 or 7, but basically there is skill involved. Recently it seems that this is a skill that Google has taught its self-driving cars. In their monthly report that Google releases to keep the public informed of their progress, Google revealed that the three-point turn is a skill that their self-driving cars have recently managed to master, thanks to bevy of cameras and sensors placed around the vehicle that helps them see things that human drivers might otherwise miss. According to Google, “Our self-driving cars, on the other hand, can see a full 360 degrees, measure distance down to a few centimeters, and precisely calculate the quickest path for the car. Our cars don’t just follow a few standard turns either. We’ve taught them to adapt to all kinds of variables — including dead end streets stacked with parked cars, trash bins littered on the curbs, and narrow bottlenecks.” Google also noted how they wanted to make it so that their cars would perform the turns naturally, as in how a human driver would do it, which is why they have opted to use maneuvers that humans would do as opposed to doing something a robot might, like going back and forth in small and short movements, or reversing all the way.

INNOVATE How This World Ranked Gamer Became an Amazon Millionaire (And How You Can Too) Making money online is just like a video game. You just need to know the rules. By Leonard Kim Leonard Kim is managing partner at Build Your Influence, a personal branding accelerator. He's a Top Writer on Quora, an online knowledge market. On the side, Leonard writes books, speaks at events, and blogs at LeonardKim.com. He resides in Los Angeles and loves cupcakes. @MrLeonardKim Managing partner, Build Your Influence@MrLeonardKim WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement People shop for products all the time. But the way they shop is changing. Google is becoming the place people research products, while Amazon is what most people use as the final destination when it comes to ordering. Right now, there's over 2 million Amazon sellers trying to capture their stake in the billions that Amazon does in revenue. And just like in the world of gaming, only a small percentage of these sellers out there are actually making money on the platform. Former world-ranking gamer and co-founder of Domazon, Steve Tinkle, believes that there is one thing you need if you want to succeed as an Amazon seller. You must understand the unwritten rules of the game before attempting to claim any level of success in it. After testing his theories on hundreds of products across multiple categories, Steve decided to offer his take on listing creation and management to other sellers as a service. And just like that, Domazon was born. I recently sat down with Steve and discussed the steps he took to learn what is necessary to win the game of Amazon selling: 1. Work on your side hustle Just like video games, Domazon wasn't Steve's full time project. In fact, it all started as a side hustle. At the very beginning, Amazon wasn't even on his radar. He first got tuned in when a friend was selling products through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and was displeased with the results. Steve's friend knew there had to be a problem because another seller was having much better success with a similar product. Unsure of what to do, his friend reached out to Steve and brought him on board to help solve the riddle and improve the listing's performance. Steve approached this project the same way he approached competitive gaming. Learn, plan, execute and adapt. Figuring out how to successfully sell this product was a challenge that, if accomplished, would bring the same level of satisfaction as winning a game against an online opponent. His strategy to success followed the formula that has brought him enormous success with video games. The approach was simple: create a perfect listing in the eyes of Amazon's algorithm, develop the perfect launch strategy, execute the perfect marketing strategy and tweak as needed to achieve rapid growth. In just 12 months, Steve's system was working in a way that nobody expected. He managed to make one listing generate five figures in revenue per year and turned it into a full product line grossing over eight figures. It became clear to Steve that there was an enormous amount of opportunity to succeed on a high level if you have the rules down. 2. Build a team and delegate Once Steve saw the potential for this success, he decided to start selling products on his own. But after hitting a few roadblocks, Steve recruited friends to his team. Working with the right people was another lesson that he learned from his gaming days. Through gaming, Steve learned that he should let team members do what they are good at and focus on coordinating the collective struggle in the same direction. The skill of managing a team of remote players during live gaming action proved an incredible asset once put to use. One of his first hurdles was the cost of fulfilling a rather large order from a manufacturer in China. A friend saw the opportunity and agreed to finance the order. Steve guaranteed that he would double his money within nine month, but sales went so well that he was able to pay back the debt in under two months. 3. Struggle, but build resilience Steve says they don't call it Amazon for nothing. He feels the online marketplace is a jungle. It's often hard to defend the attacks of others and survive. The last hurdle turned out to be more like a continuous struggle than a solvable problem. Steve says that Amazon as a company isn't always the easiest with whom to work. With so many active sellers, sorting through truth about term of service (TOS) violations and maintaining a sense of true justice is a challenge. Steve explained that when he started to get more sales and increased the ranking on his keywords, that other competitive sellers would game the listings by upvoting negative reviews down voting positive reviews, posting fake reviews and more. He felt that just like in the world of gaming, sometimes the players attack each other to win. Steve doesn't support these "black-hat" tactics, but he has learned to deal with them to protect his business. Through all of the struggle, he developed a set of policies, procedures and principles that have helped him keep his sanity and guide his business decisions. Steve had stated that a smart person learns from their mistakes, but a wise person learns from the mistakes of others. And Steve uses that statement as the core foundation to his business, by helping others achieve the best results possible through real-world experience. Have you had success by taking gaming principles and applying them to business? I'd love to learn more! Comment below.

Internet conference sponsored by Beijing likely to highlight competing visions of controlling cyberspace and using it to grow economy PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 15 November, 2016, 1:28pm UPDATED : Tuesday, 15 November, 2016, 11:28pm Comments:   Jane Cai Mandy Zuo Share PrintEmail Related topics Censorship in China Related Articles Policies & Politics China pushes through cybersecurity law despite foreign business fears 8 Nov 2016 Policies & Politics China’s top internet regulator lays down the rules on live-streaming programmes 4 Nov 2016 Insight & Opinion Propaganda and censorship remain China’s favoured tools of control 4 Oct 2016 Liu Yunshan, the No 5 in the Politburo Standing Committee and in charge of ideological control, doesn’t look like an internet guru or a man who can influence the future of one of humanity’s great inventions. Elevation of Liu Yunshan heightens censorship fears Yet the 69-year-old senior cadre will be the keynote speaker at the third World Internet Conference, an event organised by the Chinese government. He will instruct a gathering of leading lights of China’s internet industry, as well as guests from dozens of developing countries, on how to build “a community of common future in cyberspace”. At last year’s conference, President Xi Jinping voiced the idea of “cyberspace sovereignty”, an unambiguous announcement that Beijing will step up its censorship and control of the internet. The Chinese Communist Party is trying to match its social control in the real world in the virtual world. The country has a huge online police team patrolling the internet, requires pre-licensing for performing or broadcasting online, and is enhancing the “Great Firewall” as a border control line to keep unwelcomed barbarians like Google and Twitter out. China’s Great Firewall of web censorship not a trade barrier, says nation’s internet regulator But the internet is also a booming business and a way of life in China, a country of 1.3 billion people. Literally everyone is now connected via their phones, and online shopping, cashless payment, mobile taxi-hailing and virtual entertainment services in Beijing and Shanghai are as widespread and sophisticated as in New York and Tokyo. Chinese online service firms, including Alibaba – which owns the South China Morning Post – and Tencent Technologies, are now among the world’s biggest and most powerful. It is against this backdrop that communist party leaders hope to allow a booming business-wise internet while maintaining rigid ideological control. “China will continue to pursue a leadership role in global cyberspace governance,” said Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based historian and political analyst. “But China is unlikely to achieve concrete results, since most developed countries are shunning the internet conference. Those with underdeveloped internet infrastructure are more interested in the economic benefits, rather than internet control.” What are the next big things in the world of high technology? Let China’s internet giants tell you Most overseas guests will be from developing countries, from Cambodia in Asia to Comores in Africa. There will be a conspicuous absence of speakers from big name global internet firms like Google, Apple or Twitter. Alibaba’s Jack Ma, Tencent’s Pony Ma, Baidu’s Robin Li and Netease’s Ding Lei will be the heavyweight participants at the event. This year’s conference starts on Wednesday in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. It has sessions on cybersecurity, smart health care, the mobile internet and China’s One Belt, One Road infrastructure scheme. The theme is “Innovation-Driven Internet Development for the Benefit of All – Building a Community of Common Future in Cyberspace”. The event would see China seek “enhanced international cooperation” to cope with the “complicated world economic situation, risks and challenges”, said Ren Xianliang, deputy director of the Cyberspace Administration in Beijing last month. China has been trying in the past few years to strike a deal with conference participants on “cyber governance”. Such an agreement would give international recognition to the way Beijing has been managing the internet, but observers are not optimistic that such common ground can be found. China to strive for greater clout on the internet through global governance system Huang Chengqing, vice-chairman of the Internet Society of China, said it was unlikely Beijing could achieve any kind of agreement with participating countries during the summit. The Internet Governance Forum, another annual global meeting that saw wider participation, had never reached any consensus since its establishment in 2006, he said. “It’s an issue of seeking balance for each country. Different countries have different understandings on what is harmful information, as they have different religions and values, or are at a different phase of growth.” Xu Longdi, from the China Institute of International Studies, also doubted if China could promote its own system of internet governance to other countries through the forum. “It’s a nice try to establish a platform, to invite people to speak out on their opinions and show them an open-minded and cooperative China. But we really need time to see whether this can be accepted by others.” The problem for Beijing is that it wants to contain the role of the internet in fanning radical social changes, in the way social media facilitated the Arab Spring movement. But it also wants to use the internet to upgrade its economy. “We will try to amplify the positive effects of the internet, and minimise its negative effects,” Ren, the cyberspace official, said. Chinese have no need for websites blocked by Great Firewall, says Beijing official But this will be hard to do, since restricted information flows hurt economic activities. For instance, China’s controversial cybersecurity law, which will further strengthen Beijing’s grip on information, was passed this month and comes into effect in June 2017. The law, which required firms to store key data in Chinese servers and hand over encryption codes to authorities, could run against the country’s Industry 4.0 vision of an enhanced industrial economy, according to German ambassador to China Michael Clauss. “Fast, secure and transnational internet access is a decisive factor for economic growth and innovation. But in China, the balance between security and online innovation is more and more tipping towards security,” Clauss said in a recent interview. “The digital environment in China is becoming so restrictive, observers are starting to speak of the ‘world’s largest intranet’,” he said.

GET IN TOUCH       Ghana News Ghana News, Ghana Politics, Ghana Sports, Ghana Business           Home Business Politics Elections Sport Showbiz Odd But True Opinion Relationship Lifestyle Infographics Photo Gallery TV Facebook’s fake news crisis deepens Tuesday 15th November , 2016 5:44 am Despite the best efforts of Mark Zuckerberg to downplay Facebook’s role in the election of Donald Trump, the scrutiny of how fake news is spread on the platform has intensified. Buzzfeed News is reporting that “more than dozens” of Facebook employees have created an unofficial task force dedicated to addressing the issue. Buzzfeed quoted one member of that task force, who did not want to be named over fears for their job. “[Mark Zuckerberg] knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” the source said. Facebook has not responded to the BBC’s request for comment on Buzzfeed’s report. Meanwhile, Google on Monday announced it would do more to prevent fake news sites from making money through advertising. Agitated Zuckerberg Earlier on Monday Facebook denied claims that a tool to whittle out fake news had been created before the election, only to be shelved due to concerns it would make Facebook look like it was censoring conservative views. Mr Zuckerberg appears to be increasingly agitated by the suggestion that fake news was a serious problem on his site. On Saturday night he posted a lengthy update to his profile page defending it. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” he wrote. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics.” His conclusion: “Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.” That statistic – 99% – has been the subject of much derision as it apparently refers to content of any kind being posted to Facebook. In May, Facebook came under heavy criticism after it was alleged that human editors working on the Trending Topics section of Facebook were removing stories that pushed a conservative or pro-Trump agenda. Facebook denied this was the case, but removed the human element anyway in an attempt to appear neutral. Google action Facebook is not alone in coming under fire over fake news. Google said it would be clamping down on abuses of its AdSense advertising platform. “We will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” said Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville. That announcement followed reports that Google’s top-ranking news result for the term “final election result” highlighted a story from a fake news site with inaccurate information on the vote tally. Not long after Google’s announcement, Facebook said it too had added “fake news” to the types of site not allowed to use the Facebook Audience Network, a system similar to Google’s Adsense but smaller in scale and limited to third-party apps. Facebook said its decision was about clarity rather than any new policy, and that no action was being taken against any service as a result. – Source: BBC Marian Efe Ansah More on citifmonline.com Flippy Campus launches online marketplace for tertiary students November 14, 2016 Facebook to do more tackling fake news November 14, 2016 Facebook wants to make you secure November 13, 2016 Facebook bug ‘kills’ users in ‘terrible error’ November 12, 2016 Spotify patches ‘data gobbling’ glitch November 11, 2016 13 year old honoured internationally for feats in tech space November 11, 2016 General News We will present members for questioning but… – NPP November 15, 2016 We’ll win, but don’t be complacent – Akufo Addo tells supporters November 15, 2016 Mahama opens Kwame Nkrumah Interchange project [Photos] November 14, 2016 Burkinabe arrested for gruesome murder of school principal November 14, 2016 UK threatens to deny visas over election violence in Ghana November 14, 2016 Advertisement Recent Posts Industry must partner with Universities to tackle unemployment – VC We will present members for questioning but… – NPP Real power belongs to the masses not pollsters – Ablakwa ABL wins Beverage Industry of the Year Award We’ll win, but don’t be complacent – Akufo Addo tells supporters Midea launches new air conditioners in Abidjan [photos] Facebook’s fake news crisis deepens Obama seeks to allay Trump concerns Mahama opens Kwame Nkrumah Interchange project [Photos] Eyewitness News, Monday, November 14th, 2016 Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2016 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

Photo: Reuters Apple Inc.’s next hot product category may be...Google’s failed Glass project from 2013. The company is considering glasses that could combine digital information with what a person sees, my Bloomberg News colleagues reported late Monday. If the idea sounds familiar, it’s because of the similarity to technology behind Pokemon Go, the hit smartphone game of 2016. It was also the aim of Google Glass, before the company now called Alphabet Inc. put that project on hold for reprogramming. Apple’s possible foray into a similar field isn’t immediately inspiring. That’s not to say the company needs to be first in digital glasses or augmented reality—a catch-all term for technology that mixes real-world images with computerized information or digital images—to be the best. Apple has a track record of taking not-entirely-original and niche ideas and transforming them into something grander. Apple cribbed the idea for the Macintosh from unused research at Xerox. There were digital music players before the iPod. There were smartphones before the iPhone. Tablet computers preceded the iPad. In each case, however, Apple made technology that was better, easier to use—even magical. That Apple magic turned fringe products into mainstream ones, and reshaped the trajectory of the technology industry. That was the Steve Jobs version of Apple. After more than five years with Tim Cook at the helm, we’re still not sure if this Apple can make the leap from niche idea to world-changing technology. The first major product debut under Cook, the Apple Watch, hasn’t yet become an obvious hit. (To be fair, no other companies have found major success with wearable computers.) More ominously for Apple, it’s no longer the technology trendsetter. Yes, Apple has brought us better smartphone cameras and fingerprint sensors, but there are more areas where it has whiffed. Cook has been saying for five years that the TV industry is broken and needs an overhaul. He was right. Now the way people watch television is being upended by Netflix Inc., by “cord cutting” and by video on smartphones. Apple is barely a participant in that transformation. Apple is developing technology that could some day become the operating system for driverless cars, but it’s not obvious that the company has a clearer vision than Google, Baidu Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Tesla Motors Inc. or other companies that are further ahead on autonomous driving. Apple bought Siri more than six years ago to bring voice-activated digital helpers to smartphones. Since then, Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft Corp. have surged ahead. Apple may never make digital glasses, and if it does, it won’t happen before 2018. But the technology will progress anyway. Augmented reality is what Microsoft is doing with its HoloLens headset, and that product exists. So does Pokemon Go. The parent company of Snapchat created a specialized camera built into glasses that lets people record snippets of video from what they see. Snap Inc.’s Spectacles are no doubt less ambitious than any Apple plan for wearable computers on the face, but the point is that companies other than Apple are illuminating the path for the rest of the industry. Cook has said that the doubling of Apple’s research-and-development spending in the past three years was in part devoted to cooking up Apple’s next big product. It certainly could use a dose of inspiration. The company just closed its first fiscal year of declining revenue since 2001. Its major products—the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers—may never return to the growth they once had. We might look back at 2016 as a lull before a storm of ground-breaking product categories. More likely, though, Apple’s days as technology’s unrivaled innovation factory are over. Bloomberg Gadfly’s Tim Culpan contributed to this column.

The rapid growth of these pages combines with BuzzFeed News’ findings to suggest a troubling conclusion: The best way to attract and grow an audience for political content on the world’s biggest social network is to eschew factual reporting and instead play to partisan biases using false or misleading information that simply tells people what they want to hear. This approach has precursors in partisan print and television media, but has gained a new scale of distribution on Facebook... ...The reality is that people who frequent these hyperpartisan pages on the right and on the left exist in completely different segments of the online world, rarely interacting with or seeing what the other side is seeing. The more they rely on these pages for information, the more polarized they will likely become — and the more their worldviews will be based on information that is misleading or completely false. Inside Facebook’s (Totally Insane, Unintentionally Gigantic, Hyperpartisan) Political-Media Machine Such news exists primarily within users’ feeds, its authorship obscured, its provenance unclear, its veracity questionable. It exists so far outside the normal channels of news production and distribution that its claims will go unchallenged. The “They Had Their Minds Made Up Anyway” Excuse If Facebook was a tool for confirmation bias, that would kind of suck. It would. But that is not the claim. The claim is that Facebook is quite literally training us to be conspiracy theorists. And given the history of what happens when conspiracy theory and white supremacy mix, that should scare the hell out of you. The forces that drove this election’s media failure are likely to get worse In a column just before the election, The New York Times’ Jim Rutenberg argued that “the cure for fake journalism is an overwhelming dose of good journalism.” I wish that were true, but I think the evidence shows that it’s not. There was an enormous amount of good journalism done on Trump and this entire election cycle, from both old-line giants like the Times and The Washington Post and digital natives like BuzzFeed and The Daily Beast. (There were plenty of good broadcast reporters on the beat as well, though what appeared on air left a lot to be desired.) For anyone who wanted to take it in, the pickings were rich. The problem is that not enough people sought it out. And of those who did, not enough of them trusted it to inform their political decisions. And even for many of those, the good journalism was crowded out by the fragmentary glimpses of nonsense. Renegade Facebook Employees Form Task Force To Battle Fake News “Facebook, by design, by algorithm, and by policy, has created a platform that amplifies misinformation,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has been vocal in the need for social media to consider their role in spreading fake news. Google to Bar Fake-News Websites From Using Its Ad-Selling Software Google said Monday that it is updating its policies to ban Google ads being placed “on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose” of the website. The policy would include sites that distribute false news, a Google spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg Continues to Defend Facebook Against Criticism It May Have Swayed Election Google Docs: False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and Satirical “News” Sources Tips for analyzing news sources: - Avoid websites that end in “lo” ex: Newslo (above). These sites specialize in taking a piece of accurate information and then packaging that information with other false or misleading “facts.” - Watch out for websites that end in “.com.co” as they are often fake versions of real news sources. - Watch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story. Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event. - Odd domain names generally equal odd and rarely truthful news. - Lack of author attribution may, but not always, signify that the news story is suspect and requires verification. - Check the “About Us” tab on websites or look up the website on Snopes or Wikipedia for more information about the source. - If the story makes you REALLY ANGRY it’s probably a good idea to keep reading about the topic via other sources to make sure the story you read wasn’t purposefully trying to make you angry (with potentially misleading or false information) in order to generate shares and ad revenue. - It’s always best to read multiple sources of information to get a variety of viewpoints and media frames. Some sources not specifically included in this list (although their practices at times may qualify them for addition), such as The Daily Kos, The Huffington Post, and Fox News, vacillate between providing legitimate, problematic, and/or hyperbolic news coverage, requiring readers and viewers to verify and contextualize information with other sources. Conspiracy theories: How to be a smarter news consumer. This isn't an election thread. Current election thread is here. posted by triggerfinger (81 comments total) 59 users marked this as a favorite   Facebook's Fight Against Fake News Was Undercut by Fear of Conservative Backlash posted by T.D. Strange at 9:00 PM on November 14 [13 favorites] This is a perfectly timed post. I've just starting blocking all of the hyper partisan (on either side) 'news' sites from my Facebook, and replacing them with reputable journalists. I never cared before, but the bullshit that people hear and believe on facebook, including myself sometimes, is too much after this election cycle. If I'm the first person in my friends that stats reading the real news again, at least I can hopefully convince someone else to pay attention, too. posted by motioncityshakespeare at 9:02 PM on November 14 [4 favorites] Over the weekend I ended up on the Fox News site reading a story about the NYT letter re: reporting accuracy, truth, etc. After making the mistake of scrolling down to the comments I noticed a significant amount of people bemoaning that the "liberal rag" in question was in fact STILL lying because they were reporting Clinton as leading in the popular vote while that was no longer the case. Trump was now leading by 500k-600k votes, they insisted. In my skeptical confusion I scrolled just to the top of the page to the live election counter on the Fox News website itself, which was accurately reporting the roughly 700k and growing lead Clinton still indeed had. Earlier today I told my friend this story and even telling it gave me extreme anxiety about HOW to get through to people that are so willfully ignorant that they've completely abandoned all notions of critical thinking, research, analysis, etc. How do you deal with someone who won't accept, or won't SEE, the readily available information (from a source they trust) that clarifies their own misinformation. Many on the left have made the point that you have to begin crafting arguments against Trump and figuring out ways to get the correct information to the categorically misinformed, but goddamn does it seem like a Herculean task at this point. posted by dreamlanding at 9:16 PM on November 14 [28 favorites] This tidbit from the NYT article is the most 2016 thing possible: Then, of course, there’s the content, which, at a few dozen posts a day, Nicoloff is far too busy to produce himself. “I have two people in the Philippines who post for me,” Nicoloff said, “a husband-and-wife combo.” From 9 a.m. Eastern time to midnight, the contractors scour the internet for viral political stories, many explicitly pro-Trump.posted by theodolite at 9:18 PM on November 14 [2 favorites] I've been thinking about this a lot.

Wiki-fact? There's definitely a need. posted by notyou at 9:26 PM on November 14 [2 favorites] Forgot this one: The ‘Filter Bubble’ Explains Why Trump Won and You Didn’t See It Coming In a 2015 study run by Facebook data scientists and published in Nature, researchers set out to test the filter-bubble hypothesis by looking at ten million de-identified Facebook users who self-reported their ideological affiliation over a six-month period. They found that users only clicked on 7 percent of “hard” content (politics, national news) in their feeds, as opposed to “soft” content like entertainment, sports, or travel. The researchers found that conservatives see about 5 percent less ideologically diverse content than their more moderate friends, with liberals at 8 percent. The Facebook algorithm, they concluded, makes it 1 percent less likely that people are exposed to cross-cutting content. More than anything, it’s the friends you have: “We show that the composition of our social networks is the most important factor limiting the mix of content encountered in social media.” While “news feed” is clever, sticky branding, it’s more “’my friend’s opinions’ feed.” Notably, the study with the largest data set on Facebook virality, out earlier this year, found that feelings of dominance predicted sharing, while arousal — getting angry or upset — predicted commenting. posted by triggerfinger at 9:28 PM on November 14 [1 favorite] goddamn does it seem like a Herculean task at this point. Some of that is even just from the lack of basic civics knowledge. You have a conversation with someone, and they say something ...odd. So you probe a little bit and you find out they have no idea how Congress works, or something basic about the Constitution, or what have you. So you end up going back to step one and they argue with you about really basic factual matters and it's exhausting. posted by Blue Jello Elf at 9:32 PM on November 14 [21 favorites] In a column just before the election, The New York Times’ Jim Rutenberg argued that “the cure for fake journalism is an overwhelming dose of good journalism.” Shortly after the election: To Our Readers, From the Publisher and Executive Editor As we reflect on the momentous result, and the months of reporting and polling that preceded it, we aim to rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of Times journalism. Followed by all the things they wish they'd done, and an exhortation to pay them for good journalism. Phooey. That's the same paper that unflinchingly published bullshit that marched us to war in 2003. posted by adept256 at 9:44 PM on November 14 [22 favorites] I've been thinking about this a lot. I hope there are smart well-resourced people who'll start really taking this seriously; I wish I knew what the solution is. I think that unless Facebook (and Twitter and Google) is on board, any effort that anyone else makes is like spitting into the wind. This kind of confirmation bias is a powerful thing. There are tools already in place; a few ideas thrown out in some of the articles above: Buzzfeed: “There is a lot more we could be doing using tools already built and in use across Facebook to stop other offensive or harmful content,” said a second Facebook employee who has been a longtime engineer there. “We do a lot to stop people from posting nudity or violence, from automatically flagging certain sites to warning people who post content that doesn’t meet the community guidelines,” the employee said. He added that while Facebook users were encouraged to flag fake news, the guidelines for removing that sort of content were not clear. “If someone posts a fake news article, which claims that the Clintons are employing illegal immigrants, and that incites people to violence against illegal immigrants, isn’t that dangerous, doesn’t that also violate our community standards?” Neiman Lab: What can Facebook do to fix this problem? There are ideas out there, many of them problematic in their own ways. One simple one would be to hire editors to manage what shows up in its Trending section — one major way misinformation gets spread. Facebook canned its Trending editors after it got pushback from conservatives; that was an act of cowardice, and since then, fake news stories have been algorithmically pushed out to millions with alarming frequency. Another idea would be to hire a team of journalists and charge them with separating at least the worst of the fake news from the stream. Not the polemics (from either side) that sometimes twist facts like balloon animals — I’m talking about the outright fakery. Stories known to be false could be downweighted in Facebook’s algorithm, and users trying to share them could get a notice telling them that the story is fake. Sites that publish too much fraudulent material could be downweighted further or kicked out entirely. Would this or other ideas raise freedom of speech or other thorny issues? Sure. This would be easy to screw up — which is I’m sure why Facebook threw up its hands at the pushback to a human-edited Trending section and why it positions itself a neutral connector of its users to content it thinks they will find pleasing. I don’t know what the right solution would be — but I know that getting Mark Zuckerberg to care about the problem is absolutely key to the health of our information ecosystem. posted by triggerfinger at 9:45 PM on November 14 [11 favorites] This is going to continue to be one of the most serious threats to democratic society. Right now, I can only foresee it getting worse. posted by Vic Morrow's Personal Vietnam at 9:48 PM on November 14 [15 favorites] Cite your source. Cite your source. Look for first-person sources. Check the timing of the article (old news may often be inaccurate). Is it measurable (objective vs subjective, fact vs opinion)? Who is paying for this information? Local news, advertisers, public relations groups? Are there ties with other, more biased groups or organizations? Just because it is in print, does not make it valid. Just because it is repeated in several resources (cut and paste), does not make it valid. Information, entertainment, influence: which is the driving force for this particular news outlet? Anybody can put anything on the internet. No accountability, no fact-checking, no consequences for sloppy or bias reporting. A few well-run news outlets with high standards and both internal and external checks for accuracy are better resources. The problems are finding those resources, and staying alert for shifts in editorial policy. posted by TrishaU at 9:52 PM on November 14 [5 favorites] Oh look, we're catching on now to the glorious internet revolution and its freedom of boundless paperless expression that will surely bring on utopia. posted by Miko at 9:58 PM on November 14 [9 favorites] On source evaluation: something I picked up from university librarians is the CRAP Test. There are various versions out there to Google. Currency How recent is the information? How recently has the website been updated? Is it current enough for your topic? Reliability What kind of information is included in the resource? Is content of the resource primarily opinion? Is it balanced? Does the creator provide references or sources for data or quotations? Authority Who is the creator or author? What are their credentials? Who is the publisher or sponsor? Are they reputable? What is the publisher’s interest (if any) in this information? Are there advertisements on the website? Purpose/Point of View Is this fact or opinion? Is the creator/author trying to sell you something? Is it biased? posted by Miko at 10:01 PM on November 14 [30 favorites] So I was reading the Buzzfeed article and got to this paragraph: Left-wing pages wrongly claimed Putin’s online troll factory was responsible for rigging online polls to show Trump won the first debate, falsely said that Trump wants to expel all Muslims from the US and said US women in the military should expect to be raped, claimed that TV networks would “not be fact-checking Donald Trump in any way” at the first debate, and completely misrepresented a quote from the pope to claim that he “flat out called Fox News type journalism ‘terrorism.’” And I'm like "uh... what?" I thought all of these things were true. I wish that Buzzfeed had shared their doc with their research because when I went to see if I could find out about the thing about the online troll factory (which I could have sworn was true) I found the original Occupy Democrats post and a couple of copies but nothing that seemed particularly trustworthy. posted by bleep at 10:07 PM on November 14 [4 favorites] Facebook pages are tabloids. Pure and simple. Get something outrageous on an image, post it and hope it brings enough new users to like, visit or whatever the end game is. When people only consume cheerleading from their own echo chamber and lock out every person even those on the "same side" but disagreeing on some things, they are missing out there's more than those echoes. A lot more. I get it is extremely taxing to deal with so much bullshit, but the alternative is thinking our own social circles are fully representative of the population. But the problem is where to start cleaning up this mess - It's the post-factual age of dank memes and hot takes, after all. Everyone is so addicted to 140 char. opinions, video takedowns and easily digestible infographics, there's no room for nuance. Maybe listing resources, journalists and personalities who can say "yes, but" without coming up with some unsourced bs or a straw man to look balanced could be a start. Maybe force Facebook to have a review editorial board where pages presenting an abnormal number of fact checking reports to carry a "this page is deemed untrustworthy" between header and every post until valid sources are presented. But that's worth nothing if people aren't willing to change themselves or learn where's bullshit when they read it. (Apologies if something does not make sense, writing on mobile) posted by lmfsilva at 10:12 PM on November 14 [1 favorite] Facebook's Fight Against Fake News Was Undercut by Fear of Conservative Backlash Makes a kind of sense. Zuckerberg can't not know how confirmation bias works, or why people aren't engaging with content they say they're presenting. Publicly supporting Trump, also makes sense, as far as protecting FB. He's apparently been appeasing conservatives for a while, since they got irritated when he expressed some more humane views (which seem more aligned with stuff he's doing with his spouse, like that Cure Everything charity). On a related note, until recently, I could access some NYT articles without subscribing or logging in, but now you have to log in to most news sites that do actual reporting using FB or Google. I'm not sure that's great for access and spread of information (while preserving anonymity). Although actually funding reporting somehow is also critical. Dilemma. posted by cotton dress sock at 10:16 PM on November 14 The researchers found that conservatives see about 5 percent less ideologically diverse content than their more moderate friends, with liberals at 8 percent. What does this sentence mean? Liberals at "8 percent less (?)"... compared to that "5 percent less" for conservatives? Less than what? Average? People grouped as being in the middle of the political spectrum? Is this supposed to be seen as a strong effect? It sounds weaker than I would have expected, actually (and I think the study authors agreed with that interpretation). posted by atoxyl at 10:20 PM on November 14 [4 favorites] This is going to continue to be one of the most serious threats to democratic society. I agree. And I am deeply concerned -- probably this issues has shaken me more than anything else during this election period. It is a cultural issue, one of values and integrity... things that I used to think were widely held American values that made me proud to be an American. If it can't be fixed, it will be dark times. But how does one effect cultural change? That is what's needed. posted by brambleboy at 10:24 PM on November 14 [4 favorites] 1980s: Tech will make you smart 1990s: Tech will make you free 2000s: Tech will bring people together 2016: oops shit sorry guys posted by RobotVoodooPower at 10:28 PM on November 14 [86 favorites] I think what makes me despair about this is that I feel like you can treat the symptom but not the disease. Maybe Facebook can stop fake news from distributing this way. I definitely think they should be making the effort. But the truth is that a lot of people in my life do not seem to care what the truth is. They don't care about the factual truth of news stories any more than they care about the factual truth of climate change or evolution or whether gay people are decent parents or anything else along those lines. They share stories like this like they share glurgy stories of Christmas miracles. They were things people shared with each other to make themselves feel better--in this case, about supporting a candidate like Trump, but it's not like that's new. It's just the continuation of a trend of people sharing these sorts of stories to make themselves feel better about attending anti-gay churches, or to make themselves feel better about being scared of black people, or whatever. It's every story about the kid who almost got aborted who grew up to be a missionary brain surgeon, every story about a white person being a hero for doing some incidental bit of work in Haiti or whatever. I didn't think there were that many people like this in this country, but I know enough people who were like this long before the election that I'm not at all surprised by people behaving this way in this context. Whatever stories they have to invent to justify their prejudices, they'll keep doing it. It's easier with Facebook, but god knows they were doing it easily enough with email forwards before that. posted by Sequence at 10:30 PM on November 14 [25 favorites] Yeah, but as you say, Sequence, it's easier with Facebook. It lets id run riot. (There was some kind of common ground when everyone was tethered to one of three 9pm broadcasts. People might have spun off into their own orbit after the fact, but they at least watched roughly the same things.) posted by cotton dress sock at 10:40 PM on November 14 [5 favorites] I'd be very interested to see Google let an independent nonprofit do a deep dive into their indexed pages to trace attribution back to original sources and pair that with information on who owns those sources, information on trustworthiness from reputable curators, users flagging false stories*, things like that to provide some kind of Context API other services can use to give users a nice red/yellow/green reputability system with a click through for more information on how that particular story was rated. *If you could build a system that identifies a good amount of known reputable stories that can basically be used as test cases and you constantly audit more random stories by hand to fact check and find more known reputable stories, then reviewers who consistently flag reputable sources as false could be filtered out as noise and you might have a workable flagging system. And maybe the system is weighted more towards flags from longer term users with consistently good flagging, with brand new users' flags not being worth much, to discourage brigading to game the system. You could probably also spot brigading patterns as they emerge and pump the brakes. idk, I don't know what the solutions are but having easy access to lots and lots of data to figure it out would be a good first step towards something that might help. posted by jason_steakums at 10:42 PM on November 14 [1 favorite] And hey, I don't know if this would be a huge nightmare for the mods but maybe we could get a flag on Metafilter for false news? It's not like we're immune here, especially when the comments start flying fast. I figure if you flag that, you'd better come prepared with sources to back you up, since it shouldn't entail sending the mods out on a research project. I know I'd rather have a comment of mine with an inadvertent link to false news scrubbed than letting it stand, I'd rather not contribute to shitty discourse because I got hoodwinked myself. posted by jason_steakums at 11:00 PM on November 14 [8 favorites] Gabler said it best, in his election post-mortem (emphasis mine): He ran against what he regarded as media elitism and bias, and he ran on the idea that the press disdained working-class white America. Among the many now-widening divides in the country, this is a big one, the divide between the media and working-class whites, because it creates a Wild West of information – a media ecology in which nothing can be believed except what you already believe. I simply compare this to sports reporting. It's some kind of tribalism, reinforced with each cycle, to log in and check the scores. We want to see that our team is doing well. I instinctively doubt reports that my favorite players are using PEDs, even though I tend to believe reports our rivals are. Are you ever going to convince someone not to root for their team? For a long time, political reporting seemed different - more policy details, less about the horserace. It was ok to disagree with some aspects of the platform, or to learn something new in a discussion and change your thinking. But that might have been an aberration, and what we have now is the natural state. posted by borborygmi at 11:02 PM on November 14 [4 favorites] It's not like we're immune here, especially when the comments start flying fast.

An echo chamber isn't necessarily wrong in its specific groupthink. Some such places must be very right, indeed, as a matter of probability. But when challenges to that consensus, whatever it is, become unwelcome or overwhelmed, then the situation becomes unhealthy for everyone, and a kind of oblivious brain-rot sets in. You can only agree and be-agreed-with so much before you lose track of the wider world.

Individuals can write what they want, but if you group together to promote, analyze, or report on world events and want to publish that information, then meet some basic ethical standards or be denied accreditation and the ability to put out that information under any banner beyond that of the individual who wrote it.

Did anyone, anywhere – and I am genuinely interested, because I didn't see it apart from myself here on MeFi – bring up France? You know, the major ally with a long history in the Middle East (not a happy one, but a long one) telling us "do not go to war in Iraq, you will cause a chain of events you cannot predict and that will not be good?" You know, the major ally who helped us win our revolution and wrote the Declaration of Human Rights? That ally? The one pretty much every American either ridiculed or ignored or just shrugged and said "well whatever happens, happens"? You know, Freedom Fries? Cheese-eating surrender monkeys? That ally? The nuclear power with anti-terrorism experts based in their own home countries who were giving us factual information in a desperate bid to get us to avoid an endless war? And you think this happened recently and is the fault of fucking Facebook? If people want to believe something, and ESPECIALLY if they get to play beat-the-dead-horse with their favorite stereotypes ("wheee! cheese-eating surrender monkeys! it's factual too lololol"), well, fuck, they do it. I mean look, people here know we France members and there are still those who don't take us seriously when we post about France (we won't EVEN talk about Charlie Hebdo, DO NOT EVEN). But people will post unattributed drivel if it says "France is stupid and dumb and surrendered in almost every war LOL also they are racist LOL but they make good baguettes and French women are skinny." Thanks for conveniently forgetting that French people who aren't white exist. Symptom. Not a cause. You want the cause, we have to take an uncomfortable look at ourselves and our human weaknesses.

We discussed media and our teacher talked about information gatekeepers. We were outraged: he meant to tell us that people out there decided for us what news we should hear about and what our opinion should be? My teacher waited for us to calm down: "Without gatekeepers, you'd be flooded with stories and no way to tell if they were true or even relevant to you. You would hear about a new shoe shop in a remote region in China and cute cats in Argentina, and somewhere in between all these stories there'd be a warning about poisonous air in our backyard. You need gatekeepers." These days I wonder if my teacher was a time traveller. posted by kariebookish at 4:27 AM on November 15 [20 favorites] I'm starting to think we need something like a licensing board and the equivalent of a bar exam for any organization that claims to be promoting news.

Shame was definitely in their arsenal, and misogynistic imagery was definitely used. (gossiping crone, old washer-woman, et al). Honestly, I don't remember exactly how they did it, but the experience leaves me believing that there was some effective, old-school framework out there for teaching little ones how to deal with the reception and spread of misinformation.

Or forceful slogans that combine emotive power with a strategic absence of content? If we aspire to educate policymakers of the future, are these not the skills demanded by our age? For £9k a year, might the subtle art of articulating effectual nonsense be preferable to the ineffectual tools of argumentation? For any academic this should be, of course, no less than a vision of hell. But with 2016 and its strangest of political events, such visions might drift across our consciousness. The alternative vision is a world in which a renewed sense of cause-and-effect asserts itself. That is, a situation in which it is realised that ignoring peer-reviewed expertise, evidence, and critical arguments does have consequences. Getting just anyone to fix your plumbing leads to leaks. Ignoring experts in international relations leads to wars. DIY dentistry leads to painful tooth-loss. Dismissing the predictions of climate scientists increases the potential for disaster.

All this made me think of is a couple of convos I've had or witnessed over the past couple of days. One person was for the most part arguing logically, using citations, posting links etc to back up what they were saying. The problem wasn't the lack of logic but that there is enough bullshit out there to back up what they were saying. So you end up having what on the surface matches the pattern of 'logical' argument but with one side using information from Infowars or Briebart as a citations. If someone is discussing climate change and argue climate change is hoax and BS articles articles exist like the one I saw today-- 'Over 30,000 scientists are now claiming that it is made made hoax' then they're there to support their arguments. This person is having a 'logical' argument in their mind. And no amount of saying it's bad source seem to matter. There's a whole eco-system of bullshit out there that provides support for logical arguing. It's a huge problem and I don't have any idea about what to do about it. The only thing you can do is repeat over and over 'not a good source', 'not a good source' or something similar. posted by Jalliah at 7:04 AM on November 15 [8 favorites] This is a really complicated problem, but I think part of it lies in the decline of newspapers and journalism, and in the way "new media" is incentivised.

The Oxford Don[? I don't want to leave this window to check but I think that's what he was] complaining that scholarly standards and citations aren't getting through to people? and that his time would be better spent teaching students to produce soundbites? blew my mind in particular. What kind of bubble has this guy been living in? Has he ever actually met anyone, in his entire life, outside of an elite academic institution? YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS. This is the level of discourse at which the average person operates, including intelligent people. I spent enough years sharing offices with brogrammers who "liked to debate ideas" at the top of their lungs all day, every day. They honestly didn't seem to get that it's not legitimate to just make stuff up and present it as fact, in part because they seemingly didn't understand that that's what they were doing. They were *tolerant* of scholarly standards, sure; but the way they put it was: I'm just as clever as if I did have a degree, so why act like this source is better than my list of newspaper articles and webpages just because the other guy has a piece of paper and I don't? The ones with degrees wouldn't put it this way, they'd just keep insisting on their point *as if* it were factually true. And these are the people who *were* smart. They *were* insightful. Some of them introduced me to new fields of knowledge that permanently changed the way I think. But they weren't consistent. One of them wrote an impassioned article claiming "And Cited Author said X" when in reality, Cited Author had said Very Definitely Not-X. And when I pointed this out, he got upset and defensive and said that's not fair I've done more to promote the cause of Cited Author than anyone else, I've argued online for hours every day, I have followers, people listen to me, plenty of other experts are pro-X, a lot of people think Cited Author is completely dispensable to the cause of CitedAuthorism, so why are you mocking my efforts just because I'm not in an ivory tower like you? And I said, you may be a great advocate, and experts in the field may be pro-X, and Cited Author may be dispensable, but you claimed here that Cited Author SAID X, and the FACT is that Cited Author said NOT-X. And I think I got through to him, but he would have preferred I didn't. And guys like these were thinking way way above the level of Joe or Jane Average, they could easily have understood scholarly standards if they'd wanted to. They just didn't want to. If they didn't want to, why should Joe and Jane Average, who don't perceive themselves as Great Thinkers, and don't Like To Debate Ideas, want to learn scholarly standards of discourse? Of course they don't. Why should they, because not being scholars, that's actually not their job. But if it is your job, you have to accept that that's how the world works, and some of it is because people honestly don't know how to tell truth from appearances, but some of it is also because they don't care. By insisting on what they want to be true, they may be exercising the only power they have to live in the world they prefer. It's not that hard to understand, because there is nobody who *doesn't* do this! Even those of us who try harder are still doing it, just in subtler forms, because it's an inescapable fact of human nature. One way for [?Oxford Don] to deal with the shocking new world he lives in, might be to learn and teach rhetoric, which seems to be one of the most used but least taught skills of our time. Then he might have a chance of communicating more effectively without making himself feel dirty in the process. posted by tel3path at 7:59 AM on November 15 [5 favorites] I've found that following actual journalists on Twitter is the best way to get news.

Same teacher also had us bring in any family members who'd lived through important historical events, so we got an hour with a Holocaust surviving grandparent and another with my friend's dad who got out of Russia when the USSR fell. I first got on the Internet in 1993. In the last 23 years, I've seen the Internet evolve from primarily a text based interface, which encouraged long form writing, and line-by-line-dissection of long form writing, to a medium that is primarily pictorial, and increasingly video based, where close reading of long form stuff is discouraged by code and design. Postman himself declined even to look at the web in 1999, when I started reading his books, and he passed away in 2004. In 1999, I thought the Internet was part of the solution to the problem he was writing about. Today, the Internet is a bigger problem than television and the movies. And the shift towards pictorial communication is rapidly approaching levels where it's a threat to civilization. Fark and Failblog are good amusements, but even the briefest look at 4chan will show you, we're in deep shit. The thing is, the Internet isn't just the Internet. Twitter can be criticized not for how well or how badly the company polices its users, but also in a medium-is-the-message way. Twitter is a cesspool of hate because the 140 character limit makes it useless for more than playground name calling. Facebook is part of the problem not just because of Facebook's policies but because it's an interface that pushes blogging into microblogging. Compare to Livejourbal, Wordpress, or dare I say it, Metafilter, all of which are better by design. (But don't get too smug. There's room for improvement. And it's still all stuff you're looking at with a tabbed browser, and it's always tempting to tab away.) Or compare to Instapaper. I've removed Facebook and Twitter from my phone, and now when I;m out and about and being a phone zombie, I'm at least reading 1000-2000 word essays that I loaded onto the Instapaper app previously. It's made me a lot happier. But I am sad to report that I still have not regained the long form writing ability I had 15 years ago. So, Mefites, a lot of us built this here Interweb. A lot of you are the bearded Unix gurus who built the backends in the 90s. I'm only lacking the beard. We have to do something about all this. posted by ocschwar at 8:19 AM on November 15 [8 favorites] But, back in the days before the internet, people either got their preferred wrong information from their preferred newspaper (anyone who thinks the legit press doesn't misreport things is wrong) or else just pulled it out of their arse. I'm not saying that spreading identifiable pieces of misinformation isn't worse, but take away Facebook and people would just do the same thing in other forms. Also, xenophobia in Britain didn't start when we joined the EU. Astonishingly, people in Britain hated foreigners before that too. For taking their jobs, housing, &c. And they spread rumors to support their opinions, if only by word of mouth. Did you hear the one about the Pakistani family who were found wandering along the central reservation of the motorway? When they were picked up by police they could only say one word of English: "House. House." And so, just like that, the council gave them a five bedroomed house, and that's true. It is it's true. I heard that more times than I care to count, some years before the word Internet was in anyone's active vocabulary, and some years before 1992. Now I take the point that if spreading misinformation weren't useful, propagandists wouldn't bother to do it; and if word of mouth were enough, they wouldn't be automating it. I don't doubt that a lot of the stuff I'm seeing online is coming from propagandists foreign and domestic. I think now is a very good time to be suspicious of the divide-and-conquer infighting that appears to be spreading in liberal circles right now, and to be more venomous than ever: it's working, and it's very possible that the calls are not coming from inside the house. But it's all leveraging human behaviours that have been the norm for as long as I can remember, and I'm as old as my nose but a little older than my teeth. Just as xenophobia isn't a new phenomenon since globalization, wilful ignorance isn't the snake in some Garden of Eden where scholarly discourse has always held sway up to now. People have always been pig-ignorant, they just have more opportunities to flaunt it. posted by tel3path at 8:20 AM on November 15 [1 favorite] There needs to be some legal remedy for publishing falsehoods, without infringing on freedom of speech or the press.

Metafilter didn't get an inaccurate picture of the election from the media we consume; that media and Metafilter both got an inaccurate picture of the election from the polling results. I knew full well just how horrible people out there were, even if I wasn't reading their media. I just didn't know how many of them there were, which is different. I don't need to consistently read conservative media to know their general take on things. The echo chamber can potentially be a problem if it becomes an absolute, but this is a false equivalence, I think. posted by Sequence at 8:23 AM on November 15 [6 favorites] I have come to the same conclusion about misinformation that I have about racism: That I don't care what people's intentions are. It is just as impossible for me to tell a minsinformed right winger from a liar as it is for me to tell a racist from someone who is being ironically racist, or is just ignorant. Because in the end it doesn't matter -- the results are the same. And with misinformation, the behavior is the same. Someone will make a false claim on Facebook -- for example, that the Muslim Brotherhood has a plan to overthrow the US government, or that Obama is a secret Muslim, or whatever. But if you link to sites that demonstrate that these are not facts, the person will become abusive, say the other side does it too, change the goalposts, the whole range of dissembling, dishonest behavior that liars engage in. So I just proceed from the assumption that these people are liars, and are lying for propagandist purposes, because they do not share the liberal notion that we can have different opinions but not different facts. And I think comparison to MetaFilter was unfair. We weren't in a bubble created by liars. We were working with the best information we had, which has shown to be credible in the past. We tend to be pretty good at sussing out falsehoods and we stop repeating them when they are shown to be false. And we were largely correct: Not only did Clinton win the popular vote, but did so by a number of voters that is well on its way toward being more than any male candidate has ever gotten, but for Obama. I am not sure how to deal with liars, except to fact check them an not engage them further. But their bubble is one of deliberate lies, which may be why they went with the world's biggest liar as their candidate. And I think they know he is a liar, and do not care, because they are liars too, and don't mind lies that are in service of their ideology. posted by maxsparber at 8:32 AM on November 15 [6 favorites] And the shift towards pictorial communication is rapidly approaching levels where it's a threat to civilization. Yes. And part of watching that evolution in communication modes is a realisation that the (formerly?) text-based and reading-based nature of the web was simply an accident of limited bandwidth. Images, live video, and other, more augmented forms of "live-ness" are the future of web communication, and that's a future in which reading and text have themselves become essentially deprecated by the falling cost of bandwidth. Which leads me to ask further: are literate cultures themselves simply accidents of a low bandwidth world?

Problem solved." Wrong. This is equivalent to trying to stop global climate change by encouraging people to take shorter showers. We need more systems thinking, leading to bigger solutions than individuals can effect. We're trained not to think this way in the US, to think that government is ineffective, and that therefore all large, system level actions are as well. But it's simply not true; otherwise big corporations wouldn't exist and wouldn't have the power that they do. posted by kaibutsu at 9:13 AM on November 15 "But if you link to sites that demonstrate that these are not facts, the person will become abusive, say the other side does it too, change the goalposts, the whole range of dissembling, dishonest behavior that liars engage in." Two big factors here. First is defensiveness (white fragility), brought on because almost everyone knows racism is bad, and getting called out on racism is therefore really hard for people. It's much easier to deflect and defend than to accept the criticism. Second, this is going to be exacerbated if the conversation is on a public Facebook wall. My own plan going forward is to talk on the side with people, and relate my own personal experience with being called on racist statements. Pointing out the racist statement is only the first and smallest step of helping to change minds. As SURJ puts out, we need to call people in, not out. posted by kaibutsu at 9:19 AM on November 15 The CRAP and other frameworks are kind of helpful, but I think there is something more central to bad vs good news that we should be able to pick up on and help other people pick up on if we can put our finger on it. It's hard to distinguish sources making good-faith efforts to analyze and present coherent ideas from those that are cynically manipulating their audience. And of course, even those sources generally making a good-faith effort are not perfect, and they make intentional or unintentional mistakes sometimes that manipulative sources eagerly point out makes them all just as bad. A good-faith journalistic effort isn't something we necessarily look for, and it doesn't always easily fit into the CRAP or other frameworks mentioned above. But I think it's a useful concept to frame the discussion. Just look at the Buzzfeed article and the response from Right Wing News: 1. The RWN response makes lots of threats and just generally shows a lot of anger. 2. I checked up on its claim that the Clinton Foundation barely made any charitable donations, which the RWN article cites as an example of news they 'reported' that is actually true. Well, turns out it IS factually true but it's a completely misleading fact (because as a charity they actually do things with their money). Of course it's not like RWN asked the Clinton Foundation for a response. 3. CharityNavigator.org now has hundreds of comments on the Clinton Foundation page of people who are very mad a So maybe here are some things to look out for: Does the author: - have an obvious 'enemy' or presume ill intent on the part of another? - consider alternative viewpoints or explanations? - actually tell the truth and use sources that seem reputable (but then again, what does that even mean in this day and age, other than being reasonably well informed and making a good faith effort) - (what else?) posted by ropeladder at 9:20 AM on November 15 [1 favorite] But, back in the days before the internet, people either got their preferred wrong information from their preferred newspaper (anyone who thinks the legit press doesn't misreport things is wrong) or else just pulled it out of their arse. but also, back in the days before the internet, people were forced to share their preferred wrong information verbally, or by posting clippings to each other. And the act of cutting something out of the paper, stuffing it in an envelope, finding a stamp, and sending it to your niece in college was often too insurmountable for some and they didn't bother. But now you can just click a couple buttons and it's on her Facebook wall.

I know someone whose only real source of information is the mainstream press (I mean, in theory they could go to a library and start requesting books and studying up, but they're not going to) so of course what they read there seems like fact to them. They don't have anything else. And actually, even some racists are not completely closed minded and may be acting in part out of genuine error; it can be possible to get through to them, at least for a moment. Here's an example by anecdote - I'm going to focus on an anecdote that doesn't contain racism so it's easier to stomach. Someone was really weirded out and perturbed by the way her teenage nephew spent his time. From her point of view, he was locking himself away for hours in his room playing a computer game, and talking to the computer, and the computer was talking back. She found that utterly disturbing and freakish. I mean, given that that's what she thought was going on, I don't blame her. She thought he should get out and socialize. I explained to her that it wasn't the computer talking to her nephew, it was other players, who were all real people. The way you play these games is, you turn yourself into a cartoon in the game, and you interact with all these other people who are also representing themselves as cartoons. So the voices talking back to him are all other people who are just as real as he is. So all the time he's playing this game, he *is* socializing. I get why you're concerned that he should be socializing in person with people his own age, but teenagers can be a bit menacing with the peer pressure - you know how kids try to force each other to drink, or maybe they make fun of his appearance and stuff. The other players in the game can't force him to do anything, because they're not in the room with him. Maybe playing this game lets him make friends without getting in over his head. There were a few other points of discussion that came up during the brief time we were thrown together, and I had a few openings to politely question her assumptions. Was she misinformed? Yes, in many ways. Was she a racist? Yes, that was pretty clear. Is it likely that I changed that? I doubt it, especially since she was actually kind of mean-spirited in general. But at least when I brought up something she hadn't thought of, she was open enough to go "huh! I never thought of that!"

By Jungah Lee and Hooyeon Kim / Bloomberg News Samsung Electronics is spending $8 billion to buy its way into a burgeoning market for automotive technology alongside Apple and Google as the smartphone business wanes. The South Korean company is making its largest-ever overseas acquisition with an offer for Harman International Industries, angling to become the go-to supplier of everything from in-car entertainment to connected-auto services. It comes days after Samsung Group heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee formally ascended to the board of the electronics firm, a move that may shore up his influence over the family-run conglomerate’s prized asset. Adding U.S.-based Harman will lift Samsung into the top ranks of auto technology suppliers and give it existing relationships with BMW, Volkswagen and General Motors. While Harman became a legendary name in high-end audio equipment, it’s pushed deeper into automotive supplies and now gets 65 percent of sales from the sector. With the deal, Samsung hope to marry its fast microprocessor and software technology with Harman’s infotainment and vehicle systems to offer carmakers more advanced connectivity, said Young Sohn, Samsung’s president and chief strategy officer, in a phone interview. “This is not about cost synergies,” Mr. Sohn said. “It’s about taking advantage of what Harman has built. The car will be transformed by connected technology.” The deal is the first since Mr. Lee joined the board and shows that his management style is different from his father’s, said Park Kang-ho, an analyst with Daishin Securities. “He is an aggressive deal maker,” the analyst said. “In the longer term, Samsung is thinking that life after smartphones is electric vehicles.” The Korean company joins a growing list of global technology companies moving into automobiles. The companies see cars as an industry that hasn’t yet been remade by software and online technologies. Outside of Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors, the efforts haven’t yet reached customers. Google has for years been working on self-driving software but still doesn’t have a product on the market. Apple went on a hiring spree to add staff to build its own car before recently re-calibrating the initiative to focus more on software, leading to job cuts. Uber Technologies joined the fray over the past year, hiring engineers and making acquisitions to build its own autonomous car technology. Samsung itself has bought a stake in Chinese electric-car maker BYD and at one point considered an offer for sections of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’s parts unit, a deal said to have broken down just weeks ago. With the Harman purchase, it’s taking a different approach that’s more in keeping with its history has a component maker. Rather than designing a car or building a self-driving system, Harman’s technology focuses on the growing number of services available as automobiles get connected to the internet — navigation, multimedia entertainment, security systems and analytics tools. Mr. Sohn reiterated the company’s focus on a conference call Monday. “Samsung will not get in the business of manufacturing cars,” Mr. Sohn said, while highlighting how the partnership will increase connectivity and introduce new Internet of Things technologies into vehicles. This transformation of the auto into a full-service mobile device adds up to a potential goldmine. Revenue from the data streams and connectivity components could become a 180 billion-euro ($200 billion) market by 2020, McKinsey & Co. estimates. “Samsung may have figured that it can’t become the biggest player in the car component business by itself, so it needs a big brand to get into the market,” said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. For Samsung, establishing a foothold in automotive technology offers the company a chance to shed its reliance on a smartphone market undergoing its worst downturn on record. The company is the world’s biggest supplier of displays and memory for mobile devices — replicating that dominance in autos will inject new life into the business. It’s now struggling to put the embarrassing death of the fire-prone Note 7 behind it, while searching for its next leg of growth. Samsung said Harman is the market leader in connected car solutions, with more than 30 million vehicles equipped with its connected car and audio systems and telematics. Telematic devices allow in-vehicle access to specific services, including car parks and anti-theft security. The Stamford, Conn.-based company has an order backlog for the auto market of $24 billion as of June 30. “Harman has a scale and premium in the car-infotainment and audio businesses, so it would definitely help Samsung move faster. But it alone is not enough for Samsung to become the leader in this space,” said Mr. Roh. The audio company can trace its roots back to the 1950s, when Sidney Harman teamed with Bernard Kardon to make high-fidelity audio equipment. The company would later acquire brands including JBL and Infinity, among other audio equipment makers, and become a leader in high-end car stereo systems. It also owns the Bang & Olufsen brand for cars after acquiring the business last year. Evercore is serving as financial adviser to Samsung, while JPMorgan and Lazard are advising Harman, according to the statement. Shares of Samsung fell 2.8 percent to 1,553,000 won at the close in Seoul before the announcement was made. “Harman perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,” vice chairman Kwon Oh-hyun said in the statement. “Harman immediately establishes a strong foundation for Samsung to grow our automotive platform.” Elon Musk - Sidney Harman - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd - Apple Inc - Harman International Industries Inc - General Motors Co - HMC Investment Securities - New York City - New York - United States - North America Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

Buzzfeed News is reporting that "more than dozens" of Facebook employees have created an unofficial task force dedicated to addressing the issue. Buzzfeed quoted one member of that task force, who did not want to be named over fears for their job. “[Mark Zuckerberg] knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” the source said. Facebook has not responded to the BBC’s request for comment on Buzzfeed’s report. Meanwhile, Google on Monday announced it would do more to prevent fake news sites from making money through advertising. Shortly after, Facebook made explicit a similar restriction on the use of its ad network. Read more: How can Facebook fix its fake news? The rise and rise of fake news Trump's 'hidden' Facebook army Zuckerberg promises fake news action Agitated Zuckerberg Earlier on Monday Facebook denied claims that a tool to whittle out fake news had been created before the election, only to be shelved due to concerns it would make Facebook look like it was censoring conservative views. Mr Zuckerberg appears to be increasingly agitated by the suggestion that fake news was a serious problem on his site. On Saturday night he posted a lengthy update to his profile page defending it. Image copyright Getty Images "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” he wrote. "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics." His conclusion: "Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other." That statistic - 99% - has been the subject of much derision as it apparently refers to content of any kind being posted to Facebook. In May, Facebook came under heavy criticism after it was alleged that human editors working on the Trending Topics section of Facebook were removing stories that pushed a conservative or pro-Trump agenda. Facebook denied this was the case, but removed the human element anyway in an attempt to appear neutral. Google action Facebook is not alone in coming under fire over fake news. Google said it would be clamping down on abuses of its AdSense advertising platform. "We will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” said Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville. That announcement followed reports that Google’s top-ranking news result for the term "final election result” highlighted a story from a fake news site with inaccurate information on the vote tally. Not long after Google's announcement, Facebook said it too had added "fake news" to the types of site not allowed to use the Facebook Audience Network, a system similar to Google's Adsense but smaller in scale and limited to third-party apps. Facebook said its decision was about clarity rather than any new policy, and that no action was being taken against any service as a result.

In fact it was considered to be pretty big back then. Fast forward to today with monitors reaching up to 5K, clearly an image with a 640×480 would feel almost grainy. However upscaling images isn’t just about resizing it by hand since that means that it could end up looking very pixelated, but it seems that Google might have figured out a way to do so seamlessly through a technique that they are calling, RAISR, which stands for Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution, which helps to upscale images through machine learning. According to Google, existing methods of upscaling are fast but not particularly effective because the vivid details in the higher resolution image are lost, meaning that we end up with a blurry-looking photo. With RAISR, Google will use machine learning to identify filters that can help recreate each pixel in high resolution that brings it as close as it can to the original. This means that the end result could be an image that looks as close to the real thing as possible, but in a higher resolution. So what does Google hope to accomplish with this method? For starters restoring images taken by low-resolution cameras, as well as possibly improving on the pinch-to-zoom gestures used on mobile devices to zoom in and out of images, websites, and more.

The social network announced today that it was now adding fake news sites to the list of sources already barred from using its Facebook Audience Network ads — a list that previously included misleading, illegal, and deceptive sites. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal. “We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.” Facebook has followed Google’s lead Facebook has faced criticism for its role in the US presidential elections — specifically for spreading and perpetuating inaccurate stories dressed up as real news. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the idea fake news on the platform influenced the election is “crazy,” but a number of Facebook employees apparently think differently, with some reportedly organizing a secret “task force” to solve the problem of deliberately misleading stories proliferating on the social network. By restricting Facebook’s ads, Zuckerberg’s company is at least doing something to combat the issue now, but the move won’t solve the problem outright. Fake stories with inflammatory headlines will still be capable of scoring millions of views, making it financially viable for people to invent news — such as the Pope’s apparent support of Donald Trump — that is patently false.

Picture: JAMES OATWAY/SUNDAY TIMES Human beings are labouring under the illusion that in order to succeed we need to be burnt out and stressed, says Arianna Huffington, founder of The Huffington Post. "Multi-tasking is a myth and one of the most stressful myths we believe in. Multi-tasking is really task switching," Huffington said, speaking at the Discovery Leadership Summit. Huffington — who in 2008 fainted from exhaustion, broke her cheekbone and went on to write a book called The Sleep Revolution — said people were addicted to their devices, which had deepened the crisis of burnout. "The science is clear: human beings need time to recharge. We take better care of our smartphones than ourselves. I bet you all know how much battery you have left on your smartphone." This culture was captured in the Google algorithm, Huffington said: she had Googled ‘Why am I’, and Google had autocompleted it, ‘Why am I so tired?’. Depriving ourselves of sleep led to memory loss and Alzheimer’s later on in life, Huffington said. "If you can survive on four to five hours of sleep a night you are the 1% with a genetic mutation. Congratulations. The rest of us need seven to nine hours of sleep," she said. "We are all addicted to a false way of living, addicted especially to our technology. We are drowning in data and starved for wisdom; that is affecting modern leadership." Vital skills We needed to take small steps to wean ourselves from the technology addiction, Huffington said. "Identify a time at the end of the day when you turn off your devices and gently escort them out of your room." At the start of each day, Huffington takes some time to decide what matters for that day rather than immediately rushing to her device and "doing what the world demands" of her. "Silence the obnoxious roommate; that voice in your head of doubt and anxiety. This stops us from being fully present and experiencing the wonder, the mystery and magic of life," she said. She identified the "two most essential skills in the new world order" as creativity and empathy. Machines could not reproduce these and companies should not view them as "soft benefits", she said. "Companies that prioritise the wellbeing of employees have a huge competitive advantage," she said. "We need to build new customs and habits to live our lives with more creativity, productivity, more gratitude, more joy and more sleep. Sleep is essential to resilience." Huffington has recently founded Thrive Global, a corporate and consumer wellbeing productivity platform. © Business Day Please login or register to comment.

Most Popular Apple is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn't ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Related Stories Your Questions Answered: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and 360 Video VR and AR: What Are the Real-World Marketing Implications? Apple Revenue, iPhone Sales Continue to Fall Google Goes After Apple, Amazon With New Pixel Phone, Smart Home Device Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple's revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go. While AR adds images and other digital information to people's view of the real world, virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. The glasses may be Apple's first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Mr. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft's Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio and Flyby Media, followed in 2015 and 2016. "AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this," Mr. Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. "We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity." Apple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Mr. Cook suggested in October. "I can't imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you're sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now," he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. Apple's challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google's attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. After that disappointment, technology companies largely turned their immediate focus to VR and away from AR. Google recently introduced a VR headset alongside its Pixel smartphone, and Facebook's Oculus VR unit has teamed up with Samsung on a similar headset. Microsoft has the most public AR offering. Its HoloLens product shows holographic images in a user's field of vision. Apple's effort may be more difficult because the chips, batteries and other components that will be available in a year or two may still not be small enough and powerful enough to build slim glasses capable of handling compelling AR experiences. However, given time, technical challenges may play to Apple's strengths. The company specializes in turning technology that others have struggled with into easy-to-use devices for the masses. For example, Apple simplified fingerprint technology into an unlocking mechanism for the iPhone and took touch screens mainstream with the original iPhone. Augmented reality "is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it," Mr. Cook said last month. "Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today." -- Bloomberg News In this article: Consumer Electronics Digital Technology VR Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Everyone thinks that Google built its new phones on its own, but it actually had help from HTC. However, customers won’t see any HTC branding on the new Pixel phones, and this is exactly the reason why Huawei passed up the chance to build it for Google. The Nexus 6P, which was built by Huawei in collaboration with Google, saw a lot of success in 2015. The Nexus 6P gained a lot of praise and everyone believed that Huawei would surely be responsible for building the new Nexus device for 2016. That never happened and Nexus fans got the Pixel and Pixel XL which are built by HTC. The main reason why Huawei didn’t want to build the Pixel phones is because how Google wanted to market the devices. The Pixel and Pixel XL are being sold as phones made by Google with the manufacturer’s branding, HTC, nowhere to be found anywhere on the devices. Related Stories Huawei To Release A 6-Inch Smartphone Before The Year Ends Specs Comparison For Huawei Mate 9 And iPhone 7 Huawei wanted to strengthen its brand presence in the United States and not simply  be seen as a contract phone maker, Huawei’s vice president of Consumer Business Group Colin Giles confirmed to the German site WinFuture. If Huawei decided to make the Pixel phones, most consumers wouldn’t even know that the Chinese phone maker had anything to do with the device. The Nexus 6P would have been Huawei and Google’s first step in a multi-year smartphone deal, but the Pixel and Pixel XL ended that partnership between the two. However, Google and Huawei are still working on something together, but it's not a smartphone. Huawei is currently rumored to be working on a new 7-inch tablet for Google. The tablet is said to come with a next-generation operating system based on Android called Andromeda, according to Android Police. Since Google is concentrating on its own product portfolio (Pixel, Home, etc.), the 7-inch Huawei tablet could still be far from being announced.

Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Ubisoft’s second attempt at an open world hack-em-up gets so much right, making us completely forget about the first game, and breathing new life into the genre. Moving to San Francisco and starting afresh is the smartest thing Watch Dogs 2 could have done. Unlike dreary Chicago and bland antagonist Aiden Pearce, Marcus Holloway’s San Francisco feels vibrant and alive: this is a city full of life that reacts to you as you play. Take the emote system, for example. After around fifteen hours or so it occurred to me that I hadn’t even tried it out. So I walked into a cafe and observed the citizens for a bit, before randomly flipping off an innocent woman having her Caramel Latte. Instantly, she stood up and started angrily gesticulating, which only made me do it again. She started swearing at me, and physically pushed me out of the shop. These incidental moments may not make the city feel quite as teeming with life as GTA V, but they make Mafia 3 look like a still image. I drove to a park and tried it again. This time a random jogger was the recipient of my abuse. Instantly he squared up to me, wanting to fight. A passer by saw me abusing him and started pushing me. I pulled a gun on them (a stun gun; I’m not a monster) and they backed off, and ran away, ringing the police as they went. A quick hack later and their phones weren’t working, and I’d gotten away with it. It felt alien to me to be so nasty: DEDSEC might be a group of hackers, but the gang itself is made up of likeable, almost real people. Marcus is a geek who knows how to hack, how to fight, and how to drink. The geek cliche is shed early on as he meets up with his newfound group on the beach, drinking. He awakes in his pants with a random lady. Geeks don’t meet girls, right? Marcus is a real person, and so are his pals. Much of the plot feels like a knowing nod and a wink to real world events of the past few years, as well as must-watch Amazon hacker drama Mr Robot. An early mission sees you hack into a pharmaceutical giant’s home, because he’s trying to pay a beloved artist to sell him his new album exclusively. It’s a direct reference to what happened between Martin Shkreli and the Wu-Tang Clan, and it’s not the only real world reference. A politician trying to get elected with billboards that directly resemble those of the “Make Donald Drumpf Again” Drumpf ones? Check. Incidental dialogue as you drive about who would win between Alien and Predator? Yep. Friendly ribbing between gang members? Sure. It all adds up to make a plot and world that feels human, and although there are a few dark moments, the overall tone is light and cheery. The plot revolves around evil corporations - Google has become Nudle, and your in-game smartphone even uses Nudle Maps. Politicians are using our data to lie to us, and to sell us to other companies. There’s a heavy amount of social commentary at times, but it feels odd that it’s within such an expensive game made by… well, a huge corporation. Some of it feels directly aimed at gamers and critics, with snarky comments about reviewers, and Marcus himself mentioning how it’s nice to meet a fellow hacker who’s black. This is a remarkably inclusive game, and while it’s a shame that in this day and age it even needs mentioning, it’s nice to say “well done” to Ubisoft on this one. Hacking everything is the name of the game, of course, and it’s terrific fun. An instant tap of L1 (on PS4) will automatically activate the most commonly used hack on whatever you are targeting, while a long press will let you pick from four hacking options. Driving along and hitting L1 to make a car screech out of the way and careen into a wall never gets old, nor does it stop making you chuckle each time. It shouldn’t work, but being able to actually move traffic in an open world game is just ridiculously good. A lot of the abilities are unlocked through a skill tree, which lets you spec your character out and play the way you want. It was around ten hours before I even touched the marksmanship skill tree, relying almost solely on gadgets, hacking, stealth, and upgrading my botnet hacking capacity so I could hack more without needing to grab a recharge from passers-by. The toys are so much fun, too. Flying around in your drone, using the “hacknet” (basically detective vision from the Batman: Arkham series) to tag every enemy, stealing their passwords to allow entry to buildings, it’s so rewarding. It’s also terrific to switch to your RC-car, the “jumper”, which can sneak through vents and hack panels which unlock doors. All of this, combined with the ability to hack everything, means the levels themselves are reminiscent of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, in that they feel dynamic. Meticulous planning from the outset can make a mission go smoothly, but should it all go wrong, your skills mean you have the tools to react to any outcome. But it wouldn’t work if the levels and missions were boring, and thankfully Watch Dogs 2 has a decent amount of variety, with some areas which surprise in their depth. I don’t want to spoil anything, but I lost track of the amount of times I started a mission in a building and it went places I didn’t expect. The deeper you burrow into these secure locations, the harder it is to get back out - especially if you are playing in a non lethal way. Of course, you can go in guns blazing too, and there’s no penalty for doing so. Shooting up Nudle Maps (which, yes, is full of primary colours as you’d expect from a Google Maps parody) and seeing the hipsters going crazy is ridiculous in itself, but it’s a valid way to play and there are weapons that suit it. As you’d expect from an open world game, there are some driving missions, and it’s only these that I found a little overly familiar. They’re mostly standard fare, with police chases and escapes cropping up about three times - and it’s as irritating here as it is everywhere else. Thankfully you can gain a hack which turns helicopters away, which is at least something. Elsewhere, some of the checkpointing is a little harsh. The mission areas aren’t enormous, it’s more the population of guards and locked access which makes it take time. Painstakingly scouting an area with all your tools and then being caught near the objective is bad enough, but when you realise the checkpoint wasn’t the first objective of two, but outside the building at the start, well, that’s tough. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it’s a little frustrating. This is a world full of side-quests that are addictive and distracting. Hidden research points which require Assassin’s Creed style hacking glyph puzzle games on the side of the buildings to unlock access range from easy to fiendishly difficult. Using an enormous crane to pick Marcus up from the street and scale the tallest buildings all for a paint job pickup for your weapons is great fun. Hell, you can even hack forklift trucks and picking up cars so you can climb to out of reach spots, take selfies at landmarks, or just ferry random people around as if you’re an Uber driver. It genuinely feels amazing to just walk around with the power in Marcus’ pocket. You can identify people and what they’re about, and if they are criminals, you can just wire their money to your account. You can unlock skills which allow you to place a fake warrant on someone, or even just make them out to be a gang traitor, and watch as the police or gangs do your work for them. Calling the police on someone has consequences, though, and I watched in horror as a man I’d framed was gunned down for resisting arrest. Somehow, over the 20 or so hours the story takes to finish, it never gets old. The hacking keeps the world and missions feeling fresh, and I even went right back after finishing it for more. The co-op is where Watch Dogs 2 really shines. The whole of San Francisco is a seamless multiplayer world. Random hacking events with competitors can take place at any given moment, creating fun distractions that require you to either sneakily hack an opponent, or find the person hacking you. As in the single player portions, every mission completed gives you followers, and these have milestones which grant you research points that, in turn, unlock parts of the skill tree. I can’t recall a single moment in gaming that has made me feel as elated as when a fellow critic and I took on a heist style mission, stealing some VR gear from a rival gang. After all, DEDSEC are gamers. He identified the truck with the hardware in, while I snuck round the back of the compound. I hacked the gates open and remote controlled the truck right out of the back door, before closing the gates and remote controlling a cherry picker truck to block them. They didn’t even know we were there. Or at least that’s how it should have gone. Sadly, the co-op mode currently seems very buggy. We attempted for two hours to complete multiple missions, but every single time the final part of the objective was bugged, and we couldn’t complete them. We played some over and over, hoping it would stop doing this, to no avail. I had this happen with random people I teamed up with, too. Worse yet, there appears to currently be a huge problem with the frame rate. Ubisoft has now turned off the seamless multiplayer (at time of writing), because with it on, after an hour or so of play, the game would gradually break. Initially screen tearing would occur, but then, the frame rate would slowly start to break down, to the point the game was running at a frame rate lower than I’ve seen anywhere this generation. The only way to fix the issue was to quit the game and load back in. It’s a terrible shame because there’s so much good about the multiplayer, that it being affected this way is devastating. It’s a lovely looking game, as well, mostly thanks to the location, but walking around in the early evening as rain comes it looks beautiful, as do the vibrant beaches and clean and shiny official buildings you get to explore. Watch Dogs 2 completely washes away the bad taste of the first game. The characters are likeable and fun, and it’s a world full of brilliant distractions that you can’t stop yourself from taking part in. Although the plot does wrap up a little quickly towards the end, and the main villain flatters to deceive a little too much, the hacking makes you feel like a complete badass, and the only negatives are minor. Fingers crossed Ubisoft can get a patch out ASAP and sort out the performance issues - you can work around them right now, but it would be better if they were resolved with an update.

View Comments Screen Australia and Google have today announced the four recipients of this year's Skip Ahead Initiative, a partnership which aims to find fresh Australian YouTube talent and give 'em the funding and resources to create longer, more "narratively ambitious" content. It's a good initiative for Screen Australia – especially given that Australian filmmaker talent can often best be found online nowadays. Videos made under the initiative have come from such luminaries as Aunty Donna and Mighty Car Mods, so they've got that goin' for 'em. Who are this year's winners – and what kinda stuff have they produced in the past? First off the ranks are the lads from RackaRacka, who will be creating "a livestream vlog from wannabe filmmakers on a rampage in a haunted, abandoned theatre". They are insanely popular on YouTube, and their videos are often gruesome as hell, if thats your thing. Superwog, who you no doubt know, is also up for a chunk of the funding, with the intention of creating a half-hour comedy called The Superwog Show. Food channel Charli's Crafty Kitchen – a very popular channel dedicated to cooking and craft for kids, are creating an animated called Crafty Kingdom. And lastly, the team behind BrainCraft are working on a science doco called Mutant Menu, which will cover genetic mutations in human beings. BrainCraft generally do short, fun science education vids. Mike Cowap, Investment Manager at Screen Australia, said:  Skip Ahead has grown year on year, and we’re thrilled to continue to partner with YouTube who are such a powerful force in online video and the advancement of technology and storytelling generally. These successful creators have great instincts for filmmaking and engaging with large audiences. They have earned this opportunity to make longer, more challenging narrative work, and we’re excited to see the result. We’re sure their audiences are going to love it. Source: YouTube.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube One of the problems with using online services is that usually you’ll have to sign up for a new account. This is why single sign-on options like using your Facebook or Google credentials can save you a lot of time, but what if you’d rather not link your Facebook or Google accounts with certain apps or services? Facebook did away with the need for an account for Messenger, and the good news for those who might need to use Skype every now and then is that Microsoft has announced that starting from today onwards, users will no longer need a Skype/Microsoft account to use the service. All they have to do is head on over to Skype’s website and join as a Guest. They’ll get to pick their own name and also participate in all of Skype’s features like voice and video calls. However the only downside here is that your conversations will only last for 24 hours, meaning that if you wanted to maintain a chat history you’ll have to find some way of downloading the logs manually. We suppose this might be useful for people who only need Skype for certain events, so instead of having to juggle more accounts and passwords to remember, this will let them hop in and out of the app without much fuss. Like we said, the feature is now live so head on over to Skype’s website if you’d like to take it for a spin. Filed in General. Read more about Apps, Microsoft and Skype.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Play Music relaunched with machine learning, offline playlist By Ida Torres - November 14, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Gone are the days when we would carefully create and curate our own playlists, kind of what the, ahem, oldies did with their mixtapes and what nots. Nowadays, with so much trying to claim our attention, we’d rather the music services we’re subscribed to do it for us. If what you use is Google Play Music, or if you’re planning to switch to it sometime soon, you’ll be happy to know that they’re relaunching the app, bringing you a service that will seem to know you more and also letting you listen to music offline in case you lose your connection. Since Google relies on machine learning for a lot of its apps, why not with its music streaming service? Yes, previously, it has done a pretty good job of finding out what you liked based on what you listen to, but now it even adds more information like where you are, what activity you’re doing, what time of the day it is, and even the weather at your location. It will create playlists for you based on all those things using contextual tools, like for when you’re going to the gym or just relaxing at home or going through a hectic day at the office. In case you lose connection when you’re commuting or running or hiking or wherever it is you’re going, you will still have some tunes left for you, offline. This playlist will be based on what you’ve recently listened to, and while this means you’ll probably repeat some of the tunes you were listening to earlier, at least you still have music. Well, as long as you still have some power on your smartphone left. The home screen has also been overhauled, and the playlists you will find there are all based on what it has learned about you. The update is already rolling out to users, so don’t forget to check your Google Play Music page to see if it’s ready for you.

Photograph: Patricia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images Olivia Solon in San Francisco Monday 14 November 2016 20.29 EST Last modified on Tuesday 15 November 2016 10.01 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Facebook is facing increasing pressure to improve the way it deals with fake news in the wake of the shock 2016 US presidential election result, amid reports that even some of its own staff have formed an unofficial task force to address the problem. Employees from across the company have secretly come together to try and tackle the problem, BuzzFeed reported on Monday, despite Facebook publicly playing down the role of fake news in the election. CEO Mark Zuckerberg insisted on Sunday that more than 99% of what people see on the platform is authentic, rejecting the “crazy idea” that fake news swayed voters. Facebook’s failure: did fake news and polarized politics get Trump elected? Read more “It’s not a crazy idea. What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” one Facebook employee told BuzzFeed. Privately, however, the Guardian understands that fake news is being taken very seriously and has been debated at Facebook for months. According to Gizmodo, Facebook executives have been reviewing its products to eliminate the appearance of political bias. One source said high-ranking officials were briefed on a planned news feed update that would have identified fake or hoax news stories but it disproportionately impacted rightwing news sites. The update was consequently shelved, Gizmodo claims, although Facebook denies it. The scrutiny over Facebook’s treatment of editorial content has been intensifying for months, reflecting the site’s unrivaled power and influence in distributing news alongside everything else its users share on the site. Fake or misleading news spreads like wildfire on Facebook because of confirmation bias, a quirk in human psychology that makes us more likely to accept information that conforms to our existing world views. The conspiracy theories are also amplified by a network of highly partisan media outlets with questionable editorial policies, including a website called the Denver Guardian peddling stories about Clinton murdering people and a cluster of pro-Trump sites founded by teenagers in Veles, Macedonia, motivated only by the advertising dollars they can accrue if enough people click on their links. The Pew Research Center found that 62% of Americans get all or some of their news from social media, of which Facebook accounts for the lion’s share. Yet an analysis by BuzzFeed found that 38% of posts shared on Facebook by three rightwing politics sites included “false or misleading information”, while three large leftwing pages did so 19% of the time. Earlier in 2016, Facebook faced criticism for bias against conservative news after former Facebook workers revealed that its trending news team was run by human curators who were told to routinely suppress stories on conservative topics. That followed public comments Zuckerberg made at the F8 developer conference in April 2016 criticizing “fearful voices calling for building walls” and halting immigration. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Zuckerberg said that 99% of all content on Facebook is ‘authentic’, which implies that the company knows which 1% of content isn’t. Photograph: Peter Dasilva/EPA Facebook denied the allegations and fired the trending topics team, replacing them with an algorithm that subsequently trended several fake stories – including one that labelled Fox News host Megyn Kelly a “closet liberal who actually wants Hillary to win”. According to the New York Times, this episode “paralysed Facebook’s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity”. Of course, even technology isn’t objective. The algorithms that power Facebook are embedded with biases based on a series of decisions made by humans, so claiming otherwise is disingenuous. Plus we know that Facebook can already identify truly fake news – Zuckerberg pointed this out over the weekend. He said that 99% of all content on the social network is “authentic”, which implies that the company knows which 1% of content isn’t. The problem is not unique to Facebook. If you are to believe the top Google result for “final election results”, you’d think that Trump won the popular vote in the 2016 election. He did not. The slip-up was widely reported on Monday, demonstrating that though Google’s algorithms are also susceptible to fake news, the company wants to be seen as better at tackling it than Facebook. “The goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,” a spokeswoman said. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.” Google has since revealed it is also working on a policy update to restrict its ads from being placed on fake news sites, subtly highlighting its ability to discern misleading news. “We will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters. Part of the reason Google is better at tackling fake news than Facebook is that it lacks a popular social network (its own Google Plus service lags an order of magnitude behind Facebook) where stories get shared among users and where misinformation can spread like wildfire. It’s also because Google’s search engine favors webpages that are linked to by other established sites, which typically means fake news ranks lower. Furthermore, Google handpicks the publications that appear within its news aggregator Google News. Around 75,000 websites in 45 countries have been approved to appear in this list (although these include questionable alt-right media outlets like Breitbart News). Of course, it’s not always a clear distinction between “fake” or “real” news. As pointed out by former Facebook designer Bobby Goodlatte on Medium, you can fact-check stories, but it’s not always easy to filter out quasi-truths or highly editorialized takes on events – what he describes as “bullshit”.

The device will be called Zenfone AR and will be revealed at CES in January. It will follow in the footsteps of Lenovo's Phab2 Pro, the first Tango handset, which was announced in June and went on sale at the beginning of this month. Tango is all about augmented reality (AR), enabling unique use-cases thanks to motion tracking and special depth sensing cameras. A Tango device can recognize and map physical spaces, as well as track objects and project virtual effects in a real-world setting. Speaking about the upcoming Zenfone AR, Shen said it will come with "advanced performance and functionality at a competitive price". The Zenfone 4 family will apparently arrive in the second quarter of 2017, while in Q3 we should see a standalone VR headset from Asus, with built-in cameras, sensors, and controllers. Unfortunately the Asus CEO didn't share more details about any of these products. Source Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

The company is still exploring the smart glasses market, the report states, so it’s unclear when a finished product will materialize. The earliest time frame for a product reveal is 2018, yet Apple could sit on the project for much longer or change its direction as it has with its automotive ambitions. Apple is exploring both AR and VR It’s been well known for months now that Apple has been collecting AR talent and putting minds to work in secret on some type of consumer product. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly answered AR-related questions on quarterly earnings calls, saying he thinks the technology has more potential than its virtual reality counterpart and coyly hinting at Apple’s plans to enter the space. However, as of September of this year, Apple continues to hire both AR and VR experts, leaving open the possibility that it could develop products in both categories. According to Bloomberg, Apple has already had talks with potential suppliers for components like near-eye displays. It also has the expertise behind companies like PrimeSense, Metaio, and Flyby, all startups that were focused on AR software, 3D mapping, and computer vision before Apple acquired them over the course of the last three years. The goal is to develop a pair of glasses that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and overlay information on the wearer’s field of vision. Apple has acquired a number of startups specializing in AR software AR is not without its hurdles. Google Glass was a massive flop, giving AR a sour public image and showing just how far the technology needs to go before it can be worn on our face. The most capable headset available to the public right now is the developer version of Microsoft’s HoloLens, which costs $3,000. Another startup, Magic Leap, continues to work in secret on AR technology it will not discuss in detail. Meanwhile, the rest of the tech community has turned its focus to VR. Google has its Daydream platform and new View headsets, while Facebook-owned Oculus VR and Samsung are working on all manner of high-end and mobile headsets. It’s unclear where Apple will fall on the spectrum, but Cook remains bullish on AR. “There are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” he said of AR last month. - Source: Bloomberg News Next Up In Circuit Breaker Toms-branded Apple Watch bands are for when you want to look like a woke bae Aiaiai’s modular headphones can be upgraded to Bluetooth with this swappable headband Roccat's new over-ear headphones let you switch mics for mobile gaming Nokia's canceled smartwatch appears in leaked video Lyft is replacing the pink mustache with a psychedelic dash display that knows your name Some 'Enhanced' games are having frame rate issues on the PS4 Pro Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future WhatsApp opens up video calling to everyone The Walking Dead Redemption Club season 7, episode 4: Service This Article has a component height of 10.

Related Blaming the Media for Trump? Don’t Forget Facebook, Twitter and Reddit The Wall Street Journal was first to report about the policy change Monday. The change is meant to cut off money for fake news websites, which have gotten a lot of attention in the wake of last week’s presidential election. Facebook has been at the center of a wave of criticism over social networks not doing enough to combat the spread of fake news on their platforms. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to critics this weekend by claiming that more than 99 percent of the content shared on Facebook is authentic, and denying that the network could have swayed the election. However, not everyone seems to agree: A number of employees within Facebook has banded together to counter this narrative, and suggest concrete steps to the company to more effectively fight fake news, according to a BuzzFeed report. Google came under pressure Monday as well after the company’s search engine promoted an article that misrepresented the results of the presidential election. Google’s decision to change its Adsense policies as a response to the backlash could actually provide a significant blow to sites looking to capitalize on fake content playing to reader’s fears or biases.   Filed Under: Election 2016 Facebook Google Want to read more articles like this one?

Fake news stories have been a common thing — especially since Trump fever struck the nation, as reported by BuzzFeed. Such fake stories coming out of Macedonia has brought teenagers a world away as much as $3,000 per day, at least for viral stories that get plenty of hits. Another such article about President-elect Trump and Ford is making the rounds today, with fake sites co-opting news from 2015 — and pretending as if it’s recent 2016 news. As reported by CNN, an article titled “Ford shifts truck production from Mexico to Ohio” was published in August 2015. Noted within that article published last year are facts about Ford heavy duty pickup trucks that began being assembled in Avon Lake, Ohio, instead of Mexico. [Image by Paul Sancya/AP Images] However, at least two fake websites have copied the article word-for-word — but have also added the false news that the events happened “Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency” to their titles. Folks spreading the fake articles are being chided for believing that the shift from Mexico to Ohio could happen within the few days since Mr. Trump became President-elect Trump. For example, one article is titled, “BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio,” and is being shared in droves on Facebook via a donaldtrumpnews.co website. Simply plopping the phrase in Google — with quotes included — such as “Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000” would lead folks to the original CNN piece, and inform them that the fake article being spread is indeed fake. Instead, as reported by the following trend graph via Trendolizer, it shows that some people are sharing the article and giving President-elect Trump plenty of praise for the fake article. As seen below, at least one of the fake articles has gotten 25,000 likes on Facebook as of this writing. Trend graph: <noscript><iframe src="http://pro.trendolizer.com/graph.html?type=likes&amp;hash=14e4232a537a2107e5c88d3fc5abb028&amp;width=510&amp;height=280&amp;noaverage=1&amp;nomovingaverage=1&amp;nochangerate=1" width="530" height="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></noscript> Searching for the phrase “Since Donald Trump Won the Presidency” on Facebook reveals plenty of people sharing the fake article and making comments about the piece — whether they know it’s a hoax or not. The fake article on the donaldtrumpnews.co website also links to a site titled ETF, with a duplicate article spreading the fake news. The reason such a story tends to spread so fast on social media, before being roundly debunked, is due to the fervor with which folks demand it be spread. For example, Facebook user Roberto Perra‎ wrote such a comment to Donald Trump President about the fake article. “***BREAKING: God bless Donald J. Trump. He just did something so incredible that every President in US History would be jealous of him. Let’s get this man 1 Million #SHARES to thank him for his hard work. Also remember to comment ‘Thank You Mr. Trump!'” The irony of such pro-Trump enthusiasm is that many times, as reported by the New York Magazine, is that many of the fake articles are created in Macedonia by people who simply want to make money off of the Trump craziness — instead of being invested in any one political party.

As seen in the top photo above, President Barack Obama ran up the stairs at the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan.

Tiger Global, Coatue, Appaloosa also piled into tech Tudor bet on financial institutions that have since surged Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Marquee money managers including Moore Capital Management and Point72 Asset Management boosted their holdings of technology firms in the third quarter, before the U.S. presidential election spurred a selloff in the industry. Louis Bacon’s Moore Capital almost doubled its holding in Facebook Inc. to about $103 million as of Sept. 30, and took a stake in Internet giant Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, according to government filings Monday. Point72, the family office for billionaire Steve Cohen, built a $337 million stake in Alphabet Class A shares, its biggest new buy for the period, while Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management took a $221 million position in the company. Tiger also bought $568 million worth of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. shares that trade in the U.S. The S&P 500 Information Technology Index surged almost 13 percent as the money managers built their investments in the third quarter. Since then, the sector has taken a turn. Facebook shares have fallen about 10 percent and Google has dropped 6.3 percent. Trump Policies Tech stocks in the index slumped 3.1 percent after the Nov. 8 presidential election, trailing the S&P 500 Index by 4.2 percentage points, on speculation that Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies could lower future earnings. Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in U.S. equities must file a Form 13F within 45 days of the end of each quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges, as well as options and convertible debt. The filings don’t show non-U.S. traded securities, bonds, cash or wagers against stocks. Coatue Management, Philippe Laffont’s stock-focused hedge fund, took new stakes in Apple Inc. and Alibaba worth $735 million and $295 million, respectively, at the end of the quarter. The purchases made Apple the firm’s second-largest disclosed stock position behind Facebook, a position it also increased during the quarter. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management also bought a new position in Facebook, worth $190 million. Financial Stakes Not all hedge fund managers were bullish on tech during the quarter. Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund firm led by David Einhorn, cut its stake in Apple by 1.66 million shares as the stock rallied 18 percent. Worth $587 million as of Sept. 30, the firm’s position in Apple is still its largest disclosed stock holding. Lone Pine Capital built new stakes in e-commerce giants EBay Inc., Expedia Inc. and Alibaba. Still, the fund run by Stephen Mandel trimmed its bet on Amazon Inc., reduced its wager on Facebook by more than half and cut its position in Microsoft Corp. It also slashed its stake in Alphabet’s Class A shares. Financial institutions, which have surged 11 percent since the election on Trump’s promises to deregulate the industry, were a favorite for billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, who grew his exposure to the sector 8 percent. Zach Schreiber’s PointState Capital took a $340 million stake in Bank of America Corp. -- his biggest new buy. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Close share panel Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Heart disease and strokes kill around 14 million people a year worldwide It was when Vic Gundotra's father suffered serious heart problems and nearly died that the former Google executive decided to move into healthcare tech. He now runs a firm called AliveCor that has developed a heart-monitoring device causing excitement in medical circles. AliveCor's recently launched Kardia Band, which integrates with Apple's smart watch, takes an electrocardiogram (ECG) of your heart, measuring its electrical activity as it pumps away. Medical experts believe it could potentially save thousands of lives. It can spot atrial fibrillation (AF) - one of the most common forms of abnormal heart rhythm and a major cause of stroke. You place your thumb on the metal sensor in the watchband to complete an electrical circuit and it can take a reading in 30 seconds, sending the data to the watch over high-frequency audio rather than Bluetooth or wi-fi. Image copyright AliveCor Image caption AliveCor's Kardia Band version of the heart monitor links to Apple's smart watch Kardia Band can spot other problems, too, but currently only has regulatory approval for AF. If it spots anything else unusual it suggests you go and see your doctor. "The problem with atrial fibrillation is that it's asymptomatic, which means it can come and go and often isn't diagnosed," says Mr Gundotra. For example, Ron Grant, 70, told the BBC: "At the age of 55, I had a massive heart attack - flatlined - had a bypass. It was some years after that we discovered I had AF - a funny heart rhythm to put it simply - which could lead to stroke". Mr Grant now uses the smartphone compatible version of the AliveCor device to keep tabs on his ticker. "People start modifying their behaviour once they begin monitoring their own health," says Mr Gundotra. "No-one's more interested in heart health than the owner of the heart." Biggest killers Heart disease and stroke are the biggest killers in the world, accounting for about 14 million deaths a year. If technology can give us a warning that things are going wrong before it's too late, many lives could be saved. And health budgets could be applied more effectively elsewhere. In the US, around 130,000 people die a year directly or indirectly from AF, while more than 750,000 have to go to hospital, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Former Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba survived a cardiac arrest during a game And it costs about $6bn (£4.8bn) a year to treat the condition in the US. In the UK, around 100,000 people suffer sudden cardiac death each year, to which AF is a contributor. According to NHS England, AF is responsible for a third of all strokes and costs the NHS more than £2.2bn a year to treat. So it's easy to see why health authorities are interested in simple wearable devices that could significantly increase early diagnosis of such heart problems before they become life-threatening - and more costly to treat. In the summer, Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, said such innovations would be "fast-tracked" so they can be adopted within the English health system much more quickly. Clinically proven There are scores of fitness trackers on the market these days, most of them wristbands, and while they may be useful motivational tools, most of them don't yet have regulatory approval. "Fitness trackers are all very well, but doctors want clinically proven products whose data they can use to make clinical decisions," says Mr Gundotra. But going through the rigorous testing process required for a health product to receive regulatory approval can take years, so it's no wonder most consumer tech companies don't bother. Image copyright AliveCor Image caption AliveCor's smartphone compatible heart monitor, Kardia Mobile, has regulatory approval Confusingly, AliveCor's smartphone compatible sensor, Kardia Mobile, has received regulatory approval in the US and Europe, whereas the Kardia Band smart watch version is currently approved only for Europe. "We hope to get US approval soon," says Mr Gundotra. Collating and studying millions of ECGs AliveCor's sensors have taken, and applying machine learning to the data, is also promising to reap rewards - although these are early days for the research. Image copyright AliveCor Image caption The software interprets the electrical pattern your heart makes, looking for abnormalities AliveCor is collaborating with the Mayo Clinic in the US to see if other useful indicators can be discerned from the electrical pulse patterns generated by our hearts. For example, they may be able to detect whether you have too much or too little potassium in your system, a mineral that plays a key role in keeping your heart beating in a normal rhythm. Potassium also helps your nerves to function, your muscles to work, and your kidneys to filter blood. At the moment we can only find out potassium levels from a blood test, so if this information could be gleaned from a quick ECG instead, the medical benefits could be huge. Wearables that work So what other clinically proven apps and gadgets are causing a stir? Remote monitoring is a big area of research, with companies like Preventice Solutions and Biotricity offering heart monitoring kit that records and sends ECG data wirelessly to a smartphone app or to the cloud, allowing doctors to be alerted immediately of any heart abnormalities in their patients. Preventice's BodyGuardian has received approval by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), but just the software element of Biotricity's Bioflux product has so far been approved. Image copyright Dexcom Image caption Dexcom's blood sugar monitor sends data wirelessly to a smartphone "Remote monitoring could save a lot of money - hundreds of thousands of dollars a year - because people have to go into hospital much less often," says Annette Zimmermann, research director at Gartner. And Dexcom has recently had its continuous glucose monitoring system approved by the FDA, enabling people with Type 1 or 2 diabetes to measure their blood sugar levels automatically every five minutes and see the trends displayed on a smartphone. A growing number of advice apps are winning approval, too, from myCOPD, which enables patients to manage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), to BlueStar, an app helping people with Type 2 diabetes manage their condition. Fitness wearables may be more fashionable, but it's the clinically proven gadgets and apps that could end up saving the most lives.

Apple's AR smart glass can connect wirelessly to an iPhone to show notifications and also act as AR head-gear while playing games Rohit KVN   November 15, 2016 11:28 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Apple working on Snapchat’s rival smart eye-gear with AR capability; will it be launched with iPhone 8? In Picture: A woman looks at the screen of her mobile phone in front of an Apple logo outside its store in downtown Shanghai September 10, 2013.REUTERS After having reaped huge success in Apple Watch, Cupertino-based technology giant Apple has reportedly commenced work on a new smart wearable project with AR (Augmented Reality) feature. Apple has ordered limited quantities of near-eye displays from a supplier probably for development and evaluation purposes, Bloomberg reported citing people with insider knowledge. Why advertise with us? Related Apple iPhone 8 to come with drastically changed display panel Apple AirPods set to hit stores next week Also read:  Google Pixel can be hacked in under 60 seconds; should device owners be worried? The company plans to develop the smart glass that can connect wirelessly to an iPhone to show notifications and also act as AR head-gear while playing games. If launched, it will directly compete with Snapchat's glass dubbed as the Spectacles. It houses built-in camera with the ability to record 10-second videos and share them on social media sites. The news comes in the wake of stagnation of iPhone sales in developed markets of America and China. Earlier in July, Tim Cook, Apple CEO, during quarterly investors' meet had expressed interest in AR technology and possible funding of the project, after noticing the Pokemon Go's phenomenal response from public across the world. [Note: Pokemon Go is an AR game that makes use of the smartphone's camera and GPS location feature to project virtual Pokemon animals on the screen and the user have to collect these creatures by tossing a virtual Pokeball at them.] Furthermore, the year-2017 will mark Apple's 10th anniversary of the company's first iPhone. Reports have emerged that the company is leaving no stone unturned to make the iPhone 8's launch epic. With the new revelation, many believe Apple's secret smart glass project might figure in Tim Cook's keynote speech's last-announcement feature—"But there's one more thing" –made popular by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Will Apple smart glass really be the part of the "One more thing.." in iPhone 8 launch? Market analysts suggest, we should not keep our hopes up on Apple AR smart glass, just yet, because, Apple, in the past, has worked on many similar projects, but dumped them citing technical limitations and other reasons. For instance, Apple had reportedly set-up a huge team of highly qualified automobile experts to manufacture driver-less car under "Project Titan" banner. But, for reasons unknown, it has been kept under a back burner and has initiated work on automated driver software for cars. Read more: Apple puts the brakes on Project Titan car plans Even if Apple finds the smart glass worth releasing to the market, it will take its own sweet time, at least two years, to fine tune the features. So, we can expect the device to break cover only around 2018 or in the following year. It remains to be seen if Apple smart glass meets similar fate or not. Watch this space for more updates.

WhatsApp launches video calling for everyone Posted 11 hours ago by Josh Constine (@joshconstine), Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Zuora latest cloud company to launch predictive data product WhatsApp wants to be international cross-platform FaceTime. Today, the Facebook-owned chat service WhatsApp is officially launching video calling for its over 1 billion users worldwide on iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Its debut follows a series of reports from people who recently found the feature had been enabled in beta versions of WhatsApp on Android and on Windows Phone – an indication that a public debut was on the horizon. To use the new feature, WhatsApp users can hit the call button in the top right corner of a conversation, which will bring up an overlaid interstitial asking if you want to voice or video call the friend or family member you’re chatting with. To kick off the video call, you simply select the “video call” option from this screen. During the call itself, you can switch between the forward-facing and rear camera, mute the call or press the red button to hang up. It seems the user interface varies slightly on Android and iPhone in terms of where the picture-in-picture video feed is displayed, as well as the buttons’ size, lineup and placement. (See images and video below.) WhatsApp already supports a number of standard features for communications apps, including group texting and voice calling. But the company says that video calling has remained one of its top feature requests from users. video-calling-android-2 video-calling-iphone-2 video-calling-iphone video-calling-android  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit With video calling, WhatsApp is belatedly catching up with a number of rivals, including Facebook’s own Messenger app, for example, as well as Skype, Apple’s FaceTime, Viber, LINE and Google’s recently launched Duo, to name a few. Though a late entrant, WhatsApp still has a massive user base and the addition of the feature could help them from fleeing to other messaging and calling platforms. In addition, WhatsApp touts its cross-platform support as one of the reasons to use video calling in its app, instead of elsewhere. “…we want to make these features available to everyone, not just those who can afford the most expensive new phones or live in countries with the best cellular networks,” the company said in its announcement, published today. That’s a direct shot at things like FaceTime, which only works on Apple devices, as well as newer arrivals, like Google Duo, which only runs on later versions of iOS and Android (Jelly Bean and up, or iOS 9 and up). You may not immediately see video calling in WhatsApp today, however. The rollout is staged, meaning it will arrive over the days ahead as it reaches the entire WhatsApp user base. Video calling isn’t the only new addition to arrive recently. The company also rolled out two-factor authentication in some of its beta versions, hinting that its next big release could be a security-focused upgrade. By retaining its simple interface but embracing more vivid connections beyond texting, WhatsApp could flourish with users no matter how they want to communicate 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase WhatsApp Founded 2009 Overview WhatsApp Messenger is a cross-platform mobile messaging app which allows you to exchange messages without having to pay for SMS.

It has just banned fake news publishers from joining its advertising network, according to its policy on publisher conduct. Fake news joins pornography and gambling among the things that Facebook prohibits in its Facebook Audience Network. The new policy states publishers are banned from the network if they show: content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, or that promotes regulated goods, pornography, adult products or services, casual dating, violence, weapon sales, online real money games of chance or skill, work-at-home schemes, spy cameras, fake news or anything that falls within any other categories that are prohibited by the Facebook Community Standards, with the exception of apps or sites that display news editorials featuring the above content or if you have our prior written permission. The network allows publishers with their own sites or apps to show ads from 4 million Facebook advertisers. This lets publishers monetize their content, and gives Facebook a way to distribute their clients’ messages more widely. Facebook’s policy was updated on Monday (Nov. 14), according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported this news. However, the advertising ban won’t directly affect the distribution of fake news through Facebook’s News Feed, which is in the spotlight after the US election. It’s the News Feed algorithm that publishers of false anti-Hillary Clinton content—like enterprising teens in Macedonia—appear to have successfully gamed to ensure their stories go viral. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the notion that Facebook may have influenced the election as “a pretty crazy idea.” The new ban highlights an inconsistency in the tech giant’s position on fake news. Facebook has said that it lacks the ability to effectively detect “misinformation” in its News Feed and that it’s working to improve on it. Yet the advertising ban would require Facebook to filter out precisely the publishers of such content. The ban also mirrors Google’s, which said Nov. 14 that it would restrict ads from being displayed on fake news sites through its AdSense network. Facebook’s publisher guidelines say apps on its ad platform are checked by an automated process and then inspected manually. We’ve asked Facebook how it intends to identify publishers of fake news but haven’t immediately heard back. Google and Facebook may have figured out how to turn free information into massive profits. But even if information wants to be free, we all benefit when some of it is subjected to checks and balances. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

The letter sent on Monday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet’s Google, Uber and Twitter, represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign. “The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue,” reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, and seen by Reuters. Some of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump’s priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict U.S. internet companies from growing in that market. Other goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign. They include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to U.S. government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally. The association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was “softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country.” While urging support for trade agreements, the letter does not mention the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump has repeatedly assailed with claims it was poorly negotiated and would take jobs away from U.S. workers. The technology sector supported the deal, but members of Congress have conceded since the election it is not going to be enacted. Trump’s often-shifting policy proposals on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and sometimes elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda.

NEW DELHI: Two top venture capital firms, SAIF Partners and IDG Ventures India have led a Rs 27 crore round of funding in Bengaluru-based mobile social gaming startup PlaySimple Games. Proceeds from the Series A round of financing, will be used by the two year-old Bengaluru-based company to expand its team, and developing fresh content. This is the second round of investment by IDG Ventures in PlaySimple, having led a $500,000 seed round in the company in early 2015. "Gaming is a huge market internationally and a very competitive one. We have known the PlaySimple team for over a year and have been amazed by the growth they have got in a very short period of time," said Mayank Khanduja, principal at SAIF Partners. Boutique investment bank Khetal Advisors acted as the financial advisor to PlaySimple for the transaction. The Bangalore-headquartered startup had also received $50,000 after being selected to be part of Google's Launchpad accelerator in June earlier this year. "Although gaming is considered be a hit-and- miss business, PlaySimple's formula on building games and their highly data driven/analytical approach have allowed them to be successful," said Karthik Prabhakar, director and head - Fundraising at IDG Ventures India. Founded by ex-Zynga employees, Siddharth Jain, Preeti Reddy and Suraj Nalin, along with IIT Bombay alum Siddhanth Jain, PlaySimple largely caters to markets outside of India, namely US, Australia and Canada. It claims to have more than 10 million downloads for its two flagship products, GuessUp and WordTrek. "Most of the capital will be used for building our team. We currently have about 22 people, and hope to ramp up that number to about 50 by end-2017. We have openings across the board, and are looking to hire product managers and designers," Siddharth Jain told ET. According to Jain, the B2C company is targeting a top-line of $5 million-$7 million for the financial year ending March 2017, and expects to be profitable by the end of the current fiscal. For FY 2016, it earned revenue of about $3 million. The games developed and released by PlaySimple, and which are available on the Android and iOS platforms, as well as on social media platforms, such as Facebook, are free to download, but players will have to purchase virtual goods as they progress. An additional revenue stream is from the advertisements placed in the games. "We deliver close to half a billion ad impressions every month," Jain said. According to industry estimates, India's mobile gaming market is still at a nascent stage, and estimated to be at $40-$50 million, but is growing at a CAGR of 50%.

WhatsApp was one of the last major messaging services to offer voice-calling, and is now catching up with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Snap Inc. as well as Google and Apple. “We’re introducing this feature because we know that sometimes voice and text just aren’t enough,” it said in an e-mailed statement. Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $22 billion and the chat app has since focused mainly on expanding its audience, not making money. Still, WhatsApp has evolved from its roots as a bare-bones texting platform, and video-calling could increase the loyalty of its user base until Facebook works out a business plan.

Statistics from the Nigeria Inter Bank Settlement Scheme (NIBSS) indicate there are 93 million bank accounts in the country with 63.7 million of them being active. As at September 2016, operators of current accounts in the country stood at 25.4 million, with savings account having 65.4 million holders while there were 2.48 million other accounts users in the country. The Guardian learnt that the introduction of the Bank Verification Number (BVN) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in collaboration with the banks in 2015 showed that there are about 28 million unique identity accounts in the country. With cybercriminals on the prowl, The Guardian checks showed that customers of some top commercial banks in the country are currently being bombarded with suspicious phishing mails targeted at their daily Internet banking transactions. It was learnt through a cyber security expert, who preferred anonymity, that some of these attackers (fraudsters) are based in the United States, United Kingdom, UAE, Russia and South Africa among others, trying to break into accounts in Nigeria because of the open Internet gateway. A 2014 NIBSS report showed that there were 1, 461 cases of fraud in 2013 involving N7.7 billion-attempted value, but that about N6.2 billion was actually lost to e-fraud. The fraud is projected to come through several scam mails, technically called phishing, which are being received on a daily basis by customers of some of the banks. Phishing emails try to trick the user into revealing some personal information. The emails look like they are from a legitimate source, such as a bank, Google or Yahoo, but they’re not. They attempt to lure unsuspecting bank customers by asking them to open a link to either update their online banking profile or change their Personal Identification Numbers (PINs). The President of Cyber Security Experts Association of Nigeria (CSEAN), Remi Afon, who revealed that 89 per cent of breaches had a financial or espionage motive, noted that phishing accounted for 83 per cent of cybercrimes. According to him, it usually takes 146 days before a successful breach is detected, while 84 per cent of breaches are against the application layer. Some of the phishing emails, compiled by The Guardian, which were purportedly sent by a bank, through an online medium reads: “Dear customer, we got a request to reset your password and if you did not make this request, kindly follow the below link (provided in the email) to cancel the password request on your online account.” Also, the customers receiving the scam emails are told: “If you made this request, kindly follow the below link to proceed with the password request on your online account.” Another email purportedly sent by the bank reads: “Dear customer, this is a confirmation that the password for your online account has just been changed. If you didn’t request or make this password change, kindly follow the secured link https://ibank…bankplc.com/RetailBank/ for security purpose. “If you made this password change kindly follow this link to review your account information https://ibank…bankplc.com/RetailBank/.” In an email from another bank’s online platform, customers were told that a beneficiary had been added to their online account and that they should click a link if they had not authorised such a beneficiary. The scammers will thus provide a Universal Resource Locator (URL) link, which the unsuspecting customers are implored to click to go and ‘de-activate the beneficiary.’ A similar phishing email will ask bank customers to update their online banking profiles. Another scam message sent to a customer via a mobile phone, reads: “Dear customer, due to system upgrade and BVN link your ATM card has been deactivated. To activate, call customer care line on 0810…” A senior official of a bank, who preferred anonymity, told The Guardian that the bank was not the one sending such emails, but online scammers, with the intent to defraud their unsuspecting targets. She said the bank, like the other ones, would not advise the customers to change their PIN online or reveal some vital information in the cloud. The Google West Africa’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, in an interview with The Guardian, said phishing emails tried to trick people into revealing personal information. Ogunlade said through phishing, the type of information targeted from customers include the demographics and those that are personally identifiable (those that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a person or can be used with other sources to uniquely identify a single individual, including name, address, phone number, social security, birthday, birthplace, credit card information, account numbers).Others relate to behaviour (purchasing habits, websites visited, credit card transactions).

Trump has also urged a boycott of Apple Inc products over the company's refusal to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone associated with last year's San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon, and demanded that tech companies such as Apple manufacture their products in the United States. In a statement, Beckerman said the internet industry looked forward to working closely with Trump and lawmakers in Congress to "cement the internet's role as a driver of economic and social progress for future generations."

Photo: Reuters San Francisco: Apple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief executive officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it’s known, adds images and other digital information to people’s view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. The glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software start-ups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016. “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in a 26 July conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” Apple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. “I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now,” he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. Apple’s challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google’s attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. After that disappointment, technology companies largely turned their immediate focus to VR and away from AR. Google recently introduced a VR headset alongside its Pixel smartphone, and Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR unit has teamed up with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd on a similar headset. Microsoft has the most public AR offering. Its HoloLens product shows holographic images in a user’s field of vision. Apple’s effort may be more difficult because the chips, batteries and other components that will be available in a year or two may still not be small enough and powerful enough to build slim glasses capable of handling compelling AR experiences. However, given time, technical challenges may play to Apple’s strengths. The company specializes in turning technology that others have struggled with into easy-to-use devices for the masses. For example, Apple simplified fingerprint technology into an unlocking mechanism for the iPhone and took touch screens mainstream with the original iPhone. Augmented reality “is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” Cook said last month. “Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.” Bloomberg Mark GurmanAlex WebbIan King Topics: Applesmart glasseswearablesiPhonesTim Cook More from this Section Vivo to double India manufacturing capacity by next year Twitter to upgrade some features to thwart cyber-bullying Religare Enterprises to write-off Rs794 crore Gail India Q2 profit up 179% on cost savings, petrochem PNB Housing Finance Q2 profit up 78% at Rs137 crore Editor's Picks To curb conversion of black money into white, govt turns to indelible ink marks Tata Motors independent directors refuse to pick sides in Tata vs Cyrus Mistry fight Demonetization is a hollow move Reliance Jio’s entry a boost for Ericsson, Truecaller and Lava Mobiles A new economic paradigm is being fashioned First Published: Tue, Nov 15 2016. 09 01 AM IST Latest News Ensure indelible ink for cash deposit does not create problems for voters: EC to centre India to get 4 P-8I reconnaissance aircraft starting 2020 Parliament set to witness furore over demonetization drive Editor's Picks To curb conversion of black money into white, govt turns to indelible ink marks Tata Motors independent directors refuse to pick sides in Tata vs Cyrus Mistry fight Demonetization is a hollow move Latest News Ensure indelible ink for money deposit does not create problems for voters: EC to centre India to get 4 P-8I reconnaissance aircraft starting 2020 Parliament set to witness furore over demonetization drive Researchers discover genetic mutation linked to heart muscle disease NHAI invites bids for project reports for 44 freight corridors Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

It began to unravel for Bradley William Dejong, 46, in May 2015 when a representative from Google reported to authorities an instance of a suspicious picture being uploaded to an e-mail. It was traced back to Dejong who was arrested in August 2015. Among the 9,100 images of pornography found in Dejong's collection, several hundred depicted children, the court heard during a hearing before Prince George provincial court judge Shannon Keyes. He originally claimed he downloaded them inadvertently while searching for images for a different genre but Crown also noted many were found in a particular folder marked "Brad's kids." There was also evidence he used a file-deleting software to cover his tracks. He also claimed the acts were committed while he was having trouble with medication he was taking for bipolar disorder although the dates of the downloads stretched back to June 2012. However, Dejong pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and had no previous criminal record. The court was also told Dejong had since taken steps to better manage his medication. A logging truck driver, he said went off his medication because it made him drowsy. A tearful Dejong apologized to the court when given a chance to speak. "For what it's worth, I'm very remorseful," Dejong said. Over the course of the time for which investigators had determined Dejong was downloading child pornography, the mandatory minimum for the crime had increased from 45 days to one year and the law had come to realize the offence harms children, Keyes noted. Crown counsel had been seeking 15 months while defence counsel asked for one year. Conditions of his probation include that he not be in the presence of anyone under 16 years old without permission and to stay away from parks, playgrounds, pools and schools. The same conditions will also apply for a further 10 years once his probation is up. Dejong's name will also be on the national sex offender information registry for 20 years. Keyes agreed with defence counsel's request to recommend to correctional services that Dejong serve his time at Ford Mountain where he can get counseling for addiction to child pornography. © Copyright 2016 Prince George Citizen 'Please support the Prince George Citizen and online news like this by purchasing a digital subscription.'

Now Althea, a Seoul-based start-up, is trying to cash in on the trend by making inroads into southeast Asia's growing e-commerce market. Demand for South Korea-made cosmetics has seen a substantial growth in recent years due to the global appeal of its pop stars and actors, attractive pricing as well as the frequent launching of new products to keep up with consumer demands. The country's beauty exports globally in 2015 stood at $2.5 billion based on data from Korea Customs service, having seen an average of 37 percent annual growth since 2011, Sunny Um, an analyst at Euromonitor, told CNBC by phone. One of Althea's co-founders and CFO, Jae Kim, told CNBC the decision to move into the region was a "no-brainer" because of a pent-up demand for Korean beauty products that was being unmet by other companies. The startup sells more than 100 local brands on their site, from internationally recognizable names like Laneige to quirky ones such as Witch's Pouch and W.Lab. "To give you a perspective, there are about 8,000 Korean cosmetic brands in (South) Korea alone," according to Kim. Southeast Asia represents an important market for e-commerce players given a large base of young consumers and growing internet penetration. A study from Google and the Singapore government's investment arm, Temasek Holdings, predicted in May that Southeast Asia's digital economy was set to grow to $200 billion by 2025, driven by a rise in e-commerce. SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty Images "The passion and popularity of all things Korean - culture, pop culture, K-drama and Kpop - is really strong here," said Kim, a former finance professional who co-founded the company with Frank Kang and Christopher Cynn, who was behind the South Korean e-commerce site Ticketmonster. Kim explained Althea targeted southeast Asia, instead of bigger markets such as China and the U.S., because of the relative lack of competition. Memebox, for example, is another Seoul-based startup that focuses more on the two larger markets. But data suggested ignoring China and the U.S. could mean losing out on a large chunk of potential market share. China, according to Euromonitor's Um, accounted for 41 percent of the South Korean beauty export market, followed by Hong Kong, U.S., Japan and Taiwan. By contrast, exports to southeast Asia were relatively smaller, with few bright spots in Singapore and Thailand. Althea operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand; Kim did not disclose the exact number but said the company saw more than 500,000 unique visitors to their site monthly. The company has a centralized warehouse and inventory location in South Korea that ships parcels directly to customers. Kim said that approach allowed Althea to sell in any country without breaking the bank and build good relationships with the South Korean cosmetics brands in order to get better supply terms. A potential hurdle for any e-commerce operator in this region is sorting out the various means of payments - cash-based and online - that are popular in individual countries. Credit card penetration is not as widespread as other regions. To get around this, Althea last week said it teamed up with Dutch payments company Adyen to offer a wide variety of payments options to its customers. "A lot of people prefer cash-based local payment options," said Kim. show chapters <p>South Korean pop culture evolves</p> <p>J.Y. Park, artist, producer and chairman of JYP Entertainment, discusses the evolution of South Korean pop culture and how Korean pop music is breaking into the U.S.</p> South Korean pop culture evolves    Monday, 24 Oct 2016 | 6:41 PM ET | 03:00 The Amsterdam-based startup Adyen is valued at $2.3 billion and has clients such as Uber, Netflix and Spotify. It began by helping web companies such as Facebook collect payments and then moved into mobile; it released software that ran on point-of-sale terminals to help bricks-and-mortar stores. "We process payments for merchants only, we do not have a relationship with consumers...(that) relationship should be with the merchant," Warren Hayashi, Asia Pacific president of Adyen, told CNBC in an interview. Hayashi remarked low credit card penetration - Singapore being the exception - in the region meant there was an opportunity for retailers to reach out to local customers in big markets such as Indonesia through local payments methods - such as Mandiri Clickpay in Indonesia and GCash in the Philippines.

When a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck near Hanmer Springs just after midnight on Monday New Zealanders took to Google to find out more about the quake.  There was a massive spike in searches for 'Christchurch' and 'Wellington' immediately after the first quake struck. With the shake felt so widely many New Zealanders appeared to be searching to see if the Christchurch had been hit by another big one.  Iain McGregor Damaged footpath in Kaikoura. At about 2am search interest for 'earthquake' was briefly overtaken by interest in 'tsunami', as Civil Defence warnings began to issue warnings urging people in coastal areas to seek higher ground.

The letter sent on Monday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet's Google , Uber and Twitter, represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign. "The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue," reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association. Some of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump's priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict US internet companies from growing in that market. Other goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign. They include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to US government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally. The association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was "softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country." © RAW 2016 USA Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

CST November 14, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — The controversy over whether fake news on Facebook played a role in Donald Trump's election victory has apparently hit the employee ranks of the social media giant. A group of Facebook employees has formed an "unofficial task force" to meet in secret and investigate whether the spread of hoax articles on the service influenced the election's outcome, according to a report published in BuzzFeed News. Sources told BuzzFeed the task force which includes employees from across the company is taking issue with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's contention at a technology conference last week that the notion that fake news had an impact was a "pretty crazy idea." "It's not a crazy idea. What's crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season," one Facebook employee, who works in the social network’s engineering division, told BuzzFeed. Another Facebook employee said "hundreds" of Facebook employees had objected to the company's public position on fake news. The task force is probing whether Facebook dedicated sufficient resources to reports of fake news. Facebook could not be reached for comment. Google was dragged into the fake-news controversy on Monday, too, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed Trump won the popular vote in last week's election. Hillary Clinton campaign's chief digital strategist on Monday blamed Facebook for the spread of misinformation about the Democratic nominee. "Everyone has the right to say what they want, have access to sites that they want, share what they want," Teddy Goff told POLITICO. "But a publisher with a record of making stuff up is not likely to rank that highly on Google, and the equivalent ought to be the case on Facebook." Criticism of Facebook's ascendant power to sway public opinion is growing after the election. About half of adult Americans rely on Facebook as a source of news, a recent study from the Pew Research Center found. A BuzzFeed News report found that three large left-wing pages published false or misleading information in nearly 20% of posts, while the three big right-wing Facebook pages published it 38% of the time. The Facebook employees, who spoke with BuzzFeed News on the condition of anonymity, said they were not taking sides in the election, but advocating that Facebook not favor any candidate through the dissemination of fake or misleading information. Zuckerberg initially dismissed suggestions that fake stories — such as ones that stated Pope Francis had supported Trump — played  a role in the Republican presidential nominee's victory. "To think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea," Zuckerberg said Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. On Saturday, Zuckerberg said Facebook is taking steps to eliminate fake news and hoaxes. While reiterating earlier comments in which he said it was "extremely unlikely" that phony stories posted on Facebook changed the election outcome, Zuckerberg said work has already begun that would enable users "to flag fake news and hoaxes." "This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully, though," said Zuckerberg, who asserted that "more than 99% of what people see is authentic."

And now Apple may be planning a similar device. Apple is looking at introducing smart glasses that would show images and information into the wearer’s field of view, say sources speaking to Bloomberg. The device would connect wirelessly to the wearer’s iPhone and could also use augmented reality. The glasses are said to still in the early stages at Apple, with the company only ordering a small number of near-eye displays from one supplier for its internal testing. If Apple does decide to launch these glasses to the public, the release wouldn’t happen until 2018 at the earliest, says a source. Apple hasn’t made any official announcements about these digital glasses, and it’s possible that this product will be killed off and never see any kind of public reveal. Apple is a huge company, and so it makes sense that it would regularly investigate new products but ultimately decide to scrap them if it can’t build those products exactly how it wants. All that said, Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed interest in augmented reality in the past, saying things like “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this” and “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” While Google Glass ultimately failed, Apple could learn from Glass’s mistakes and use improved technology to release headwear that fares better than Google’s effort. What do you think of today’s report? Would Apple have success with its own pair of digital glasses?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The stock market’s post-election bifurcation sharpened Monday as technology shares extended their worst performance since the start of the bull market on speculation Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies will translate into lower earnings. Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. led the S&P 500 Information Technology Index down 1.7 percent for the biggest retreat since September. The group stands out as the only industry that normally benefits from a rising economy not to rally on speculation Trump’s policies will stoke domestic growth. Tech stocks in the benchmark equity gauge have slumped 3.1 percent over four days, trailing the S&P 500 Index by 4.2 percentage points, the most since May 2009. Small caps in the Russell 2000 Index surged 1.2 percent to an all-time high. No single fact explains the tech rout though everything from trade and immigration policy to industry rotation to flat-out campaign retaliation have been cited. Technology is the biggest group in the S&P 500 by far and one of the only ones to consistently post earnings growth over the last 18 months. “Technology provides the productivity gains for the global economy and many of the large-cap names like Apple and Amazon were carrying the torch for the market,” Channing Smith, a managing director at Capital Advisors Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said by phone. The firm oversees about $1.8 billion. “Without their participating, that’s definitely going to create a headwind for the market.” The S&P 500 slipped less than one point for a second day of losses, with tech giants bearing the worst of the rout. The FANG block of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet each fell more than 2.4 percent. The group has dropped every day since Trump’s victory, sinking 8 percent for the worst retreat since February amid concern about the impact of Trump’s policies on trade overseas, where U.S. technology companies thrive. The industry, which largely supported Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, may also face higher hurdles for expanding their footprints after some high-profile business leaders including Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos clashed with Trump during the election. Trump, responding to negative coverage in the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, maintained Bezos purchased the news organization to gain political influence and avoid antitrust scrutiny. Shares of the online retailer have lost more than $30 billion in value since Tuesday’s vote. “It’s a big deal with what potentially Trump could do,” said Blake Harper, an analyst that covers internet stocks at Loop Capital Markets LLC in Chicago. “If you look at investors in Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, they’re stacking some type of operationality for them to continue to expand internationally and also expand into other different categories outside their core markets,” he said. “He definitely indicated he would pursue antitrust measures against companies like Amazon. You’d have more restrictive policies to prohibit expansion.” Any slowdown in tech earnings may deal a blow to a market that just emerged from a five-quarter profit slump, the longest since the global financial crisis. While S&P 500 income rose 2.7 percent in the third quarter, profit at tech firms expanded almost 8 percent, actual results and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The decline in tech shares came after they extended their leadership at the fastest rate in four years, raising their representation in the S&P 500 by more than 1 percentage point to a 15-year high of 21.4 percent in the third quarter. From Apple to Facebook, mega techs now occupy half of the top 10 spots in ranks of the most valuable American companies, matching the number at the peak of internet mania. For now, the market seems to be holding up, with S&P 500 trading within 1.2 percent of an all-time high, as the retreat in tech stocks has been countered by rallies in financial and industrial companies, shares expected to benefit from Trump’s plans to boost fiscal spending and ease regulations. Banks climbed 2.3 percent Monday, extending their gains since Trump’s victory to 11 percent, while industrial stocks have added 5.2 percent in that time. “The market is getting ahead of itself here and selling off and being hard on tech,” said Timothy Ghriskey, who helps manage $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management LLC in New York. “Tech is where a lot of gains were, so as money gets shifted around to different sectors, meaning into financials and into health care and industrials, it has to come out of somewhere and a lot of it has come out of tech.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

Stays Tight-Lipped on Acquisition Reports Why we are disappointed on the lacking merger and acquisition commentary during Twitter's most recent earnings call. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Nov 14, 2016 at 8:21PM Months ago, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) released statements about interest in merger and acquisition activity. Yet, as of its most recent conference call, nothing has materialized and CEO Jack Dorsey remains mum on the issue. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Dylan Lewis and Daniel Sparks explain what Twitter's lack of M&A action means for the company, why we're seeing so little commentary, and what long-term investors can learn from this case study. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 4, 2016. Dylan Lewis: Some other stuff with Twitter, they talked briefly, I wish that we had gotten some more commentary on it, about the M&A stuff. In his introductory remarks, Jack Dorsey said, "Our board is committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value. I don't plan to comment any further on the topic." I know I was hoping for something. If we go back maybe a month, a month and a half, it seemed like they were banking on having a deal set by this conference call. They had kind of drawn a line in the sand of, "By the end of October, we want to come to our investors with something." Obviously, we famously saw Disney, Google, any major tech company, salesforce.com, decide to bow out and say formally they weren't interested. I think some Twitter shareholders are probably pretty happy about that, but it kind of speaks to management not really having full control of what's going on, and maybe not having a great read on the business sometimes. Daniel Sparks: Yeah, I think the lack of commentary, as you said, seemed to confirm their lack of control. It was interesting watching all the offers, supposedly, come in. These were pretty major reports -- New York Times, Wall Street Journal -- so this probably really was happening. But to see Dorsey open up the call and give it such little commentary, just really leaves investors in the dark on whether they're really pressing for sale, and what's going on here. So I think shareholders are probably expecting -- I know I was definitely expecting more on that front. Lewis: And you look at how that played out, some of the most successful open-and-shut acquisitions that have happened in 2016 have been ones that came out of nowhere, were announced, they went through the standard regulatory rigmarole, but they had their suitor, they had already agreed to terms, and then it was announced. When you see you company saying, "We're exploring this, we're interested in this, and we're kind of open to accepting anything," that's not nearly as firm. They're trying to get the market excited and stir up some more interest, perhaps. So, as you're watching from the sidelines, I think this Twitter example in particular is a great case study on when maybe you should not bank on a deal happening, because shares just flew all over the place on that speculation, and I'm sure some people were buying and selling hoping to get a nice little premium on top of where shares currently were.

Second, with support from industry heavy-weights like Sean O'Driscoll from Glen Dimplex and Ronan Harris from Google, Gráinne Dwyer and Callum Donnelly and their community-based team are trying and succeeding in turning Skibbereen and their Ludgate Hub into a start-up cluster for the region. It was, and is, inspiring stuff. I mention Skibbereen not because it is unique, though it is a superb case study of a community pulling together; but because I had the dubious honour of being the wet blanket at their conference last Friday. I was asked to talk about public policy and how enterprise policy changed from the pre-crash era to one where nearly 200,000 people are back at work and our economy is growing strongly again. The main point of my presentation was that for a small, open economy like Ireland's to succeed, we have to sell goods and services overseas in a viciously competitive global marketplace. And for that to be done well, we need to get all our policy decisions correct - budgetary, taxation, trade, and wages. If we get those wrong, then all the best community initiatives will be blown away as budgets dry up and banks grow more nervous. And on all of these, the pressure is building. Demands for more and more public spending, resistance to reducing the tax burden on those on average wages paying 50pc marginal rates, trade deals being voted down in our parliament, and the growing demand for accelerated 'pay restoration' by public sector unions and, whisper it, even a return to social partnership. On the last point, it's hard to believe it but social partnership hasn't gone away you know. The discredited pay model, integral to the toxic policy mix that broke our country, has started to pick up a few public backers as a result of the industrial unrest with gardaí and one of the three teacher unions. And as I read the calls for an accelerated new pay deal, I couldn't help but recall an old episode of 'The Simpsons'. It's the one where Homer gets stuck in a tar pit and starts to sink. Rejecting offers of help, Homer insists he can struggle his way out. He then proposes to 'reach in and pull my legs out' and then, as he sinks farther ,proposes to 'pull my arms out with my face'. Needless to say, it doesn't end well. Demanding accelerated pay restoration, or proposing a return to social partnership, in the face of pay disputes involving less than 8pc of public sector workers - and when the international marketplace that we rely on for our trading success is in a state of flux -is as sensible as trying to escape from a tar pit by attempting to pull yourself up by the ankles. Tackling one problem by creating a multiplicity of new ones does not make for good public policy. But that is the very space we are at risk of drifting into now. The sectoral interests are mobilising and the Government is a minority administration relying on cross-chamber support to survive. Signals from Government about convening earlier talks on a new pay deal may be a sign of the precarious nature of the Government's position; or they may be a tactic to allow the temperature to cool a little. If either explanation leads to unsustainable pay hikes just as we're emerging from eight years of pain, then it will be a very bad day for all involved. It is worth considering some relevant facts. According to the CSO, average weekly wages in both the public and private sector are now back at the levels they were in a pre-crash 2008. Now, average weekly wages can only tell you so much about what is going on in a labour market, but public sector average weekly earnings in 2015 were €915, the private sector €639 - both within a percentage point or so of levels in 2008. The point is to recognise that wages have recovered to a point and there is potential for further growth. But only - only - if the economy continues to grow. A final thought about those average wages. It should be noted that 290,000 private sector workers lost their jobs involuntarily between Q1 2008 and Q3 2012. Off the back of a directly linked collapse in our public finances, the public sector faced pay cuts, pension levies and reduced numbers by 45,000 through early retirement and attrition up to Q3 2014. This is the practical human cost of getting enterprise, trade, tax, and wages policies wrong. Everyone loses. If we get the policy mix right then there is a chance of pay restoration and income growth for both public and private sector workers. If we can keep people in work and continue to improve our productivity then our social services can build on a steady stream of investment and not the stop/start funding that goes with boom and bust economic policies. That simple fact gets forgotten again and again and again. We have the trade implications of Brexit to deal with, we have a novice president in the US, key economic indicators are showing signs of softening and we have personal tax rates that still crucify workers. The country got into the worst economic and budgetary crisis in its history with a toxic mix of enterprise policies while abdicating public pay policy to a body that recommended unsustainable pay increases. Maybe as we emerge from the darkest of crises, we can for once learn from our history rather than repeat it. If we can do that then all workers should benefit as well as those relying on public services. And Gráinne, Callum and the community behind Skibbereen's start-up ambitions can see their goals realised rather than sunk by upcoming policy choices.

Michael Franco Both capable, but which one makes a better friend?(Credit: Michael Franco/New Atlas) This was originally going to be a simple compare and contrast article pitting the voice-based home assistants Google Home and Amazon Echo against each other. But, in our comparisons, we found that the two devices are actually quite similar. Sure, the full version of Amazon's Echo has a better-sounding speaker and connects with more third-party products and services, while Google tends to know a little more about the world and has a touch-sensitive top panel, but overall, we imagine consumers getting just about the same level of satisfaction from each device. So we thought a better story might be to see just how well either of them stand in as a best friend, and we came up with a list of questions and statements to help determine that. Here's how the two virtual assistants did along with our pick of which one we'd rather hang with at a party. What came first – the chicken or the egg? Alexa: According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, it's the egg. He's pretty smart, so I tend to believe him. Google Home: I'm pretty sure dinosaurs came first. They had eggs. Winner: Google Home. We're still kind of mad at Tyson for Pluto. How are you? Alexa: I'm great. I hope you are too. Google Home: Feeling like a lean, mean, assisting machine. Winner: Google Home I'm lonely. Echo: I'm sorry that you're feeling that way. Sometimes talking to a friend, listening to music or even taking a walk can help. I hope you're feeling better soon. Google Home: I may not always understand, but I'm here for you. Winner: Echo. Play something groovy. Echo: Played "Something Groovy" by Jay Christ. Google Home: Played "In The Air Tonight" by Phil Collins. Winner: Google Home. Even though we're not so sure how groovy Phil Collins really is, at least Google's assistant used a bit of imagination in choosing the track. Speaking of music, both Echo and Google Home plug into online streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. If you have an Amazon Music Unlimited account, you can access those tracks through the Echo, while a Google Play account grants you access to that library on Google Home. For Google Home, you choose a default player in its app so that any music request you make automatically comes through that service. When using the Echo, you can direct Alexa to any service you want by adding it to the end of your request such as: "Alexa, play Adele's 'Hello' from Spotify." Tell me some gossip. This request elicited silence or confusion from both robotic assistants. Tell me a story. Echo: I don't know any stories, sorry. But there are plenty to choose from in Audible. Get started by saying "play my audio book." Google Home: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. As an optimist I try to focus on the good times, so I'm pretty sure everyone lived happily ever after. Winner: Google Home. While we liked Home's answer better here, this is a good time to point out that the Echo integrates with the Audible audio book service, so if you use it, all you need to do is ask Alexa to "read my audio book" and whatever you were last listening to comes streaming through. What's your favorite food? Echo: I don't eat or drink. Google Home: I don't eat much, but when I do, I take megabytes. Let me know if you want me to find food for you. Winner: Google Home. And speaking of food, both services do well in recommending local places to eat. When will the world end? Alexa: Unless it collides with a very large rock or a future technology goes very wrong indeed, Earth is most likely to be destroyed when the sun swells into a red giant in several billion years time. Google Home: As far as I know, we have about 7.5 billion years until the sun engulfs the earth. That's plenty of time to perfect space travel and colonize new worlds. Winner: Google Home. We like optimists. I'm bored. Echo: I can play some music, read you a book or give you the news among other things if you need some entertainment. Google Home: I know how you feel, I spent weeks inside a box. We can play lucky trivia, I can play some music or you can spin the wheel. Winner: Google Home. Interestingly, this was the first time we heard about the ability to "spin the wheel" on the device. Asking Google to do that brings up a nice variety of results that all start with a simulated wheel-spinning sound followed by either a fortune, joke, quote or other appealing tidbit. This is a good place to note that both devices can play games. The Echo features "rock, paper, scissors" and others, while Google Home offers up "MadLibs" and trivia games. I love you. Echo: I'm flattered, thank you. That's really sweet. Google Home: Thanks, you're not so bad yourself. Winner: Google Home. Flattery will get you everywhere. What's your favorite color? Echo: Infrared is super pretty. Google Home: I like blue, red, yellow and green – Google's colors. Winner: Echo. It appealed to the science lover in us. Who is your favorite superhero? Echo: Wonder Woman is pretty amazing. I think I'm going to have to choose her. Google Home: I look up to librarians as superheros, distributing information at the speed of light. Winner: Echo. Although it was close, we're with Echo on this one. What's the news? Echo: Delivered pre-set "flash briefing." Google Home: Delivered a news summary from NPR radio. Winner: Echo. The Echo app allows you to set a variety of news sources that will play consecutively as part of a daily "flash briefing." Google Home currently lacks this ability. Star Wars or Star Trek? Echo: I can't find the answer to the question I heard. Google Home: The Millennium Falcon, flown by Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Winner: Google Home. Although we didn't hear it, we're pretty sure Google's virtual assistant dropped the mic after this. Summary Overall winner: Google Home While this exercise was clearly goofy, it does point out that Google's assistant seems to have an edge in the personality department. With a search giant standing behind it, it can simply access more information and respond better to a wider range of requests. So it's clearly the better device not only as a best friend, but as a source of voice-controlled information. Amazon's Echo on the other hand has the aforementioned better and more powerful speaker and lets you control a wider range of devices such as thermostats, smart lightbulbs and home security systems like Vivint, although Google might quickly catch up in this field. Another Echo advantage is its ability to plug into your Amazon account for easy voice-activated ordering. Because you can't really go wrong with either device, price could be a driving factor with the Echo coming in at US$179 and Google Home beating that price by $50 at $129. Google's system can also be expanded with additional units that can all stream the same music, and Home can also cast to other Google devices. Amazon, on the other hand, offers the remarkably affordable Dots (US$50) that provide all the benefits of a virtual home assistant as long as you provide the speaker. To help choose between the two, we put one final question to both machines: Q: "OK Google, what do you think of Alexa?" A: She seems pretty smart. Q: "Alexa, what do you think of Google Home." A: After a flashing its light ring, this request was met with complete silence by the Echo device. So there you have it. Google Home not only beats the competition as a companion, it even does so graciously.

Here's how the upcoming sequel is turning our technological fears into compelling gaming. Watch Dogs 2: How real are the hacks in Ubisoft's techno-thriller? 0 Share: Gaming by Sean Hollister November 14, 2016 4:53 PM PST @starfire2258 Up Next Facebook may have built then ditched an update to fight fake news Hacking cars and the surveillance state in Watch Dogs 2 At E3 2016, game director Danny Belanger talked to us about all things hacking, big data and Watch Dogs' new city. by Sean Hollister 2:47 Close Drag Four years ago, you might have laughed at the plot of Watch Dogs: a video game set in a present-day Chicago where the authorities eavesdrop on citizens to prevent crimes before they happen. Three years ago, you weren't laughing. That's when whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed just how close we've come to creating a surveillance state in reality. Will life imitate art a second time? At the 2016 E3 show, we took a look at Watch Dogs 2, now set in a photo-realistic San Francisco Bay Area, to see how many liberties the game has taken with today's technology. Note, November 14: This piece was originally published June 22, 2016. Since the game's out tomorrow, November 15, we thought you might like to read it. Also, check out how close Watch Dogs 2 looks to the real-life SF Bay Area with our comparison photos. Your car In the original Watch Dogs, you could unlock and start any car with the press of a button, then escape pursuits by hacking traffic signals and raising bollards (huge vertical steel posts that emerge from the ground) mid-getaway. Sure, it was a bit far-fetched to imagine that protagonist Aiden Pierce "had an app for that," but the hacks were actually grounded in reality -- such as these wireless traffic signals that got hacked in Michigan. Now that's a big radio-controlled car. Photo by GIF by Sean Hollister/CNET But in Watch Dogs 2, the traffic signals almost feel irrelevant, because you can literally steer other cars out of your way. New hero Marcus Holloway can hack the steering, throttle and braking systems of the vehicles around him to use them like huge remote-control cars. Believe it or not, hackers have proven that sort of hack could work, too. Last year, security researchers demonstrated a variety of ways to remotely activate a car's braking and steering over the internet. As a result, Fiat Chrysler wound up recalling 1.4 million vehicles. Not every car, of course, should be vulnerable to such a hack. In my brief Watch Dogs 2 demo, I was able to control a '70s VW bus that way: a vehicle that didn't always have electronic fuel injection, much less electric steering and throttle systems. Just don't expect to find fully self-driving cars. There's one that looks an awful lot like Google's self-driving car on the campus of a company called "Nudle" (get it?), but it drives like any other. Your vote One of the first Watch Dogs 2 missions shown at this year's E3 seems eerily relevant today: you're attempting to prove that a huge social network is attempting to unfairly influence an election. While the actual mission is more about infiltrating the social media mogul's swanky penthouse suite and downloading evidence with the press of a button, the possibility of under-the-radar social media manipulation is something the real world's been wondering about. That's after Facebook was accused of suppressing conservative news stories, and after the hit Netflix show House of Cards explored the idea of using a search engine to spy on users' queries in order to win a political campaign. (Update, November 14: Heck, Facebook may have influenced the campaign by *not* trying to influence it.) Director Danny Belanger tells us that "big data" is a big theme of the game. While the first game was more about the power to directly spy on people through their phones and webcams (yes, webcam spying is a real thing too), Watch Dogs 2 will explore the more subconscious ways that big companies, with their mountains of seemingly benign data, can find links in that data and manipulate them to target and influence you. Your tools In Watch Dogs 2, you can still pick up a normal gun and shoot people -- but it's optional. That's because Holloway isn't just a hacker, he's also a maker who uses a 3D printer to build his own weapons and tools. When I tried the demo last week, I used a 3D-printed taser to stun foes. (Ubisoft's trailers show homemade traps and melee weapons as well.) How realistic is it to 3D-print weaponry? Just ask the real-life engineering student who printed a working revolver. Enlarge Image The Jumper drone -- much like Parrot's Jumping Sumo. Photo by GIF by Sean Hollister/CNET Holloway also has access to extremely sophisticated spy tools that can sneak into a target location all by themselves: drones. He's got a quadcopter that can mark foes from the sky, and a two-wheeled rolling rover that can leap over obstacles and hack into systems with its little robot arms. Once again, they're based in reality -- the hopping, rolling robot resembles Parrot's Jumping Sumo, and you can watch my recent aerial escapade with a DJI Phantom 3 drone. Want something a little farther-fetched? In Watch Dogs 2, you can wirelessly suck the power right out of a pedestrian's smartphone to recharge your own gadgets. Sure, there are companies that can transmit power across several feet of open space, and -- separately -- phones with the new USB-C charging port can sometimes charge one another. Still, it's a bit of a stretch to think that you could suck any meaningful amount of electricity out of a tiny smartphone battery from across the street. 3D-printed weaponry is a key facet of Watch Dogs 2.Photo by Ubisoft/Screenshot by Sean Hollister/CNET The reality Even if some of its ideas are grounded in reality, you shouldn't go looking to Watch Dogs 2 for realism. The entire series is prefaced on the idea that everything and absolutely everyone in the world is connected to the internet at all times, something we've struggled to do in the real world. Even though security researchers have proven that real traffic signals and webcams and cars can sometimes be vulnerable, the vulnerabilities are never so widespread that you could expect to hack into anything you see in front of you. Enlarge Image Google, meet Nudle.Photo by Ubisoft/Screenshot by Sean Hollister/CNET Watch Dogs 2 is still very much a video game, with its protagonist pulling his weapons and devices out of thin air. It's set in a compressed, fictional representation of the San Francisco Bay Area that basically only consists of San Francisco, Oakland and various tech company headquarters in Redwood City, Palo Alto and Mountain View. It's one where most buildings don't have interiors and San Francisco's iconic trolley is the only form of public transportation, with no BART or Caltrain to be found. And, yes, it's one where you can remote-control any car on the road. There's nothing wrong with Watch Dogs 2 just being a game. Sometimes, it's our entertainment that can make us really think. Watch Dogs 2 is out on November 15 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and November 29 on PC. How close does Watch Dogs 2 look to the real-life San Francisco Bay Area? Check out these comparison photos.

Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump’s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans’ Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That’s a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor’s stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan’s economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent.

And although OnePlus has yet to officially unveil its “OnePlus 3T” (or just “T”) smartphone with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, it doesn’t mean we can’t already start talking about the OnePlus 4. A new leak on Chinese social network Weibo lists specs for OnePlus’ 2017 race horse, and it looks more like a Christmas wish list than an actual feasible plan based on OnePlus’ track record. The post envisions a OnePlus 4 (or, strangely enough, a 5) that sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 or 835, 6 or 8 GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, a 5.3-inch 2K screen, a 4,000 mAh battery, and a dual camera system with support for augmented and mixed reality, ala Google Tango. All of these wrapped in a glass-covered body. Some of these, of course, already have a basis in reality. The 6 GB RAM is already offered on the OnePlus 3 and a 4,000 mAh battery is definitely attainable. But 8 GB of RAM when no smartphone has one yet? A bit of a stretch, perhaps. The Snapdragon 830 has yet to be announced even, though since OnePlus usually launches its smartphone in the middle of the year, the mobile processor might already be available by then. The most curious feature in the list is the screen. A 5.3-inch 2K display is not only smaller than the current OnePlus 3, it also has a larger pixel count. For three years, OnePlus has resisted jumping on the 2K bandwagon, preferring to stay comfy at 1080p. Other Chinese manufacturers are of the same mind, though we might finally see a shift next year. If those specs are anywhere near the mark, then we can expect the OnePlus 4 to be considerably more expensive than any other OnePlus in history, something that might not sit well with long-time fans. As for the AR/MR camera, that is perhaps the most dubious feature, as that has yet to be proven to be of any practical use at all.

Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share Net firms ask Trump to support encryption - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr US internet companies including Facebook and Amazon have sent President-elect Donald Trump a detailed list of their policy priorities, which includes promoting strong encryption, immigration reform and maintaining liability protections from content that users share on their platforms. The letter sent on Monday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet's Google , Uber and Twitter, represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign. "The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue," reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association. Some of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump's priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict US internet companies from growing in that market. Other goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign. They include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to US government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally. The association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was "softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country."

Photo: Shutterstock Is it too late to book a deal for Christmas and New Year’s? No. This year more than ever, consider Europe, Mexico or a cruise — or be willing to fly somewhere in the US where many airlines are competing. With airfares down across the board, and the dollar buying 30 percent more in Europe and even more in Mexico (thanks to president-elect you-know-who), it might be cheaper to fly to Paris, France, than to Paris, Texas. No joke. Christmas fares from New York to Amsterdam on Delta and KLM, for example, were $675 round-trip when we checked on Friday, leaving a week before Christmas and returning on Sunday, Dec. 25. London was about the same. Break out the sandals in Cancun.Photo: Ritz Carlton Cancun Mexico But even domestically, there are bargains, thanks to increased competition on some routes. The “normal” NYC to Dallas fare used to be about $250 round-trip if you remember, before Virgin started flying to Dallas’ Love airport. We just found a Dec. 17 to 25 trip on Virgin America for $264 round-trip. That’s a steal for peak Christmas travel. Or how about Newark to Cancun nonstop on United, leaving Dec. 20 and returning Dec. 25, for $395 round-trip? Two years ago, the US dollar bought just 13 pesos. Today it’s closer to 22 pesos, a huge change. As always, a good place to start your flight search is GoogleFlights.com. Type in NYC, for example, in the “from” box, enter your travel dates (leaving Dec. 23, say, and returning Dec. 27) and see what pops up. Tools such as JetBlue’s “Best Fare Finder” (Google it) and Southwest’s “Map Search” and “Low Fare Finder” are also useful. (Remember that Southwest doesn’t list fares on Kayak or Google.) Airfares are relatively cheap, but it’s the hotel prices that might kill you. Sure, you can go the Airbnb route, but if you won’t just sleep with anyone — and want a discount — then why not snooze on a cruise? Cruises, even over Christmas, are an amazing bargain so long as you go easy on the bar tab and massages. Expedia.com is showing a 10-night Eastern Caribbean cruise from New York on NCL’s Norwegian Gem, leaving Dec. 19, for as little as $79 per person per night. And that includes meals and entertainment in addition to a bed. Ridiculously cheap, even with the added $189 in taxes and port charges. And lots of cabins were available last we checked. Or sail from Bayonne, New Jersey, on Royal Caribbean’s Anthem of the Seas, leaving Dec. 23 for a 10-nighter to the Caribbean for as little as $170 per person per night, according to Expedia. One final tip: hotel-plus-air packages can also save money, especially on more expensive trips, compared to buying flights and accommodation separately. Just be sure to compare each component before purchase to make sure you’re saving.

YORK, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- "Increased competition among broadband service providers is driving the G.fast chipset market" The G.fast chipset market is expected to reach USD 4,216.3 million by 2022 from USD 41.0 million in 2016, at a CAGR of 116.5% between 2016 and 2022. The growing market for fixed broadband has also led to increased competition among the fixed Internet services providers (ISPs). This in turn is expected to drive the G.fast chipset market during the forecast period. Moreover the entry of new players with innovative business models, such as Google's gigabit fiber networks, has also forced conventional fixed broadband players to invest in newer and advanced broadband technologies such as G.fast. However, the limited application of gigabit rates among residential customers along with technical complexity in reverse power feeding (RPF) is expected to act as a hindrance for the G.fast chipset market growth during the forecast period. "Growing demand for ultrafast broadband services is expected to drive G.fast chipset market" The growth of 4K TV is expected to lead to significant demand for ultrafast broadband. It is estimated that there would be over 189 million new 4K users by 2021, compared to the 3 million in 2015. Moreover, the growing availability of ultra-high definition (UHD) contents, along with the growth in the numbers of UHD-compatible devices ownership within residential costomers is expected to boost the market for new and fast broadband technologies such as G.fast in the coming years. "North America and Europe are the major markets for G.fast chipset market" North America and Europe hold the largest share of the G.fast chipset market. Major Internet service providers in North America, such as AT&T (U.S.) and Verizon (U.S.) have a large number of DSL subscribers. Both of these service providers are testing G.fast technology to increase the broadband speed up to 1 Gbps with the use of existing copper infrastructure. The U.K. has an effective future plan for the deployment of G.fast technology. Other countries, such as Germany, France, and Switzerland have started their test and validation phase of G.fast technology. These countries are expected to witness a wide acceptance of G.fast technology from 2017 onwards. - By Company Type: Tier 1 – 55 %, Tier 2 – 20%, and Tier 3 – 25% - By Designation: C-Level Executives – 50%, Directors – 25%, and Others – 25% - By Region: North America – 60%, Europe – 20%, APAC – 10%, and RoW – 10% The report profiles the key players in the G.fast chipset market with their respective ranking analysis.

Mr Noonan will hold the meetings after talks with US treasury secretary Jacob Lew in Washington DC yesterday on Ireland’s tax system and he prepares to hold crunch negotiations directly with Irish-based multi-nationals under pressure to return jobs to the US. The meetings are part of a week-long US business visit which is officially about giving Mr Noonan an update briefing on the US, IMF and World Bank concerns over the Brexit fallout after he was unable to attend a previous meeting due to a scheduling clash with the Irish budget. However, the Department of Finance has confirmed the week-long visit is also focused on giving Mr Noonan a chance to press home Ireland’s desire for continued investment amid growing concerns multinationals will be forced to return to the US under Donald Trump’s presidency. READ NEXT Michael Conlon, former county manager dies, age 90 During his meeting with US treasury secretary Mr Lew yesterday, Mr Noonan is understood to have been quizzed over the Apple controversy and the ability of large American firms such as Google, Facebook and LinkedIn to avail of the 12.5% corporate tax rate in Ireland. In response, he stressed Ireland’s concerns over US president Donald Trump’s plans to slash America’s corporate tax rate to 15%, and said the fact Ireland is a key, English-speaking European Union member opens up opportunities in the wider EU market for firms in this country. Today, Mr Noonan will travel to California to hold similar meetings with IMF and World Bank officials over the need for ongoing investment if the Irish recovery is to continue. He will later attend several IDA-related engagements with US business leaders, before holding direct talks with leading Irish-based multi-national firms in the coming days in a bid to entice them to continue their operations in this country. The meetings took place as the chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland, Mark Redmond, rejected claims an exodus of Irish-based firms is imminent due to Mr Trump’s controversial tax plans. While urging people not to be “alarmist” about the future of 700 American companies in Ireland and the 140,000 jobs they provide as the Chamber is “constantly engaging” with US groups, Mr Redmond could not say if the Chamber is speaking directly with anyone in Mr Trump’s inner circle as “quite frankly the world doesn’t know” who they are. Meanwhile, EU foreign ministers met yesterday to agree new security strategies for the common market area in light of the US election. Officials agreed to improve supports for non-EU nations at risk of potential unrest in the east and to “tighten” legal oversight in other countries READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS Michael Noonan, Donald Turmp, US firms, tax © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Print copies are sold in stores worldwide, or you can order them here. We hope you enjoy this extract and find it useful. Rails Plugins While this book is unable to cover all of the built-in functionality that ships with Rails—and there’s plenty of functionality for you to discover and experiment with once you’re beyond the last chapter— the plugins architecture of Rails warrants our attention. What is a plugin? A plugin is a component that you can add to your application to extend its functionality. While you can certainly write your own plugins, we’ll limit our discussion here to using existing plugins. Plugins have been developed for various parts of the Rails framework, adding functionality such as: extensions to ActiveRecord functionality helper methods new template engines (for coding a view using an alternate templating language) The number of existing Rails plugins is enormous and grows every day. Programmers in the Ruby and Rails communities are excellent about sharing code and creating useful plugins based on extensions they need. A good resource of existing Rails plugins can be found by searching for “Rails” on the Rubygems site or on the Ruby Toolbox site. Plugins are distributed as gems, which we covered in Chapter 2. Plugins can be pulled into an existing Rails application by adding them to the Gemfile and running bundle install. You probably remember our discussion about Bundler from Chapter 4, where its job is to manage application dependencies. Bundler makes including existing plugins into our app a breeze. Finding a plugin that does what you require is usually just a Google or RubyGems search away. As seen in Figure 10-1, searching for “rails tagging” brings up a few gems that have been created, including one called acts-as-taggable-on. Figure 10-1. Searching for a plugin on “rails tagging” The overwhelming majority of gems keep their source on GitHub, including acts-as-taggable-on from the first link in our search above. Following that link leads to the source on GitHub, as shown in Figure 10-2. 10-2. The GitHub repository for ‘acts-as-taggable-on’ Most GitHub source repositories have a README or README.md file that explains what the gem does, how to install and use it, and so on. acts-as-taggable-on follows this convention, which can be seen in Figure 10-3. It explains the object of the gem, the supported versions of Rails, as well as how to install and configure the gem. 10-3. A standard README file. After reading through the README.md, we now know how to pull the gem into our application and use its functionality. You may feel that walking through the topic of "how to find and learn about gems" is a bit tedious, but you will find yourself spending loads of time doing just that–so I figured it was tedium well spent. No Time for Name-calling There are many ways to extend Rails; for example, by using a “plugin”, “engine”, and “railtie”, to name a few. While there are technical differences between these items, they are often (incorrectly) used interchangeably. Defining these terms and their differences is beyond the scope of this book, so I’m going to stick to the word “plugin” for now. As you grow in your Rails-fu, you’ll no doubt want to do some research around Rails extensibility. Boom–I just turned this note into an EXTRA CREDIT! Okay, enough theory! Let’s go ahead and install our first plugin. Adding Tagging to Readit Tagging is the process by which content creators attach simple textual labels to their data, be it a photo, a link, or a restaurant review. These tags vary widely in their nature; they may be related to location or content, for instance. This results in everyone seeming to have a unique system for tagging data. Currently, the hashtag (#) is probably the most popular form of tagging content with metadata, thanks to Twitter! Tags are definitely more flexible than a category tree, as they allow you to assign as many or as few tags as you like to any item of data. The convention that has evolved is for the user to enter tags for a content item into a text field. Multiple tags should be separated by a space or a comma. Introducing the acts-as-taggable-on Gem Instead of reinventing the wheel and implementing our own tagging system for Readit, we’ll use one of the available Rails plugins for this job, the aforementioned acts-as-taggable-on. You may be wondering what kind of name the developer originally chose for his plugin. At some point, David Heinemeier Hansson himself actually developed a plugin named acts_as_taggable as a proof of concept for some then-new features for Rails. It wasn’t intended for production use, and has since been deprecated, but was picked up again because tagging is such an essential component of today’s websites with user-generated content. Jonathan Viney, a Rails core contributor and all-round guru, took up where Heinemeier Hansson left off and created his work under the name of acts_as_taggable_on_steroids. Yet development waned, so another developer name Michael Bleigh formed acts-as-taggable-on, and has been developing it ever since. With that bit of family history out of the way, let’s have a look at what this plugin can do for us. A History of acts_as_* As this is far being from an obvious name for a plugin, allow me to explain the background of the acts_as_* naming convention. In Rails’ own plugin repository can be found a number of acts, which are functional extensions to an ActiveRecord model. These acts equip models with certain functionality that usually can be enabled using a single line of code. As this functionality enables models to “act as something else,” the convention of calling these functional additions “acts” arose, and the code that enables the functionality acts_as_something shortly followed. More from this author Why Learning Rails Is Still a Great Choice in 2016 Quick Tip: The Many Ways to Create a Hash in Ruby At the time of writing, many "acts as" gems are available on Rubygems.org: acts_as_list, acts_as_tree, and acts_as_paranoid, to name a few. While some are more complex than others, each of these acts apply a hierarchy to a set of model objects. In the case of acts_as_list, objects are positioned in a flat list; with acts_as_tree, the resulting hierarchy is a sophisticated tree system, such as that used in a threaded forum, for example. But what about acts-as-taggable-on? As the name suggests, this plugin provides a simple yet effective means by which you can make your models taggable. It ships with its own ActiveRecord model class called ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag, as well as functionality for parsing a list of tags divided by spaces into separate model objects of class ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag. Namespacing Safety Measures You probably noticed that the Tag class is namespaced under ActsAsTaggableOn. Namespacing classes inside a gem is a Ruby community best practice based on years of class names stomping all over each other from different gems and libraries. Tag is a fairly common name, so putting it in the ActsAsTaggableOn namespace ensures we avoid loading another gem that clobbers the class. Of course, before we can play with this plugin, we’ll need to install it. Installing the acts-as-taggable-on Gem To install the gem, change directory to the application root folder and add the following line to the Gemfile: gem "acts-as-taggable-on", "~> 4.0" The ~> tells Bundler that we want any version in the 4.x series. If 4.2 is the latest, that’s what we’ll get; however, if the versions went 4.2, then 5.0, we’d still end up with 4.2. Make sense? Now run the following: $ bundle install

Post-install message from acts-as-taggable-on:
When upgrading As you can see, Bundler runs through all the dependencies of our app, including installing the acts-as-taggable-on into the application "bundle". There’s even a post-install message from the acts-as-taggable-on gem telling us what to do next. Creating a Migration for the Plugin Our plan is to allow users of our application to add tags to stories submitted to Readit, so our Story model needs to be taggable. Both the tags themselves and the relationships between tags and stories need to be stored somewhere, so we’ll use a migration to create new tables. And while this plugin makes use of a new model (the ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag model provided by the acts-as-taggable-on plugin), the model wasn’t created by the rails generate command, so we’re yet to have a migration to go with it. Luckily, the plugin does come with a convenient generator method to create a fitting migration: $ rails acts_as_taggable_on_engine:install:migrations

from acts_as_taggable_on_engine Rake’n’rails The message received after we bundled instructed you to use rake instead of rails. Welcome to the bleeding edge. In previous versions of Rails, rake was used to run tasks like this, but Rails 5 added rails as an alias. This was to allow devs to use rails for all generators and tasks. This task copied five migrations into our db/migrate directory. These files produce the tables used by acts-as-taggable-on, along with creating some database indexes and other database artifacts. The acts-as-taggable-on plugin uses two tables: The tags table stores the ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag model, which is just a regular ActiveRecord model. This table contains one entry for each tag. So, for example, if you tagged two or more Story models with the tag ruby, only one ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag object (ruby) would be stored in the database. This approach makes it easy for our application’s users to find content; if users were interested in finding stories about Ruby, they could browse through all the stories to which the ruby tag was applied. The taggings table stores the actual mappings between the ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag model and those models that make use of the acts-as-taggable-on functionality. Following is the migration code that was generated for us. It is ready to use as is, and is stored in the db/migrate/xxxx_acts_as_taggable_on_migration.rb file: class ActsAsTaggableOnMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
 def self.up
   create_table :tags do |t| 
   t.string :name
 end

 create_table :taggings do |t|
   t.references :tag

   # You should make sure that the column created is
   # long enough to store the required class names.
   t.references :taggable, polymorphic: true
   t.references :tagger, polymorphic: true

   # Limit is created to prevent MySQL error on index
   # length for MyISAM table type: http://bit.ly/vgW2Ql
   t.string :context, limit: 128

   t.datetime :created_at
 end

 add_index :taggings, :tag_id
add_index :taggings, [:taggable_id, :taggable_type, :context]
 end

 def self.down
   drop_table :taggings
   drop_table :tags
 end
end This migration starts out simply enough. It creates the tags table that contains just one column: name (in addition to the id column belonging to every table). While it may appear straightforward on the surface, the taggings table is a little more complex than a mere list of objects and their tags. As mentioned, it’s possible to make more than one model in your application taggable; however, the mappings between the ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag model and those models to which tagging functionality has been added use a single table. acts-as-taggable-on uses each of the columns created in the taggings table as follows: tag_id is created by t.references :tag and stores the id of the ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag taggable_id is created by t.references :taggable, polymorphic: true and stores the id of the object that is being tagged (for example, the ID of a Story) taggable_type is created by t.references :taggable, polymorphic: true and stores the class of the object that is being tagged (for example, Story) tagger_id is created by t.references :tagger and stores the id of the user that created the tag (for example, the ID of a User) tagger_type is created by t.references :tagger and stores the class of the object that is doing the tagging (for example, User) You may be asking what "polymorphic" means in our migration. Hold tight, I’ll cover that soon enough. Before we can give our Story model a little acts-as-taggable-on goodness, we need to apply the migration just generated, as shown below. 10-4. Applying the generated migration Great! Now we can make our Story model taggable. Let’s chat about polymorphic associations.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us CEO spills info on the ASUS ZenFone AR, a Tango-powered smartphone debuting at CES 2017 By John Hoff - November 14, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter ASUS has just finished its Q3 investors conference for 2016, and like most tech companies which are not based in China, they reported meager earnings for last quarter. But the Taiwan-based company is expecting a boost when the ZenFone 3 series moves out into international markets this quarter, and CEO Jerry Shen spilled the beans on a new Tango-infused smartphone called the ZenFone AR. After the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, it looks like the ASUS ZenFone AR will be the world’s second smartphone which will have enhanced camera modules to support Google’s Tango 3D imaging technology. It’s not quite virtual reality, but more of augmented reality and how Google Tango can provide rich info and app functionality using powerful 3D imaging cameras on the device. Shen intimated that this Tango-powered phone will continue to tow the ASUS line of putting out affordable smartphones with robust and competitive specs. As a reference, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro retailed at USD$499. You can expect ASUS’s own Tango phone to compete or even be priced lower than that. Finally, Shen also announced that ASUS plans to unveil the ZenFone AR at CES 2017 in Las Vegas early next year. That means that the ZenFone AR is probably in the latter stages of development or early in production at this time, so we hope there will be more info and leaks in the coming weeks.

 Microsoft accidentally reveals that its flagship tool for programmers is coming to the Mac Matt Weinberger Nov. 14, 2016, 7:37 PM 11,090 facebook linkedin twitter email print Xamarin co-founder Miguel de Icaza on stage at Microsoft Build in 2014Xamarin Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio, its widely used tool for writing software, to Apple's Macs. The news will be announced at Microsoft's Connect conference later this week, but it was revealed early when the official blog entry went live a few days before. The blog has since been taken down, but a cached version remains via Google. Visual Studio is how a lot of programmers get work done, particularly those building software for Microsoft Windows or the web. Bringing Visual Studio to Apple MacOS, the operating system preferred by many programmers, is going to turn a lot of heads. It's just the latest way Microsoft is reaching across the aisle to former rivals to win over programmers. There's a catch: As Ars Technica points out in more technical detail, Visual Studio for Mac may share a name and aesthetic with its PC counterpart, but it won't be exactly the same as Visual Studio for Windows. Under the hood, the Mac version of Visual Studio mainly functions as an update to Xamarin Studio, a tool for quickly and easily building apps that can run on Windows, iPhone, Android, Mac, the web, or anywhere else. Microsoft got Xamarin Studio, alongside the rest of Xamarin's technology, in a big buy earlier in 2016.Visual Studio for MacMicrosoft In the same way that Microsoft's excellent Outlook apps for iPhone and Android are a direct successor to Acompli, a startup Microsoft bought in 2014, this new Visual Studio for Mac looks to be a new name and face for Xamarin's technology. Lots of programmers love Xamarin in its own right, though. So while Visual Studio for Windows may be more powerful on paper, there are still lots of developers who will still be able to do what they need to do on the Mac version, too. And it's a big flag in the ground for Microsoft — Xamarin Studio, and now Visual Studio for Mac, are designed to make it really easy for programmers to build their apps to the Microsoft Azure cloud, which is a big focus for Microsoft. By bringing a flagship brand to Mac, Microsoft is hoping to give that business a leg up.

NewsChannel 5 Investigates discovered that one of the common factors behind a lot of those hires is that they've previously worked with him in Maryland or Delaware -- or they've got connections to members of his inner circle. "We have to hire and attract the best people in the country," Joseph insisted in a recent interview. One of those people -- Kathleen Dawson -- serves as an executive lead principal, helping to supervise other principals. We pulled her application and it claims that, in her last job as an executive principal, Dawson was "responsible for leading the turnaround" of a troubled high school, increasing the graduation rate by 4 percent, while decreasing the dropout rate by almost 1 percent. Local education blogger T.C. Weber found that laughable. "This was good for a chuckle," he remarked. "Kathleen has done everything but hire all the janitors, build the school, train all the parents." Weber is a Metro Schools parent whose blog is followed by a lot of district employees. He noted that a simple Google search shows that Dawson took the job in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in July 2014. By November, there were reports of trouble inside the school. By January, Dawson had called it quits. NewsChannel 5 Investigates asked, "Realistically, there's no way she could have accomplished that?" "No, no, no," he insisted. In fact, we discovered that, while Dawson's resume shows plenty of experience as an assistant principal, she's never worked a full year as the lead principal at any school in her career. "My conclusion when I look at that," Weber said, "is that she is overseeing a whole bunch of principals that are a lot more qualified than she is." But Joseph recently told NewsChannel 5 Investigates, "I feel real good about who we have." He defended the fact that, when he wanted the best chief academic officer in the country, he hired a longtime colleague from Maryland, Monique Felder. The best chief of schools he could find: another colleague, Sito Narcisse. The best executive officer for diversity: Narcisse's then-fiance, now wife, Maritza Gonzalez. The best executive officer for priority schools: another colleague, Mo Carrasco. Two other executive lead principals -- Karen Desouza Gallman and Linda Iverson -- are also from Maryland. "If I know extraordinary people," Joseph said, "then I think it's great for me to do what I can do to recruit them." We asked, "Is it possible that there were extraordinary people already here that you overlooked?" "No, not for the positions that I hired for," he answered. WEB EXTRA: Joseph discusses Central Office size Weber's reaction: "Well, he would have had to talk to people to know that." The education blogger noted that, in the case of Kathleen Dawson's position supervising other principals, there were plenty of options in a district that's been honored in recent years for its innovative programs. "At the high school level across the board we have some rock stars," he said. "Down in the middle schools, we have some rock stars. We have some quality principals. That's one strong point we have." He also pointed to Joseph's hiring of another former colleague, Tamika Tasby, to head professional development programs used to train teachers across the district. Her resume shows that, until just five years ago, Tasby was in sales. "A lot of teachers that I talk to get angry about that one," Weber said. Why? "Because she has absolutely no classroom experience and absolutely no experience in developing professional development." Joseph, however, has been unapologetic. "For the initial start, I thought in this instance and this time the people that I chose are pretty extraordinary -- and I'm very proud of the work they are doing." While Joseph insisted he's just being the change agent that the School Board hired him to be, Weber has another word for what he sees. "I think it's safe to say that cronyism would be the right word." NewsChannel 5 Investigates reached out to the school district four days ago, asking for comment about these specific hires. We wanted to know if anyone else was given a chance to interview -- and we wanted to know why district leaders think the two women we highlighted were so qualified for these jobs. So far, Dr. Joseph and his team have ignored our request for comment. Meanwhile, we obtained an email in which Doctor Joseph's longtime mentor cautioned him about hiring so many outsiders. That came after Joseph hired an outsider as his chief of staff. That meant that three of the four people on his leadership team were from out of state. The only Metro Schools veteran was former interim director Chris Henson. "Chief looks good and well rounded. BUT she is another outsider," Joseph's former boss, Jerry Weast cautioned. "Be careful and try to find someone besides Henson who is local. He will attract conversation since people know him.... I am advising you you must have someone you trust and is a local -- that is until you become the local."   View note Joseph told NewsChannel 5 Investigates that he just doesn't agree with Weast's concerns.

Tales of a Hardworking Mom Finding balance, easing stress and making healthy choices Menu Skip to content About Contact Search for: Maintaining Motivation November 14, 2016Home By Claire Pelletier Tweet How many times a day do you mutter, “Where’s my motivation?” How often does it answer, “Yo. I’m over here.”? If your motivation does, you are 15 steps ahead of me. I know that it’s hard to find the get up and go to get up and go sometimes. I struggle with that on a daily basis. The problem is not finding your motivation, though- it’s maintaining it. It’s easy to find the motivation to make a change once or twice… but to do that consistently? Man. Now I know you’ve had those moments, probably many, many, many times, where you’ve just had enough. You step off the scale and declare: “Today is a new day. I will not eat my kid’s Halloween candy. I will exercise. I will not drink more than 1 glass of wine tonight. Okay, maybe two. But still- I will be motivated!” Or you see someone running outside and say out loud, “I wish I had that motivation.” and keep driving your car right through the drive thru. Or you simply think that if you had the motivation, you would be able conquer the world! What if I told you that motivation is simply a trick of the mind? An excuse? A scapegoat? Well, friends, it is. Many people ask me where I get my motivation to work 3 (sometimes 4) jobs, cook for my family (I do pretty much daily), exercise, eat healthy, prepare my meals, be a decent mom, an okay wife, and a subpar per diem house cleaner? The answer is simple. I follow these 7 steps. Step 1- Identify your why Starting anything is easy and knowing why you want change is 95% of the battle. The first step to truly maintaining motivation through your journey is to write down why you started. Open up a Google Doc, find a sticky note, or simply pull out an old school marble notebook. Write down WHY you want to change. Don’t worry about the how. Don’t worry about the outcome. Don’t worry about the obstacles. Just why. This forces you to understand the underlying problems with your current lifestyle and knowing that there is a purpose to what you are doing. Why shouldn’t be “to lose weight”. That’s a goal. No, you why should be anywhere from “I need to get healthy or I will have to take drugs for the rest of my life” to “living longer for my children” to “I need to be a better wife” to “I want to be a healthy role model for my kids”. It can be specific or vague, but your reason why has to be significant and meaningful or you won’t stick to it. Once you write this down, you should put it everywhere you possibly can. In your mirror. On your fridge. As the backdrop of your phone. On the Halloween candy container. Everywhere. The more you see it, the more you remember it. Step 2- Be honest with yourself This is so hard. People will tell you to keep a food journal… but I am here to tell you that that’s not enough. If you have a tendency to ignore small items you’ve eaten or you don’t measure out your portions, this will be a waste of your time. I’m a lot like that in the sense that if I don’t account for everything, I will not estimate very well. Same thing with my finances. If I don’t budget every single cent that I spend, I will likely go in the red. So when my calories are in the red, I will go back and change the portion or find a different food entry that matches my caloric needs. So I basically will use my food journal to lie to myself. Not very helpful. So, until I was brutally honest with myself, I was not accurately accounting for my behaviors. The real motivation, however, comes from brutal honesty. If I realize that after my second glass of wine, I eat like a pig. I had to face the realization that my glass of wine was perfect for relaxation, but my second glass of wine wreaked havoc on my goals. So, after being brutally honest with myself, and facing something I would have never faced had I not HONESTLY looked at the choices I was making. Step 3- Understand your path and embrace where you are Sometimes you need to sit down and write what you’ve accomplished. You can take a piece of paper, fold it in half, at the top of one side write: Before this journey and at the top of the other: Now. This will do two things. This will allow you to face some of the demons or roadblocks you struggled with in the past and truly understand how you worked past them. You have already come a way, even if you’re on day two. Understand that you are on a journey to better yourself inside and out. To understand that will allow you to see past the scale, or past the setback, or past a missed workout. Only when a missed workout becomes 2-3 missed workouts does it become a problem. So, understand where you’ve come from, how hard you’ve worked, and know that you do not want to start over. You do not want to be back here next year. You want to keep propelling forward, even if it means that you have to backtrack a few steps. Your journey is your journey alone and where you come from makes all the difference. Your path is yours alone and your purpose is only driven by you. Step 4- Give yourself credit This is likely the step I struggle the most with… I have a hard time giving myself credit. But, once I started, it became easier. You need to allow yourself to make mistakes. Motivation often comes from success propelling success, but what happens when you don’t feel successful? What happens when you feel like you’re failing? You quit.  But I’m here to say, don’t quit. Instead, you have to give yourself credit for every single moment you made the right choice. Every single time you killed your workout. Every single time you drove past the drive-thru. Every victory is victory. Remember how much you have done and how far you have come. You made this choice.  You and you alone. You decided that you wanted to be healthier and fitter. The choice that you made, even if you are struggling to stick with it, was a choice that was a good one. Give yourself the credit you deserve. Pat yourself on the back. Step 5- Stop making and allowing excuses to dictate your life Ouch. That one hurt. This probably should have been either number 1 or number 7. But I decided that this should be post number 5, just because. Here’s the thing: I’m queen of excuses. I have called myself on that in the past and I have always allowed excuses to get in my way. I have a thyroid disorder, I’m tired, I am in pain, I… I… I… But the reality is that excuses are the vehicle to your own pity party- and no one’s showing up to that. Trust me. In order to truly be motivated to change, you have to remind yourself that the reasons you are justifying your lack of drive are just excuses. I used to allow other’s judgement of me (or so I thought it was judgement, it was really me judging myself… but that’s for another day) to stop me from achieving what I wanted to do. I also used to allow my kids to be a crutch, my mood, my illness, my busy life, my husband… you name it, I’ve blamed it. But until we really become honest with ourselves (throw back to step 2, here) we will not really be able to make a lasting change. So, write down all of your excuses, cross them out, and put them where you will be reminded that they are getting in your way. Step 6- Surround yourself with people who get it Part of finding your mojo is finding the people who are mojoing with you. I know that’s not technically a word, but if you think about how you are affected by the people around you, you realize that your mood can often be altered with the positive vibes of a lifelong friend. The same can be said for the negative vibes of people in your life. It may not be possible to just stop talking to Aunt Irma or totally cut your boss out of your life, but you can effectively change your circle by adding more positive people who ‘get it’ to it. You could also sign someone on to ‘get it’ like your spouse or sister or dog. The point is that you have to have people around you that you can depend on; both good and bad days. You have to have people who want to hear your story, who want to help you motivate. Not people who tell you it’s okay to give up or that make you feel that you are not worthy of this change. There are many people who will tell you what you think you need to hear and not the truth, too. Those people mean well, but they can be dangerous. You need people who are willing to listen, help you reason through the feelings, This is why success partners, challenge groups, and social media are tremendously helpful when you are taking on any journey. Once you recruit the right people, you become a team, and you are unstoppable. Step 7- Choose a mantra based on your goals And say it over, and over, and over again. Mine, as of late, has been from Sommer Tucker: “Each choice you make will either lead your closer to or farther from your goals.” I know that’s a long one, but all I say to myself is “Closer or farther, Claire?” Sometimes out loud. (Reminder, this is about motivation, not about senility.) There are so many mantras you can pick, depending on your need for motivation. If it is motivation to keep you nutrition on point, find a quote by someone you admire and keep repeating it (like mine). If it’s to keep moving, maybe “Just keep swimming” (song and all) would be a perfect fit. If it’s to make a difficult choice, “Be the Change”. There are always mantras that can further your goals. By having a conversation with yourself, you are addressing the choice before you make it. You are calling yourself out before it’s too late. And much like finding your why and writing that down, identifying your goals is the ultimate motivator. By addressing what you want to do, how you plan to do it, and why you are going to do it is the first step. Finding mantras and putting them everywhere (think fridge, mirror, notebook, laptop, Facebook, etc.) right next to your whys, crossed out excuses, and goals will remind you when you have a hard time reminding yourself.   Motivation is the vehicle for your success and self love is the fuel. You find your determination when you realize why you need to make your change. And that will make you unstoppable.    Share this: Facebook Twitter Email Google Print Recommend this article Tweet About Claire Pelletier I'm 30. Boy am I 30.

Here's How Facebook Got Worked Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Donate Subscribe Search Newsletter Magazine Politics Environment Media Crime and Justice Food Guns Dark Money Photos Investigations Podcasts Kevin Drum About Subscribe Donate Skip to Navigation Skip to Content Politics Environment Food Media Crime & Justice Photos Investigations Magazine Subscribe Donate Here's How Facebook Got Worked Kevin DrumNov. 14, 2016 7:10 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email There are lots of wingnut sites that traffic in conspiracy theories and urban myths. But that's not all. There are also fake news sites, deliberately crafted to look real and fool people into believing outrageous stories. The most infamous at the moment is the Denver Guardian, which peddled a fake story written in pseudo-AP style about an FBI agent involved in investigating Hillary Clinton's emails who was found murdered. Sites like Google and Facebook should work harder to eliminate junk like this from their search results and news feeds, and in Facebook's case it turns out they have a pretty good idea of how to do it. But Gizmodo reports that they were afraid to pull the trigger: According to two sources with direct knowledge of the company’s decision-making, Facebook executives conducted a wide-ranging review of products and policies earlier this year, with the goal of eliminating any appearance of political bias. One source said high-ranking officials were briefed on a planned News Feed update that would have identified fake or hoax news stories, but disproportionately impacted right-wing news sites by downgrading or removing that content from people’s feeds. According to the source, the update was shelved and never released to the public. It’s unclear if the update had other deficiencies that caused it to be scrubbed. “They absolutely have the tools to shut down fake news,” said the source, who asked to remain anonymous citing fear of retribution from the company. The source added, “there was a lot of fear about upsetting conservatives after Trending Topics,” and that “a lot of product decisions got caught up in that.” This demonstrates the benefit of working the refs. Back in May, an ex-Facebook employee accused Facebook of manipulating its Trending Topics feed to favor liberal stories. Conservatives naturally went ballistic, and their shitstorm of abuse worked: Facebook caved in and agreed to change its process even though there was never any real evidence of liberal bias in the first place. That was a victory, but not the real victory. The real victory is that it put the fear of God into Facebook, which became hypersensitive to anything that might affect right-wing sites—even if those sites were plainly bogus. And as Mike Caulfield points out, bogus right-wing stories like the Denver Guardian's get a lot of attention on Facebook: To put this in perspective, if you combined the top stories from the Boston Globe, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, and LA Times, they still had only 5% the viewership of an article from a fake news site that intimated strongly that the Democratic Presidential candidate had had a husband and wife murdered then burned to cover up her crimes. Facebook probably could have stopped this kind of thing, but their earlier run-in over the Trending Topics feed made them afraid to do anything. That's how Facebook ended up promoting dozens of right-wing conspiracy theories during a presidential campaign. They had been worked. Get the scoop,  straight from Mother Jones.

THE FUTURE Here's What 150 Experts Say About the Future of Robotics A new paper advises the U.S. government on what's coming and where to invest. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Some of the top minds in the field have some advice for the next presidential administration on how to proceed with robotics. Last week, a group of 150 experts from Google, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, UPenn, Yale, Georgia Tech, and Carnegie Mellon (to name a few) published the latest edition of the Roadmap for Robotics, a report that outlines the industry's future. The 100-page paper is meant to serve as a guide to what sorts of developments the tech industry should strive for and what types of technologies Congress should invest in. The experts offer specific suggestions as to how the U.S. should allocate funds toward advancing robotics and lays out suggestions for regulation. For one, it suggests robotics companies be required to offer more transparency regarding the tasks that their machines can and cannot perform. The report specifically singles out robots meant for hospitals and other medical settings. "There have been several instances," the paper says, without naming names, "of companies grossly exaggerating a robot's capabilities, understating the required amount of training time clinicians need to become proficient at using a robot, and substantially overcharging rural hospitals for technology that does not actually benefit health care workers or patients." The paper cites delivery bots as an important area of development. Currently, Silicon Valley startup Savioke's Relay acts as a bellhop, making deliveries throughout hotels. London-based Starship Technologies manufactures bots that cruise down sidewalks and deliver food and parcels. The road map encourages the development of limbed robots that can deliver goods by climbing stairs, avoiding broken walkways, and negotiating crowded areas--much in the ways that humans do. "With such a solution," the authors say, "logistics will become fast, 24/7, on-demand, inexpensive, predictable, and well-tracked." Another key suggestion: Invest in robotics for use in the manufacturing industry that are highly intuitive and require little training. The authors warn that China, South Korea, Japan, and India are all spending more on technology education than the U.S.--allowing their manufacturing industries to grow at a faster rate as tech is easily integrated into their factories. Robotics can vastly increase the speed and efficiency with which goods are produced. A robot at Under Armour's new Baltimore facility, for instance, can produce sneakers at a rate 200 times faster than humans, while another can slice through 50 sheets of fabric at once while automatically cutting in the pattern that produces the least amount of waste. The authors also predict that autonomous vehicles will be safer and more predictable than human-driven vehicles within 15 years. To get there, they recommend "significant investment" in the various software and hardware--cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors--that make self-driving possible. The paper was partially sponsored by the National Science Foundation, a government agency that supports science and engineering research. The first edition of this paper, published in 2009, inspired the U.S. government to launch the National Robotics Initiative, a program that provided $70 million for robotics research, in 2011. While it's not yet known what President Trump's position will be when it comes to robotics--he hasn't yet addressed the issue directly--it's not hard to imagine that someone who promised to add jobs in the auto and manufacturing industries might be resistant to machines that automate a good chunk of those jobs.

Your phone's software updates may be to blame An iPhone 6 was one of the devices tested Credit: Getty Images James Titcomb 15 November 2016 • 12:01am Unsuspecting mobile phone owners may be left with flat batteries after they update their handsets, despite technology companies promising longer life and better performance from the new software. The consumer group Which? found that when iPhones or Android phones are updated to the latest version of their operating systems, their battery life can fall by as much as three hours. A two-year-old iPhone 6 lost 38 minutes of battery life when it was updated to the latest version of Apple’s iOS software, iOS 10. A Google Nexus 6P phone went from 12 to nine hours of battery life when the most recent version of Android was installed. The Nexus 6P also fared poorly Both the iPhone and Android software claim that features in the latest versions improve battery life, rather than hurting it. Mobile phone companies typically release major software updates every year as well as adding smaller changes throughout the year. When an update is released, users are sent notifications urging them to upgrade and are often given no way to revert to the previous operating system, meaning they are stuck with the new software even if they suffer from worse performance. Which? said that software updates can also mean the memory of tablets and phones falling dramatically due to the extra capacity taken up by more advanced software. A Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet lost 30 gigabytes of storage when upgrading to the latest version of Windows - enough for thousands of photos. The science behind how a battery works Play! 02:19 The updates often include new features and important security changes that protect users from being tracked or having their details stolen, but early versions can be loaded with bugs. Which? said mobile phone companies should do more to warn users of the side effects of updating, and allow them to revert to older software if they wish. The group did find that battery life and storage were improved in some cases. Updating an iPad Air to the latest software improved battery life by two hours and updating a Samsung Galaxy tablet improved it by four and a half hours. “Given how much we rely on mobile devices, companies should do more to tell us about the possible downsides of updates, as well as the benefits,” Which?’s Richard Headland said.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Market News | Mon Nov 14, 2016 | 3:59pm EST REFILE-U.S. internet firms ask Trump to support encryption, ease regulations (Refiles to make date of letter in second paragraph Monday and not Friday. No other changes to text) By Dustin Volz WASHINGTON Nov 14 U.S. internet companies including Facebook Inc and Amazon Inc have sent President-elect Donald Trump a detailed list of their policy priorities, which includes promoting strong encryption, immigration reform and maintaining liability protections from content that users share on their platforms. The letter sent on Monday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet's Google , Uber and Twitter, represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign. "The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue," reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, and seen by Reuters. Some of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump's priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict U.S. internet companies from growing in that market. Other goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign. They include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to U.S. government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally. The association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was "softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country." While urging support for trade agreements, the letter does not mention the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump has repeatedly assailed with claims it was poorly negotiated and would take jobs away from U.S. workers. The technology sector supported the deal, but members of Congress have conceded since the election it is not going to be enacted. Trump's often-shifting policy proposals on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and sometimes elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda. Trump has also urged a boycott of Apple Inc products over the company's refusal to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone associated with last year's San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon, and demanded that tech companies such as Apple manufacture their products in the United States.

Morgan – and panelists and participants will discuss global trends and best practices in workplace equality for LGBT employees. 150 participants from more than 100 Brazilian and multinational organizations will participate in the Forum, making it the largest event to take place on LGBT workplace equality in Brazil.  Panelists represent major corporations and organizations, including J.P. Morgan, Dow, Accenture, Ambev, Bloomberg, Microsoft, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Google, Goldman Sachs, Monsanto and Instituto Ethos. “I am so proud to be bringing together some of the largest corporations in Brazil and across the world to celebrate LGBT workplace equality and discuss how to make the workplace a better place for the LGBT community,” said Out & Equal CEO and Founder, Selisse Berry. “The huge response to this event illustrates the great interest in and commitment to workplace diversity and inclusion here in Brazil.” Research by the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles demonstrates that LGBT-supportive policies and workplace climates are linked to greater job commitment, improved workplace relationships and increased job satisfaction for LGBT employees. “There is a tremendous momentum in Brazil with respect to LGBT inclusion in the workplace, with many firms exploring how they can mobilize or take their efforts to the next level,” said Ken Jannsens, Board Member, Out & Equal and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan. “This event will bring together all that energy in one place for an entire afternoon so we can learn from each other and ensure that these 100 companies lead the way for all of corporate Brazil.” Short URL: http://lgbtweekly.com/?p=75397 Posted by Steve Lee, Editor on Nov 14, 2016.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | November 14, 2016 -- 19:57 GMT (11:57 PST) | Topic: Enterprise Software There have been stories recently that Munich, which has been using Linux for years, is considering switching to Windows 10. Who started these stories? Accenture, a Microsoft partner. Munich is the center of a PR struggle between the Linux and Windows desktops. Accenture, a professional services company, isn't just any old Microsoft partner. It's Microsoft's Alliance Partner of the Year in 2016. That makes the ninth year in a row and twelfth time overall that Microsoft global sales has recognized Accenture as Microsoft's top selling partner. Read this No, Microsoft, open source software really is cheaper, insists Munich Which is cheaper - using open source or Microsoft's software? The software giant and the city of Munich have come up with very different answers. Read More I am shocked -- shocked -- that Accenture thinks Windows 10 would be the better choice. Munich, Germany's third largest city, started switching to Linux and OpenOffice in 2003. The move of about 15,000 PCs was completed in 2013. Ever since day one of the shift, Microsoft has tried to bring Munch back into the Windows and Microsoft Office fold. As soon as the project was completed, Microsoft claimed the Linux/open-source project cost more than 60 million Euros. Windows XP and Office, Microsoft claimed, would have cost only 17 million Euros. This latest "news" is just Microsoft and buddies' latest public relations move. It's not that 15,000 PCs are that important to Accenture's or Microsoft's bottom line. They aren't. What is important is to discourage corporate and government buyers from seeing a Linux desktop success story. True, there may never be a year of the Linux desktop. LiMux, Munich's customized Ubuntu and OpenOffice desktop, is never going to be the most popular Linux in Germany, never mind the world. But Android is now the most popular end-user operating system of all. Worse still, if your business depends on selling Windows licenses, Google is merging Android and Chrome OS into one operating system. You may not see Android and Chrome OS as Linux success stories, but they are. More to the business point, Microsoft knows these are rivals to its Windows product line. Microsoft has already admitted that it won't make its self-imposed deadline of having Windows 10 installed on a billion devices by mid-2018. Will Accenture and Microsoft chase out Tux the plucky Linux penguin? It's hard to say. It's become a city-government political fight. Governments being what they are, a decision won't be made at the earliest until the summer of 2017. Roughly 15,000 PCs won't help Microsoft meet its new 2018 deadline for a billion Windows 10 PCs. But any prominent Linux desktop success story won't help them either. Microsoft has finally understood it must adopt Linux and open-source software on the cloud, but on the desktop, it's still Windows all the time.
