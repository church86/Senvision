Rachel Graf Oct 10, 2016 2:20 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Alphabet  (GOOGL) were gaining in mid-afternoon trading on Monday after Axiom increased its price target to $1,000 from $990 and reiterated a "buy" rating on the stock.  The Google parent company will likely exceed consensus estimates when it reports 2016 third quarter earnings on October 27, the firm wrote in a note cited by Barron's.  The fourth quarter should beat expectations as well, and 2017 should be strong due to search innovations and continued growth at its YouTube unit, Axiom noted. YouTube's strength should help offset a tough Google Websites comp from a year ago, when Google launched a third search link on mobile, the the firm stated.  Additionally, Wells Fargo believes that Google will continue to take share from "non-TV media," and could see an uptick in revenue from "non-advertising marketing services," TheFly reports. The firm reiterated an "outperform" rating on the stock. Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates the stock as a "buy" with a ratings score of A. Alphabet's strengths include its compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, solid stock price performance and reasonable valuation levels.  (Alphabet is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS.

 Following in the footsteps of Apple and Amazon, Google wants to put its new smart assistant inside cars Avery Hartmans Oct. 10, 2016, 11:12 AM 1,637 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the company's hardware event last week. AP Google's new Assistant is already enabled in its messaging app, its Amazon Echo-like Home device, and its new Pixel phone. Now, the company wants to put Google Assistant in vehicles, too.  The artificial intelligence-powered Assistant is similar to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa and gets smarter over time. It was first unveiled in Google's new messaging app, Allo, last month, powers Google Home, and comes standard on Google's new smartphone. According to the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims, Google is now pursuing partnerships with automakers to let the Assistant work directly with vehicles.  Google is following in the footsteps of other major tech companies who have partnered with carmakers to integrate their digital assistants. Apple's Siri works with GM vehicles — it was first launched in the Chevrolet Spark and Sonic in 2012 — and Ford announced at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show that it was partnering with Amazon to integrate its vehicles with Echo. While the Journal didn't say how the integration would work, the Ford-Echo partnership was designed to let you start your vehicle or tell you how much charge your electric car has without walking outside. There's no word yet on which automakers Google plans to partner with, but if it chooses the same route as its competitors and opts for an American automaker, Fiat Chrysler and Tesla are still up for grabs.  Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We expect our digital assistants to be smart, to set timers and organize schedules and provide answers to important questions. Like, does Bigfoot exist? Increasingly, our expectations for these assistants has become for them to act more human. For Google, that means giving its new Assistant technology a sense of humor. In a report from the Wall Street Journal, it’s revealed that Google hired writers from Pixar and the Onion in an effort to give Assistant personality. “Google wants to build an emotional connection with the user,” according to Gummi Hafsteinsson, product management director of Google Home. WSJ further expands on Hafsteinsson’s comments: Getting it right also requires paying attention to details such as latency—humans have no patience for it in conversation—and tone of voice, such as stressing the word “now,” when Assistant says, “Setting a timer for two minutes starting now.” Although assistants such as Siri and Alexa are becoming smarter, you’re very aware you’re talking to a robot with scripted responses. Google is trying to bridge the divide between human and AI by using humor as a way to create an emotional connection. Think of the movie Her as an example of what Google is hoping to achieve. Why a smarter Google Assistant matters… Google’s Assistant technology is at the core of the search giant’s software and hardware ambitions, which is why it’s important to create something that people can form a connection with. Assistant is crucial to both Google Home and its new Pixel smartphone, and it’s also available in Allo, the company’s new mobile messaging app. Source WSJ Topics #Google #Google Assistant Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Just recently, Google joined the competition with its Pixel XL handset. After going head to head with Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, it’s about time for the Android device to be pitted against another formidable Android phablet, LG’s V20. LG’s V10 successor debuted to good reviews with its stellar specs and features. Let’s find out if the Pixel XL is worthy of being called a V20 rival. Performance As flagship devices, performance is expected to be top-notch for these two. The LG V20 is equipped with a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor (two Kryo cores clocked at 2.15 GHZ and the other two Kryo cores clocked at 1.6 GHz), 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU. By today’s standards, these specs are guaranteed to deliver high quality performance. However, Google may have the upper hand at this point, since its Pixel XL is powered by Qualcomm’s latest quad-core Snapdragon 821 chip (two Kryo cores clocked at 2.15 GHz and two more clocked at 1.6 GHz), 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU. Despite having very similar specifications, Qualcomm indicated on its website that the 821 chip is 10 percent better than the 820. This may not translate to a significant difference between the real time performance of the two devices, but Google’s phablet is known to provide a more seamless user experience than LG’s dual-screen phablet on paper.   Display When it comes to display, both handsets are rocking large touchscreen screens with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection. The V10 successor has a 5.7-inch IPS LCD display with 1440 x 2560 screen resolution and 513 ppi pixel density. On the other hand, Google’s Pixel XL comes with a smaller 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with 1440 x 2560 screen resolution and 534 ppi pixel density. Although the screen sizes and pixel densities of the two are dissimilar, both handsets render colors very well. Thus, there isn’t much difference in the display quality they project to the naked eye. The thing that makes the V20 stand out, however, is the inclusion of a secondary screen atop its primary display. Keeping the distinguishing feature found on its predecessor, the V20 also has a small 2.1-inch horizontal display that is dedicated solely for notifications, shortcuts and other app-specific features. This then ensures that the main screen’s real estate is optimally utilized for the primary user experience.  Camera Technology In this day and age, smartphone users are opting to buy devices that can match their instant photography needs. For this very reason, it’s clear that the V20 takes the cake when it comes to camera technology. LG’s handset is boasting a dual rear camera setup comprising a standard lens with a 16-megapixel lens and a wide angle lens with an 8-megapixel lens. The two lenses make up for a photography device that is comparable to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus dual-lens camera. Enhancing the user experience of the V20’s primary camera setup are the laser and phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, optical image stabilization and dual-LED flash. On the other hand, the Pixel XL’s camera is  a single lens with a 12-megapixel sensor, laser and phase detection autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. If it’s any consolation, the Pixel XL is armed with an 8-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, while the V20 only comes with a 5-megapixel front snapper.  Related Stories Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs. Google Pixel XL — Which Is The Better Phablet? Apple iPhone 7 vs. Google Pixel - Which Is Better? iPhone 7 Plus vs. LG V20: Comparison Of Camera Technology Miscellaneous Other determining factors that could help consumers decide include the batteries, OS versions, onboard memory variants and other features. Google’s all-new phablet is powered by a non-removable Li-ion 3,450 mAh battery, while LG’s device houses a removable Li-ion 3,200 mAh battery. Android OS-wise, the LG V20 is considered the device that was the first to come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Contrariwise, the Pixel XL is running the latest version of the Nougat OS, v7.1, and certain software features that are only Pixel-exclusive. Both handsets have fingerprint scanners. The Pixel XL comes in two internal memory options, 32 GB and 128 GB, without the advantage of having expandable memory via a microSD card slot. On the other hand, the V20 comes in 32 GB and 64 GB variants and it has a dedicated microSD card slot that can accommodate up to 256 GB of additional storage. The Pixel XL has Very Black, Really Blue and Quite Silver color options, whereas the V20 has Titan, Silver and Pink color variants to choose from. Finally, what sets the V20 apart from the Pixel XL and other phablets in the industry is its B&O Play certified 3.5mm headphone jack and its 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC technology and built-in HD Audio Recorder for unparalleled audio capabilities.  Which do you think is the better phablet between Google’s Pixel XL and LG’s V20?

By Chris Duckett | October 10, 2016 -- 23:33 GMT (16:33 PDT) | Topic: Legal The European Union regulator investigating whether Alphabet unit Google is abusing its market power has not extended its scrutiny to the tech giant's tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the bloc's antitrust chief has said. Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple to pay up to €13 billion in back taxes to Ireland, and Starbucks up to €30 million to the Dutch tax office, said Google is not on her radar for now. What's Hot on ZDNet Edward Snowden: Don't fear Trump, fear the surveillance state Why MacBook Pros don't need 32GB of RAM Windows 10 supremacy? Eve V comes gunning for Microsoft's mighty Surface Pro 4 How Linux can save small businesses (and old hardware) "So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one," Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party, which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google's £130 million back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticised as a derisory amount. Vestager also defended the slow pace of the commission's antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010, when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday. "But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." Vestager said she does not know when she will issue a decision, but said the case is a very high priority for her. In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favouring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results. In May, reports suggested Google faced a fine in the order of €3 billion from the European Commission following three failed attempts to compromise with the tech giant over the six-year period of the investigation. The commission can fine firms up to 10 percent of their annual sales, which in Google's case would be a maximum possible sanction of more than €6 billion. The biggest antitrust fine to date was a €1.1 billion fine imposed on chip-maker Intel in 2009. Google has also been charged with blocking rivals in online search advertising and doing the same with dominant Android mobile operating system. In April, the commission delivered its preliminary view on the matter, stating that Google has abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on Android device manufacturers and network operators. "Based on our investigation thus far, we believe that Google's behaviour denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players, in breach of EU antitrust rules," Vestager said at the time. This follows the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) making a similar ruling in March against a Google appeal. Russia has stepped up its rhetoric against US software firms, drafting a new law requiring Russian government agencies to give preference to open source and to block US software from computer systems, citing security concerns. Google's Paris office was raided in May as part of the French government seeking €1.6 billion in back taxes. "The investigation aims to verify whether Google Ireland Ltd has a permanent base in France and if, by not declaring parts of its activities carried out in France, it failed its fiscal obligations, including on corporate tax and value added tax," the prosecutor's office said at the time. Google has based its regional headquarters in Dublin, where corporate tax rates are lower than elsewhere in Europe.

WIBBITZ In this Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016, file photo, a Samsung Galaxy S7, left, and S7 Edge are displayed during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2016 event on the eve of the Mobile World Congress wireless show, in Barcelona, Spain. (Photo: AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) At this point, one thing about the Galaxy Note 7 is very clear: Samsung's latest smartphone is unsafe. After a week of reports that replacement Note 7 phones were catching on fire from battery issues, Samsung is stopping production and asking all global retail partners to stop sales and exchanges for replacement Note 7s. If you have one, return the phone to your carrier or retailer for an alternate phone. USA TODAY Samsung adjusting Galaxy Note 7 production after fires But what should you get instead? Here are a few replacements worth considering. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge If you really love your Note 7's water resistance, great camera, wireless charging and crisp display, you should strongly consider the Galaxy S7 Edge ($749.99-$800). Samsung's top Galaxy S7 phone has a slightly smaller screen and lacks some of the Note 7's bells and whistles, namely the USB-C port, iris scanner and stylus support, but is as close as you'll find to the Note 7. It's an excellent phone, and unlike the Note 7, there have been hardly any reports of exploding battery issues. It is also cheaper than the Note 7, so you should get some money back from your carrier, too. REVIEWED The Best Android Smartphones of 2016 - Reviewed.com Smartphones Apple iPhone 7 Plus The new Apple iPhone 7 does not include a headphone jack.  (Photo: Richard Vogel, AP) If you're done with Samsung and want to switch, the iPhone 7 Plus ($769) is an enticing option. It has a large 5.5-inch display, improved camera and finally offers water resistance. It's not the perfect Note 7 replacement -- the battery does not last as long, the display is not as sharp and the water resistance on the Note is better than the iPhone. Oh, and there's no headphone jack. But it is the best iPhone on the market and a compelling alternative. Apple also has a free Android to iPhone app in the Google Play store called "Move to iOS" to help make the switching process easier. Google Pixel XL Google's new Pixel comes in a variety of sizes and colors.  (Photo: Google) If you have another phone you can use for a little bit, the Google Pixel XL ($769) may be the phone for you. Google's first smartphone will be out October 20, and like the other phones on this list, it has a 5.5-inch display, fast charging battery that promises nearly 7 hours of charge in 15 minutes, and unlimited storage for photos and videos on Google Photos. It runs the latest version of Android, version 7.1 Nougat, and even supports Google's new Daydream virtual reality platform, giving you a replacement for Samsung's Gear VR. Unlike the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7 Plus, the Pixel XL will be exclusive to Verizon. An unlocked option will be available from Google that works on the other major carriers, but according to Google's site, it is either out of stock or on a 5-6 week backorder. LG V20 LG V20  (Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY) For those looking for an Android phone not made by Samsung, and can't wait for the Pixel, the LG V20 ($830 at AT&T) is a strong contender. It's 5.7-inch high resolution display matches the Note 7 and also features a speedy processor and dual cameras for improved pictures. It's not water resistant like the Note 7, but it does feature a replaceable battery, a rarity amongst high-end phones that still is appreciated. As with the Pixel, you're going to need to use a different phone for the time being. The LG V20 hits T-Mobile and Sprint on October 28 and will come to AT&T and Verizon, though a release date has yet to be announced. These are just a few of the many great phones available, including strong contenders from HTC, OnePlus and Huawei. Regardless of what phone you get, you should back up and return your Note 7 as soon as you can.

A piece this morning from The Wall Street Journal mentioned how Google and other companies working on intelligent voice assistants — like Amazon — are trying their best to make them as relatable and human-friendly as possible, and one tidbit reveals that Google has even gone as far as to hire writers from Pixar and The Onion to make that a reality… Per the story: To infuse personality into Assistant, Google employs writers who have worked on movies at Pixar and crafted jokes for the Onion, says Gummi Hafsteinsson, product-management director of Google Home. If they’re hiring writers from Pixar or The Onion, I’m still a bit confused why they haven’t given Assistant a proper human name like Siri or Alexa. I guess Google wants you to talk to all of its products as if they’re the replacement for the search box of old, so perhaps that’s part of what is keeping Google attached to the “OK, Google” hotword and the new “Assistant” name. It’s just odd that, at the same time, Google wants Assistant to be personable. We were on the ground at Google’s October 4th event earlier this month, and got a chance to try out Google Home for ourselves for the first time. It’s a nifty little device and definitely worth the price, but ultimately, it’s just an extension of the Google helper you’ve come to know and love in the form of a standalone always-listening device with an attached speaker. Personally, that’s something I’ve wanted for a long time. What do you think?

Archives director Lois Yorke says most recipes in the What’s Cooking? Food, Drink and the Pleasures of Eating in Old-Time Nova Scotia exhibit were found in the collections of private individuals.” The government of Hawaii has released a new digital archive for Kahoolawe. “The Hawaii government agency in charge of Kahoolawe, a former Navy bombing practice island off of Maui, has released a new online database of photos and documents illustrating the island and its archaeological artifacts.” Now available: a database of prehistoric human teeth. “Archaeologists have created a new database from the teeth of prehistoric humans found at ancient burial sites in Britain and Ireland that tell us a lot about their climate, their diet and even how far they may have travelled. In a paper, led by Dr Maura Pellegrini from the University of Oxford, researchers say that individuals in prehistoric Britain were highly mobile.” It looks like the data are within the paper, not clear if it’s available as a separate download / standalone thing. TWEAKS AND UPDATES The Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library and Museums has revamped its Web site (sounds like it’s been adding new content, too.) “The site includes the Hayes’ museum’s obituary index, the ability to search through the museum’s 90,000 books, manuscripts and images of the president and his family and educational programs and resources. [Kristina] Smith said site visitors can browse through the museum’s manuscript collections online, search the diaries and letters of President Hayes and look at political cartoons from the Gilded Age.” Google is promising the next iteration of Chrome won’t be such a memory hog. “The Chrome team working on V8, the part of the browser that runs the JavaScript programs that make websites tick, “significantly reduced the memory footprint” of websites like Imgur, Reddit, Twitter and The New York Times. The changes come in Chrome 55, due in December.” I have a 2GB Chromebox and a 4GB Chromebox. The 4GB is fine but the 2GB is getting tougher and tougher to use… USEFUL STUFF VERY cool! Stolen from Paul P – thanks Paul! How To Make a Map From Open Data Using a Spreadsheet. “There’s been an explosion of open data made available by all levels government, but much of it is still in a pretty raw form and can be hard to manipulate and visualize. However, Google Sheets provides some powerful data import functions that can automatically populate a spreadsheet from a data feed, and Geosheets adds mapping and geospatial functions to Google Sheets. So the two combined can allow you to make a map from open data very quickly and without downloading anything.” Google Scholar wonks, you’ll like this: Scraping Google Scholar to write your PhD literature chapter. “This post is about a prototype ‘network’ approach to finding papers using data from Google Scholar, hopefully pointing to what could be done with more open data. I was able to use a supervised program searching on Google Scholar to extract my data, but a scalable version of this tool would require open data.” AROUND THE SEARCH AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD Oh argh: YouTube recently did a content takedown worthy of Facebook. “There was reason to celebrate last week: the European Parliament adopted my report to update the EU’s export control laws for goods that are used for torture and the death penalty. I uploaded a series of videos on YouTube of the debate in the Parliament… Three hours later I found a notice in my inbox, which explained that one of the video’s in this playlist had been taken down.” Apparently Verizon wants to knock $1B off its purchase price for Yahoo after news of the hacking scandal surfaced. That’s a little over 20% the original price. “Yahoo is telling Verizon that a deal is a deal and that the telecom giant has no legal avenue to change the terms. Yahoo’s next board meeting is in two weeks but the two parties are continuing discussions.” SECURITY/LEGAL ISSUES Techdirt: Senator Ron Wyden Says White House Is Required By Law To Reveal Details Behind Yahoo Scanning. “So, one of the things in the USA Freedom Act is a provision requiring that the White House declassify any ‘novel interpretations’ of the law in ordering surveillance. This was to avoid the situations, such as under the Section 215 program, where the intelligence community reads words to mean things differently than anyone else would read them. Now, given what we’ve learned so far about the Yahoo email scanning case and the fact that it clearly goes beyond what people thought the law enabled, it seems clear that there’s some interpretation somewhere that’s ‘novel.'” In fact, the Yahoo scanning scandal is having international repercussions. “Yahoo’s decision to scan clients’ email accounts at the behest of US authorities has prompted questions in Europe as to whether EU citizens’ data had been compromised, and could help derail a new trans-Atlantic data sharing deal.” RESEARCH AND OPINION Oh, thank goodness, because I might be doomed: Social media won’t affect your ability to concentrate: Study “New York: Frequent use of online social media does not lead to long-term problems with your ability to concentrate, says a new study. These modern communication tools do not, it seems, interfere with our primal instincts, such as long-term attitudes, time appreciation, and concentration, in the way that many critics have suggested in recent years, said the study published in the International Journal Social Media and Interactive Learning Environments.” Good morning, Internet… Do you like ResearchBuzz?

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 10, 2016 at 5:27PM $3,000 might not seem like enough to invest in the stock market. Many financial advisors would likely tell you to invest that amount in a low-cost index fund instead of buying shares of a single stock. However, $3,000 can blossom into over $120,000 faster than you might think. Let's take a look at two Chinese stocks -- Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP) -- that accomplished that in just over a decade. Image source: Getty Images. Baidu Baidu, the biggest search engine in China, went public at $27 per share in 2005. $3,000 would have been enough to buy 111 shares. After the stock's 10-for-1 split in 2010, you would have 1,110 shares -- which would be worth nearly $200,000 today. In hindsight, it seems like a no-brainer to invest in "China's Google." After all, the country already has more than 720 million internet users, which is more than double the U.S. population and accounts for about a fifth of the world's internet users. But at the time of its IPO, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google was still active in China, and the bears doubted Baidu's ability to compete against the search behemoth. That all changed in 2010, when Google shut down its Chinese search engine after clashes with the government over censorship and allegations of email hacking. Baidu filled the void, became the dominant search engine, and built a Google-like ecosystem of websites and cloud-based apps to widen its moat. Baidu's annual revenue soared from $2.3 billion in 2011 to $10.2 billion in 2015. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with 9% growth this year and 22% growth in 2017. Baidu's earnings are expected to fall 18% this year due to higher investments in O2O (online-to-offline) services -- such as ride-hailing, food deliveries, mobile payments, and other services integrated into its mobile app -- but once those investments become accretive, Baidu's earnings are expected to rebound 53% next year. Ctrip.com Ctrip, the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China, went public in 2003 at $18 per share. $3,000 would have been enough to buy 167 shares. Following four 2:1 splits, you would own 2,672 shares, which would be worth nearly $126,000 today. Image source: Getty Images. Ctrip's growth was supported by a massive growth market: the newly affluent Chinese traveler. Total revenues of China's OTA market soared 46% annually to $1.05 billion in the second quarter of 2016, according to iResearch. That rapid growth is mirrored in Ctrip's revenue, which rose 48% in 2015. That growth looks robust, but Ctrip's earnings growth was volatile over the past few years due to aggressive pricing wars with rivals like Qunar (NASDAQ:QUNR). But last year, Baidu swapped its 25% stake in Qunar with Ctrip, making Ctrip a major investor in Qunar. That move, which strengthens Baidu's aforementioned O2O efforts, makes it pointless for Ctrip and Qunar to undercut each other's prices. Qunar is also expected to pivot toward smaller "tier 3 and 4" cities as Ctrip continues serving "tier 1 and 2" cities. The addition of the Qunar stake is expected to boost Ctrip's revenue by 76% this year, followed by 36% growth in 2017. The company is also expected to return to profitability next year after recording a net loss this year. With the competition now fading, Ctrip is well-poised to assert its dominance and widen its moat with new services. The key takeaway It takes lots of research and luck to find fast growers like Baidu and Ctrip, which both had to be held through very volatile times to book today's gains. But finding and holding these multibagger stocks can generate massive gains, in these cases turning investments of $3,000 into enough cash to buy a home.

A 12-year-old in Spain reportedly made an expensive mistake, racking up a $112,000 bill when he apparently confused Google's AdWords and AdSense platforms while trying to promote his band. Google logo NurPhoto via Getty Images file José Javier, who is a trumpet player in a band called Los Salerosos, was hit with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google after he signed up for AdWords instead of AdSense, according to Spain's El Pais. Related: Everything Google Announced At Its Jam-Packed Event Javier apparently signed up for AdWords, thinking he would make money when people clicked on his advertisement. However, the service actually charges the account holder every time someone clicks on their advertisement. The service Javier was looking for, AdSense, allows people to make money from advertisements on their page. That amount would take a lot of allowance money to pay off, but thankfully for Javier, Google was forgiving and cancelled the bill. While it's a big mistake, it's one Google recognizes. "We have looked into this case," the company told NBC News in a statement. "We have not received any monies from this user and we are canceling the outstanding AdWords balance." It's worth noting Google also has a page explaining the difference between AdWords and AdSense.

The improvements come with Chrome 55 which is scheduled for December this year. The Chrome team that works on Google’s Javascript engine (V8) writes in a blogpost that websites using a lot of Javascript will consume a lot less RAM memory. As an example the Chrome team mentions websites such as Reddit, Twitter, Youtube and Imgur. In Chrome 54 these websites consume a relative large amount of memory which can cause a slow browsing experience on cheap PCs and laptops. Google claims that the improvements in Chrome 55 will provide a smoother user experience and components like ‘heap memory’ consume 50% less memory on average and ‘zone memory’ consumes less than 40%. Google also announced it’s working on optimizing Chrome for devices with less than 1GB of RAM.

I don't use Chrome (Google dropped support for 32-bit GNU/Linux systems. Also, I don't trust Google.), but I do occasionally need Chromium for certain websites. Everytime I launch Chromium, I go through my system's processes to kill whatever I can, since that's the only way I'll be able to run Chromium on only 2GB or RAM. It seems quite rare to me for commercial software developers to attempt to reduce the consumption of RAM. Rather, I typically see them increase the RAM consumption because they can. All we need now is for developers of other browsers to take notice. Although Firefox doesn't use too much RAM (compared to current versions of Chromium), I'm still not happy with what it does consume. 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

Volokh finds a series of unusual court cases that resulted in web pages being de-indexed by Google, making them unavailable to search or other services. In some cases, reputation management firms were apparently charging as much as $6,000 a month for the service. Google will generally de-index pages if it receives a credible report that the page contains pirated content or defamatory statements. The reports are available in a public archive, and the vast majority of them concern pirated content. The standard for a successful request can be somewhat complex, but a legal injunction against the offending party is typically sufficient to de-index a site, making it effectively invisible to Google searches. $6,000 a month to make a page disappear from Google Volokh seems to have uncovered a way of gaming that system, giving bad actors the power to de-index any site they want. In the cases he describes, plaintiffs file lawsuits against dummy defendants who immediately agree to the proposed injunctions against them. The cases never see trial, and in many cases, the defendants themselves seem not to exist — but they exist long enough to get a court-approved injunction that can be sent to Google to de-index the site. Volokh’s investigation turned up 25 different instances of the scam in roughly the past year, although none of the named defendants could be located. In once case, a firm was able to de-index a news article by filing an injunction against an offending statement in the comments section, thus pulling the entire page off Google’s index. The phony claims represent a small percentage of the overall notices, as it’s common for Google to receive well over 100 copyright takedowns in a single day. Still they suggest that some reputation management firms have become adept at gaming Google’s system, and the company may need to devote more resources to examining apparently legal injunctions. It also suggests the law shouldn’t place any unnecessary legal weight on the takedown notices, as some cases are currently threatening to do. "The questionable nature of many such injunctions is reason to further insist that platforms not be legally bound by them," Volokh concludes.

There are multiple ways to specify colors that work better with one application or another, and so converting between them can be yet another tedious step in the design process. Fortunately, Google Search has once again come to the rescue, offering an easy way to convert colors between various kinds of color values. A number of color values are used in various applications. RGB and CMYK are used in print, while hex is used primarily in web design. With RGB, each of the primary colors — red, green, and blue — has a value within a range of 0-255. The higher the number, the more of that primary color is present in the color being defined. Pure red would be listed as RGB (255, 0, 0). Pure black would have no primary colors, and so RBG (0, 0, 0,), and white would be all primary colors, or RGB (255, 255, 255). CMYK functions similarly to RGB except the color ranges define cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black). Related: Google’s Play Store gets a major makeover Hex, on the other hand, is preferred by programmers because the color value is contained in one string and so is easier to copy and paste throughout code. Like RGB and CMYK, hex assigns a value to each primary color using a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal value. It’s a bit more complicated than RGB, in that the range runs from 00 to FF in hexadecimal notation, but suffice it to say that each hex value can map directly to an RGB value. In hex, pure red is represented as #ff0000, pure black as #000000, and pure white as #ffffff. If all of that’s confusing to you, then you’ll be particularly glad to see Google’s new tool. Basically, the tool lets you select a color and easily convert a color between the various color types. Type a color value into the Google search box, and you’ll be presented with a color chart representing the relevant color. Click on “Show Color Values,” and you’ll get a list of various color values to choose from. Sometimes, it’s the little things that can make a person’s life that much easier. In this case, Google isn’t changing the world with the introduction of a new tool or piece of technology, but they’re making one nuisance–converting between color values–a lot easier for people who do this kind of thing on a regular basis.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 10, 2016 at 5:27PM $3,000 might not seem like enough to invest in the stock market. Many financial advisors would likely tell you to invest that amount in a low-cost index fund instead of buying shares of a single stock. However, $3,000 can blossom into over $120,000 faster than you might think. Let's take a look at two Chinese stocks -- Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP) -- that accomplished that in just over a decade. Image source: Getty Images. Baidu Baidu, the biggest search engine in China, went public at $27 per share in 2005. $3,000 would have been enough to buy 111 shares. After the stock's 10-for-1 split in 2010, you would have 1,110 shares -- which would be worth nearly $200,000 today. In hindsight, it seems like a no-brainer to invest in "China's Google." After all, the country already has more than 720 million internet users, which is more than double the U.S. population and accounts for about a fifth of the world's internet users. But at the time of its IPO, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google was still active in China, and the bears doubted Baidu's ability to compete against the search behemoth. That all changed in 2010, when Google shut down its Chinese search engine after clashes with the government over censorship and allegations of email hacking. Baidu filled the void, became the dominant search engine, and built a Google-like ecosystem of websites and cloud-based apps to widen its moat. Baidu's annual revenue soared from $2.3 billion in 2011 to $10.2 billion in 2015. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with 9% growth this year and 22% growth in 2017. Baidu's earnings are expected to fall 18% this year due to higher investments in O2O (online-to-offline) services -- such as ride-hailing, food deliveries, mobile payments, and other services integrated into its mobile app -- but once those investments become accretive, Baidu's earnings are expected to rebound 53% next year. Ctrip.com Ctrip, the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China, went public in 2003 at $18 per share. $3,000 would have been enough to buy 167 shares. Following four 2:1 splits, you would own 2,672 shares, which would be worth nearly $126,000 today. Image source: Getty Images. Ctrip's growth was supported by a massive growth market: the newly affluent Chinese traveler. Total revenues of China's OTA market soared 46% annually to $1.05 billion in the second quarter of 2016, according to iResearch. That rapid growth is mirrored in Ctrip's revenue, which rose 48% in 2015. That growth looks robust, but Ctrip's earnings growth was volatile over the past few years due to aggressive pricing wars with rivals like Qunar (NASDAQ:QUNR). But last year, Baidu swapped its 25% stake in Qunar with Ctrip, making Ctrip a major investor in Qunar. That move, which strengthens Baidu's aforementioned O2O efforts, makes it pointless for Ctrip and Qunar to undercut each other's prices. Qunar is also expected to pivot toward smaller "tier 3 and 4" cities as Ctrip continues serving "tier 1 and 2" cities. The addition of the Qunar stake is expected to boost Ctrip's revenue by 76% this year, followed by 36% growth in 2017. The company is also expected to return to profitability next year after recording a net loss this year. With the competition now fading, Ctrip is well-poised to assert its dominance and widen its moat with new services. The key takeaway It takes lots of research and luck to find fast growers like Baidu and Ctrip, which both had to be held through very volatile times to book today's gains. But finding and holding these multibagger stocks can generate massive gains, in these cases turning investments of $3,000 into enough cash to buy a home.

This week, the Cut explores the allure of trying to achieve the impossible. According to Google, these are the top-ten searches for “How to get perfect _____.” How to get perfect skin How to get perfect eyebrows How to get the perfect body How to get perfect teeth How to get perfect curls How to get perfect hair How to get the perfect tan How to get the perfect butt How to get the perfect messy bun How to get the perfect abs I can’t say I’m surprised they all focus on physical improvements. As an SEO editor — an expert on how people search for things on Google — I frequently come across shocking, interesting, thought-provoking nuggets of information. When I set about researching women and how they think about perfection for the Cut, my experience was no different. The first search term, “how to get perfect skin,” yields 23.5 million articles. That’s almost as many as you get from searching “Kendall Jenner.” It’s three times as many results for “boosting confidence,” 16 times more than “maternity leave policies”, and nearly ten times as many as “how to stop living paycheck to paycheck.” On any given day, hundreds of thousands of women are reading about the latest Kardashian drama while also learning the right way to exfoliate (but only 538 are searching for “how to ask for a raise”). What does this say about women and how we view perfection? We’re constantly bombarded with stories about beautiful women with perfect everything, and often, those same women are sharing the nearly impossible steps they take to look that way. So, we read an article about Kendall Jenner, and then 18,000 of us Google how we can get her shiny hair. The flip side to searching for tips on how to achieve perfection is that thousands of women a day are also searching for inspiration about not being perfect. Whether looking for quotes about imperfections (14,800), songs about imperfections (4,400, but One Direction’s song “Perfect” gets over 200,000 searches), or personal essays about the struggle of being a perfectionist (40,000), we want to be reassured about our faults just as much as we want to correct them. Hence, “authenticity” and “vulnerability” are the top related search terms people also use when Googling “imperfect.” The association between searching “vulnerability” and “imperfect” is considered a “breakout,” meaning that search volume has increased by over 5,000 percent in the past year. Perhaps this is because when women are seeking reassurance about their flaws, they feel imperfections make them vulnerable and authentic, which are typically considered positive qualities. And topics related to insecurity — like “overcoming insecurity,” “how to stop being so insecure,” and “signs of insecurity” — garner nearly 10,000 searches every day. Nothing illustrates the push and pull of perfection online like Alicia Keys and her recent decision to forgo makeup at prominent events like the VMAs, the Democratic National Convention, and the BET Awards. Over the past six months, searches for her “no makeup movement” have increased by over 5,000 percent. She might not have the perfect skin (although it looks pretty beautiful to me), but she did tap into something in the Zeitgeist: Alicia Keys has nearly tripled her search traffic since June (where she appeared on the red carpet with no makeup for the first time), gathering interest from over 800,000 people per month. Maybe she knows it’s working, because she’s sticking to the no-makeup look — in the Voice premiere, she looked au naturel, freckles and all, and she recently appeared on the cover of Time Out New York makeup-free. Been working on being myself instead of other people’s idea of “perfect"! I’m feelin 💪🏽 and my best yet! https://t.co/eW5nrWKNrO— Alicia Keys (@aliciakeys) May 31, 2016 My high-school boyfriend once told me that my nose looked like a strawberry. I responded by telling him that was probably the meanest thing he’d ever said to me; I’ve always been self-conscious about my skin. I can’t remember how long it took after he told me my pores looked “like seeds” (he was charming) for me to want to correct my nose. By my last count, I have probably Googled “best pore minimizer” and “how to tell if you have rosacea,” at least 20 times, and those searches alone yielded 2.05 million pieces of reading material. Google holds up a magnifying mirror to our insecurities. We’re prone to searching for whatever we view in ourselves as imperfect, and we’re not afraid of specifics. It’s not just about “how to get perfect skin” — it’s also about “how to get smaller pores” and “how to get rid of acne.” And it doesn’t stop at “how to get a perfect body” — women then want to know “how to get thinner thighs” and “how to get rid of love handles.” Take this to a masochistic level and you get 1,600 people searching for “perfect body measurements.” There’s another explanation for all the searches about looking perfect, but it’s a bummer. Nearly 60,000 people search for “perfect girls” every day. What you get when you search those terms is porn. How many people search for “perfect guys” each day? A total of 12. In the whole world. Out of curiosity (or a need to find something positive amidst this negativity), I Googled “women search trends on Google.” I was hoping to find some credible articles on what women want to know from the internet, aside from things about perfection and looks. On the first page of Google (prime real estate), I found one story on how women spend more time on Google than men (but only in India), links to two shopping sites (Shopbop and Nordstrom), and four articles on fashion and hair trends. Then I tried another route: “What do women search for on the internet?” Some more international studies (from Nigeria this time) showed up, plus an article on the top-ten things women look for in a dating profile (cool), and a few articles that actually addressed what I was looking for, but they’re from 2005 and 2010 (ancient in internet-time). Maybe research outlets don’t think women’s search trends is an interesting topic, or perhaps Google thinks that fashion and dating are the most important things women search for online. But considering topics on “women empowerment” see nearly 21,000 searches daily, I’d say there are more things we care about besides fashion and beauty. Now if we could only stop Googling “how to get perfect skin.” Tags: googleseoperfect 10alicia keys Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top StoriesDonald Trump Hints at the Future of Abortion In AmericaThe History Teacher Who Sings About the Election With His StudentsThe Nonprofit Worker Navigating Sex and Dating During Election Week Most Viewed Stories Hillary Clinton Didn’t Shatter the Glass Ceiling.

Turkey Blocks Dropbox, OneDrive & Google Drive to Hide Recent RedHack Data Dump GO Turkey adds GitHub to the ban list, removes Google Drive Oct 10, 2016 21:35 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Turkey has blocked access to Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and GitHub in order to prevent its citizens from accessing a series of controversial files dumped online by the RedHack hacking crew. The block was put in motion on Saturday, October 8, and initially targeted Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive. Officials removed Google Drive from the list today after Google complied with a takedown notice from the government and removed the RedHack data from their servers. GitHub added to the blocklist today A few hours later, officials added GitHub to the list, after users uploaded the data on the source code hosting service in an attempt to avoid the local ban on cloud-based file sharing services. TurkeyBlocks, a service which keeps track of websites blocked in the country, says that Twitter has been intermittently inaccessible throughout Turkey over the weekend. According to several reports, in late September, RedHack, a hacking crew with a prodigious hacking history and ties to Turkey's communist political movement, had dumped online 20 GB of data. Turkey trying to hide AKP Twitter troll army? The group claims to have stolen the data from three email accounts belonging to Turkey’s Energy Minister, Berat Albayrak, who is also the son-in-law of the country's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to reports from Turkish journalists, the data dump contained details about a so-called "Twitter troll army," made up of AKP party members who viciously attacked anyone criticizing the country's president and the Turkish government, who has been contested in recent years following mass street protests. In July, during a failed military coup, Turkey also blocked access to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. In 2014, Turkey blocked Twitter and YouTube after someone leaked an audio recording of President Erdogan, then only a Prime Minister, instructing his son to get rid of a large sum of money after police started investigating their family on corruption charges. #Turkey#RedHack#Erdogan#data dump#AKP subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news EU Comes Down on Exports of Cyber-Surveillance Tech Swiss Vote to Give Their Government More Spying Powers German Military Hacked Afghan Mobile Operator to Discover Hostage's Whereabouts German Politicians Targeted with Spyware over the Summer Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android    Turkey blocks a suite of cloud-based file sharing services Related Apps TrustPort Tools: Encrypt sensitive data, clean temporary files, permanently delete activity traces, and create secure archives of your documents with this software suite Free Firewall: Protects your computer against all kinds of threats, preventing suspicious applications from accessing the Internet and sending data back home KCleaner: Find and remove unused files to free up space such as web browser cache or Windows installer files, optionally shred data, schedule automatic tasks, and set the PC to shut down afterward Cryptomator: Keep your cloud-stored files as safe as possible with the help of this platform-independent and user-friendly encryption application VPN Gate Client Plug-in: A plugin for SoftEther VPN whose main purpose is to easily hide your online identity via a network of relay proxy servers that conceal your IP address Prevent Restore: Take privacy protecting to the extreme by making deleted files unrecoverable with the help of this streamlined and easy to use tool Tom's FileZilla Password Recovery: A password recovery tool for the Filezilla FTP client that aims to come to the rescue in case you forgot or lost your login information Reader comments Bug Bounty Hunter Launches Accidental DDoS Attack on 911 Systems via iOS Bug more on: DDoS i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google cracks down on shooter of self-driving minivan photos By Ethan Baron / October 10, 2016 at 1:01 PM Standing in a Google employee parking lot, innovation consultant Mario Herger could see inside a fenced-off garage holding a number of Google’s self-driving cars. Herger was looking at the cars because he’s writing a book about self-driving vehicles. Then he noticed something unusual, he said, beyond the Lexus SUVs and prototype cars he’d expected to see: minivans. These were no ordinary minivans, as the self-driving-vehicle sensors installed on them showed. Herger, CEO of boutique innovation consultancy Enterprise Garage, was apparently viewing Google’s next step in fully autonomous vehicles, the fruits of a partnership with Fiat Chrysler announced in May. Herger shot photos, and posted them on the Enterprise Garage blog. Two hours later, he said, he heard from Google by email. The company said he’d had no authorization to be on Google property, from which he’d taken the photos, and demanded he take down his post and the photos. “Though I have not climbed any fences, broken into buildings, or saw any No Trespassing sign, I was on their property,” Herger told SiliconBeat. “So I complied.” Herger’s book on self-driving vehicles is to be published in German, then English. Herger had given website Electrek permission to publish the photos, so the images remained online after he took down his blog post. Electrek agreed to allow SiliconBeat to publish from among the photos on its site. In May, Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced a partnership to equip 100 Chrysler “Pacifica” minivans with self-driving technology. “The first six minivans arrived at one of Google’s facilities in Mountain View and the company already equipped two of them with sensor suites and installed mounting systems on others,” said an Electrek article Sunday. Google is reportedly expanding a carpooling service widely believed to be an attempt to go after Uber’s market — self-driving minivans could fit well with that business model in the future. Google, in an email, called the report by Electrek “inaccurate,” but did not specify in what way the company believes it to be wrong. Google is currently testing its fleet of 24 Lexus SUVs and 34 bubble-like prototype cars, both of which are regularly seen — with drivers on standby ready to take over — on Bay Area public roads. The company’s September report noted that its cars had collectively passed the two-million-mile mark while in autonomous mode.     Photo: Purported Google self-driving minivans in Mountain View (courtesy of Electrek) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Chrysler, Elektrek, Enterprise Garage, fiat chrysler, Google, minivans, Pacifica, self-driving   More Posts in Big Tech Apple now selling pre-owned iPhones from online store November 9, 2016   Google’s driving app ‘Android Auto’ now works as free standalone on phones November 8, 2016   Google Search to provide federal, state election results November 7, 2016       Share this Post Tweet       Richard Birecki Glad to see protective of their IP — Here’s an interesting column on how it will affect real estate prices. http://me.richtrek.com/2015/09/why-buying-real-estate-in-los-angeles.html interesting theory, agree or disagree     About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV     Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Petition for electoral college coup against Trump gets more… Grubhub CEO faces backlash for anti-Trump message to… Surveillance, encryption concerns in the wake of Donald… Facebook glitch tells users they’re dead Facebook faces lawsuit over naked photo of 14-year-old girl     Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2016 Bay Area News Group.

SUBSCRIBE Google labels your links, such as ‘footer’ or Penguin-impacted Google's manual action team has access to look at a page's link labels and may use that to dig deeper into the site's activities. Barry Schwartz on October 10, 2016 at 2:23 pm More In the A conversation with Google’s Gary Illyes (part 1) podcast at Marketing Land, our sister site, we learned that Google adds labels to your links. These labels can add classifications or attributes to the link, including whether the link is a footer link, whether it’s impacted by the latest Penguin update, whether it’s disavowed or other categorizations. A link can have multiple labels that make up the value and meaning of that link, which ultimately helps Google determine how to rank the related documents on the web. Google’s manual actions team may look at these labels to determine if they should dig deeper into the site’s links and add a manual action penalty to the site or not. Although, Illyes added, he doesn’t do much work with that specific team, so he isn’t too aware of their daily processes. In addition, Illyes listed three types of labels one might find on a link: “Penguin real time,” which would be the new Penguin algorithm; “footer” links, which would help Google determine how important the link is — i.e., it being in the footer versus the main content; and “disavow” — so if a link is in the disavow file, it will also be labeled as such for that site. There are many more link labels, but he only shared these three. Here is the audio embed of just this section: Here is the transcript: Barry Schwartz: Is there some sort of flag that happens automatically. So that the manual action team is notified that, hey, there is a devalue going on here by Penguin? Gary Illyes: I don’t work much with the manual actions team, but to the best of my knowledge, there is no flag that said that they have; they can look at the labels on the on the links or a site gets. Basically, we have tons of link labels; for example, it’s a footer link, basically, that has a lot lower value than an in-content link. Then another label would be a Penguin real-time label. If they see that most of the links are Penguin real-time labeled, then they might actually take a deeper look and see what the content owner is trying to do. Danny Sullivan: You were talking about how Penguin is looking and identifying things and to think of it as part of like a link label. So, like Google is looking at things like, OK, I know this is a footer link or this is a content link or this is a Penguin link. So tell us more about that. Gary Illyes: So, if you think about it, there are tons of different kinds of links on the internet. There are footer links, for example. There are Penguinized links, and all of these kinds of links have certain labels internally attached to them, basically for our own information. And if the manual actions team is reviewing a site for whatever reason, and they see that most of links are labeled as Penguin real-time affected, then they might decide to take a much deeper look on the site and see what’s up with those links and what could be the reason those links exist — and then maybe apply a manual action on the site because of the links. Barry Schwartz: Which is why Google still recommends you disavow links, because I guess if a manual action team sees all these labels on it, and they look at the disavow file, and they say, hey this SEO or this webmaster [is] aware of these links and they’re going ahead and trying to take no responsibility… Would these labels show up if the links are disavowed, or they probably wouldn’t? Gary Illyes: So disavow is again, basically, just a label internally. It’s applied on the links and anchors. And then you can see that, as well. Basically, you could have like a link from, I don’t know, WhiteHouse.gov, and it has labels Penguin RT, footer and disavow. And then they would see that — they would know that someone or the webmaster or content owner is actively tackling those links. You can listen to part one of the interview at Marketing Land.

SUBSCRIBE Google Penguin looks mostly at your link source, says Google When we asked Google's Gary Illyes about Penguin, he said SEOs should focus on where their links come from for the most part, but they have less to worry about now that Penguin devalues those links, as opposed to demoting the site. Barry Schwartz on October 10, 2016 at 3:22 pm More Here’s another nugget of information learned from the A conversation with Google’s Gary Illyes (part 1) podcast at Marketing Land, our sister site: Penguin is coined a “web spam” algorithm, but it indeed focuses mostly on “link spam.” Google has continually told webmasters that this is a web spam algorithm, but every webmaster and SEO focuses mostly around links. Google’s Gary Illyes said their focus is right, that they should be mostly concerned with the links when tackling Penguin issues. Gary Illyes made a point to clarify that it isn’t just the link, but rather the “source site” the link is coming from. Google said Penguin is based on “the source site, not on the target site.” You want your links to come from quality sources, as opposed to a low-quality source. One example Gary revealed was his looking at a negative SEO case submitted to him, and he said the majority of the links were on “empty profile pages, forum profile pages.” When he looked at those links, the new Penguin algorithm was already “discounting” those links, devaluing those links. “The good thing is that it is discounting the links, basically ignoring the links instead of the demoting,” Gary Illyes added. Here is the audio snippet: Here is the transcript: Barry Schwartz: You also talked about web spam versus link spam and Penguin. I know John Mueller specifically called it out again, in the original Penguin blog post that you had posted, that you said this is specifically a web spam algorithm. But every SEO that I know focuses just on link spam regarding Penguin. And I know when you initially started talking about this on our podcast just now, you said it’s mostly around really really bad links. Is that accurate to say when you talk about Penguin, [that] typically it’s around really, really bad links and not other types of web spam? Gary Illyes: It’s not just links. It looks at a bunch of different things related to the source site. Links is just the most visible thing and the one that we decided to talk most about because we already talked about about links in general. But it looks at different things on the source site, not on the target site, and then makes decisions based on those special signals. I don’t actually want to reveal more of those spam signals because I think they would be pretty, I wouldn’t say easy to spam, but they would easy to mess with. And I really don’t want that. But there are quite a few hints in the original, the old Penguin article. Barry Schwartz: Can you mention one of those hints that is in the article? Gary Illyes: I would rather not. I know that you can make pretty good assumptions. So I would just let you make assumptions. Danny Sullivan: If you were making assumptions, how would you make those assumptions? Gary Illyes: I try not to make assumptions. I try to to make decisions based on data. Barry Schwartz: Should we be focusing on a link spam aspect of it for Penguin? Obviously, focus on all the “make best quality sites,” yada-yada-yada, but we talk about Penguin as reporters, and we’re telling people that SEOs are like Penguin specialists or something like that — they only focus on link spam — Is that wrong? I mean should they? Gary Illyes: I think that’s the the main thing that they should focus on. See where it is coming from, and then make a decision based on the source site — whether they want that link or not. Well, for example, like I was looking at the negative SEO case just the yesterday or two days ago. And basically, the content owner played hundreds of links on empty profile pages, forum profile pages. Those links with the new Penguin were discounted. But like if you looked at the page, it was pretty obvious that the links were placed there for a very specific reason, and that’s to game the ranking algorithms. But not just Google’s but any other ranking algorithm that uses links. Like if you look at a page, you can make a pretty easy decision on whether to disavow or remove that link or not. And that’s what Penguin is doing. It’s looking at signals on the source page. Basically, what kind of page it is, what could be the purpose of that link ,and then make a decision based on that whether to discount those things or not. The good thing is that it is discounting the links, basically ignoring the links instead of the demoting. So in general, unless people are overdoing it, it’s unlikely that they will actually feel any sort of effect by placing those. But again, if they are overdoing it, then the manual actions team might take a deeper look. You can listen to part one of the interview at Marketing Land.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Kirk McMaster no longer Cyanogen CEO, controversial exec’s replacement still unknown By John Hoff - October 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Kirk McMaster, the controversial and outspoken head of Cyanogen Inc. is no longer head of the said tech company – this after leading Cyanogen in a bid to ultimately take down Google. He famously said that his aim was to make Cyanogen free of Google, but it looks like that won’t be happening, at least not under his leadership. Some tech pundits noticed today that McMaster changed his official job title of his LinkedIn account to “Executive Chairman.” While that still sounds impressive to our mortal ears, the title is actually a pretty vague one, and it can mean that he’ll be given some sort of high-level organizational responsibility, but the big idea is that McMaster won’t take the lead role in product and company strategy, as well as day to day operations of Cyanogen. It can be remembered that some inside sources gave information to the press about Cyanogen possibly lying about the number of users they have in the times they were looking for investors and in the marketing build-up to putting out Cyanogen OS. The number bandied around was “50 million users,” but the insiders say it was closer to around 3 million. And McMaster was the face that people knew behind the push of Cyanogen OS to make it big in the industry. No official announcement has been made yet, but we expect that to come soon. No possible replacement has been discussed, so we will have to wait until this piece of news becomes official. As of now, the Cyanogen Inc. website still lists McMaster as CEO.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close 123rf.com Salesforce still considering bid for Twitter, but its shareholders resist Reuters Oct 10, 2016 (…) 123rf.com Updated at 3:40 p.m. Salesforce.com Inc. is still deliberating whether it should make an offer for Twitter Inc. in the face of resistance from Salesforce shareholders over the strategic merits and valuation of such a deal, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Twitter shares have lost as much as a third of their value since Oct. 5 on concerns the company has attracted less interest from potential acquirers than previously envisaged. It now has a market capitalization of $12.3 billion after its shares fell 11.5 percent on Monday to close at $17.56. Salesforce is deliberating whether it is worth making a lowball offer for Twitter in the coming days based on Twitter's stock performance and any news of other bidders, the people said. Other potential acquirers such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Walt Disney Co. have backed away from making offers for the Internet company, the people said. There may however be other companies contemplating offers for Twitter whose identity has not yet been reported, some of the sources suggested. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Salesforce declined to comment while Twitter, Google and Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters previously reported that Twitter aimed to conclude deliberations about selling itself by Oct. 27, when it reports its third-quarter earnings. Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software. Unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at business users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships. A potential acquisition of Twitter has weighed down Salesforce's stock since news broke on Sept. 23 that it was vying for Twitter. Its shares rose as much as 7 percent on Monday after a weekend report by Bloomberg News suggested Salesforce was unlikely to make an offer. Some analysts and investors have questioned why Salesforce would need to own Twitter, when it already licenses the Twitter "firehose" for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. At Salesforce's annual client conference last week, Benioff said Salesforce considers buying many companies but maintains discipline, and wished Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey "well." These comments tamped out expectations that Salesforce would be an aggressive bidder for Twitter. Since its founding a decade ago, Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. ____________ Our earlier story, by Reuters, posted at 1:49 p.m. See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Shares of Twitter Inc. slumped more than 13 percent in premarket trading on Monday after a weekend Bloomberg report that the social media company was unlikely to receive any bids. Salesforce.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Walt Disney Co., which had worked with banks on a potential acquisition, are unlikely to proceed, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. Twitter had planned to hold a board meeting with outside advisers on Friday to discuss a sale but canceled, Bloomberg reported, citing one person familiar with the matter. Twitter shares plunged about 20 percent over the final two days of last week after technology website Recode reported that Google, Disney and Apple were not interested in buying the company, which put itself up for potential sale in September. Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff had publicly expressed his interest in Twitter, but stopped short of saying the company would make a bid. Twitter's stock, which closed at $19.85 on Friday, are trading at $17.19, down $2.66, about an hour before markets close in New York. At that price, the company has a market value of $12.03 billion, compared with almost $53 billion at its peak in December 2013. Twitter, struggling with stagnant user growth and continuing losses, had told potential acquirers it wanted any deliberations on a sale to conclude by the time it reported third-quarter results on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Many investors and analysts believe that Twitter, co-founded and run by Jack Dorsey, does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired.

Samsung is a crucial Google partner for its Android mobile operating system. Indeed, Android and Samsung have become almost synonymous for many consumers these days - something that Google may not particularly want for its open mobile operating system. So perhaps to shift that perception, Google is trying to stake its own claim to being the premier Android brand with its recent introduction of its Pixel and Pixel XL. Google is moving on the high-end smartphone world at a good time. Samsung, the world's top-selling smartphone maker, is dealing with a potentially brand-crushing crisis. First its new, top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 7 phones caught on fire; now the replacement ones are reportedly exploding, too. The Yonhap News Agency in South Korea reported eight cases of fires in replacement phones, five in the United States, one in South Korea and another in Taiwan. The fallout has been clear: Slightly more than a third of Samsung smartphone owners said they would not buy another phone from the company after the Galaxy Note 7 recall, according to a survey from brand consultant firm Branding Brand, which conducted the poll before the replacements started catching on fire. Meanwhile, Google's other rival in the mobile world - Apple - has been dogged by complaints that it is lagging in innovation. Many analysts who expressed that concern were not soothed by the latest iPhone, which took some small steps forward but also controversially ditched the headphone jack. Google went out of its way to mock the iPhone when it introduced the $769 Pixel, noting that its brand-new smartphone is cutting edge but retains its headphone jack. Google even bragged about its new shade of blue for its smartphone, which could be read as a parody of Apple's genuine excitement over its new shade of black. Sabrina Ellis, Google director of product management, talks about the colors of the new Google Pixel phone. Photo / AP Continued below. Related Content Samsung suspends production of Note 7, problems deepen Samsung suspends production of Note 7 Video Watch: Google takes on rivals with Pixel phone But Samsung's slide, and the damage from its horrendous Galaxy Note 7 launch is perhaps an even greater gift to Google. Many people have turned to Samsung phones as the anti-iPhone preference of choice. With customers admitting they're getting wary about other models of Samsung phones - despite the fact that none have had problems anywhere near the scale as the Note 7 - Google's Pixel fits neatly into whatever gap Samsung leaves behind. Compounding those woes even more is the Galaxy battery fires are happening right before the holidays when smartphone companies do their best business. "I think Samsung in their rush to get out the next product obviously didn't study it well enough and now they are suffering the consequences of that lack of care," said Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-area telecommunications analyst, in an e-mail. "This is devastating to Samsung and will continue to be devastating to Samsung." While Samsung initially reported that the vast majority of Note 7 customers who traded in their phones were choosing another Samsung phone, anecdotal reports online indicate that is no longer the case. In fact, AT&T and T-Mobile said they were going to stop exchanging the Note 7 phones even before Samsung confirmed that it was halting all production of the phone. Even Samsung said it can't fault them for that decision, in light of the scattered reports that the replacement phones are suffering from the same heat problems as the faulty phones they replaced. "We recognize that carrier partners have stopped sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7 in response to reports of heat damage issues, and we respect their decision," Samsung said in a statement. There's no guarantee Google will be able to swoop in and fill the gap completely. The Pixel phones are only available through Verizon, unless shoppers want to pay the full price for an unlocked version on Google's own store. Verizon is the nation's largest carrier, but the exclusive arrangement may limit sales. Still, even if Google's own phone doesn't manage to be the iPhone alternative of the holiday season, the company will still likely see other Android manufacturers get a boost through the end of the year. "While this is terrible news for Samsung, it may be great news for their competitors," Kagan said. "LG, Moto, Huawei and many other Android smartphones will quickly fill the gap left by this Samsung problem." - Washington Post By Hayley Tsukayama Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

bit-tech.net Home News Reviews Hardware Modding Gaming Blog Forums Search All Hardware Gaming Industry Other Google, Monotype release all-encompassing Noto typeface Published on 7th October 2016 by Gareth Halfacree 4 Comments News Google's Noto project aims to eliminate 'tofu,' the 'missing glyph' boxes, with support for 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. Google and Monotype have jointly announced the release of one of the most wide-reaching typography projects in history: an attempt to create a single typeface family encompassing all languages. Dubbed Noto, the aim of Google and Monotype's new typeface is simple: no more tofu, the latter referring to the 'missing glyph' boxes you'll see when your chosen typeface does not have the symbol requested by a document. Noto, by contrast, looks to have every symbol you could possibly need: over the past five years, the two companies have worked to add support for 800 languages and 100 writing scripts, all with a harmonious look-and-feel, plus numbers, symbols, musical notation, and the rapidly-growing collection of 'emojis.' 'We are passionately dedicated to type and helping to advance the use and adoption of type across many cultures, languages and geographies. We are thrilled to have played such an important role in what has become one of the most significant type projects of all time,' crowed Monotype president and chief executive Scott Landers at the unveiling. 'The combination of Monotype’s type expertise and Google’s innovation has proven to be a productive relationship and we look forward to continued collaboration that helps advance the use of type to new places.' Some of the work, which has taken a team of hundreds of researchers, designers, linguists, cultural experts, and the inevitable project managers five years so far, has been more in-depth than others: adding support for the Tibetan language, for instance, saw a team of researchers analyse a vast trove of writing and other source material followed by a quality control pass from members of a Buddhist monastery who spend their time studying and copying Tibetan manuscripts. 'Even though we prioritise widely used languages, we still want to support other languages, even if there are no people still speaking them,' explained Google's Xiangye Xiao of the project's scope. 'There are some characters you can only see on stones. If you don’t move them to the web, over time those stones will become sand and we’ll never be able to recover those drawings or that writing.' The Google Noto family is available for free under the Open Font Licence (OFL), from the official website. Its first public release came in July 2014, but it has recently added additional languages and re-licensed from the Apache Licence 2.0 to the Open Font Licence.

Samsung Electronics Co.’s mounting crisis with its flagship Galaxy Note 7 has left millions of premium smartphone buyers looking for an alternative. The obvious candidate is Apple’s iPhone 7, but Google’s slick new Pixel device could get a lift, too. Samsung recalled and pledged to replace millions of Note 7 phones in early September after reports that their batteries were bursting into flame. But over the past week, new reports have emerged that some replacement phones are catching on fire, too. Samsung has now asked retailers to stop selling all Note 7 phones while the company and U.S. officials investigate why the new batch of devices seem to be afflicted with the same problem. Many people upgrade their phones during the Christmas shopping season, giving Apple and Google an opportunity to fill the Samsung vacuum -- and making it even harder for the South Korean company to bounce back. The Pixel may be especially appealing to Samsung users looking for another device that runs the Android operating system. “There’s been a shift toward bigger screen devices, and there’s less competition there given the Note 7 issue, so there’s definitely more opportunities for the iPhone 7 Plus,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. As for Google, “the Pixel suddenly has got very limited competition at the high end of the market.” Samsung on Tuesday asked wireless carriers to stop selling its most expensive phone and instructed consumers to stop using them. The move came as carriers including AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Sprint Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Australia’s Telstra Corp. halted Note 7 sales following reports of problems with devices thought to be safe. Before the exploding batteries, Samsung had defied a slowing smartphone market with better-than expected Galaxy sales and successfully capitalized on a lull in demand for new iPhones. In recent months, Samsung had expanded its already considerable market share. The company shipped 77 million smartphones in the second quarter for a market share of 22 percent, that’s up from 73 million, or 21 percent share a year ago, according to IDC. Apple’s shipments dropped 15 percent to leave it with market share of 12 percent.   Now the South Korean company enters the crucial holiday shopping season with no large-screen smartphone. Because Samsung and Apple have basically split the market for $700-plus smartphones between them, the latter is a natural beneficiary of Samsung’s woes. Investors seem to expect that to happen and pushed Apple shares up 1.7 percent to $116.05 Monday in New York, the highest level since December 2015. In the long-term, Apple could attract Android users to its “sticky iOS ecosystem, which boasts a ~95 percent loyalty rate,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note.

The Pixel is the first phone the search giant has conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. It has a number of features that will be broadly appealing, including a Siri-like virtual assistant, a flashy camera and speedy apps. Of course, the Pixel is untested, Google’s previous forays into hardware have floundered, and the company lacks its own retail stores. How much Apple and Google benefit depends on what Samsung does next. Already pressure is mounting for the company to kill its troubled phone altogether. Said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. in Seoul: “It’s meaningless to continue producing the Note 7."

According to the Wall Street Journal, Google wants assistant to be more personable than the likes of Alexa and Siri, and that means an improved sense of humour. While the aforementioned apps will tell you a joke, or offer the occasional witty retort, Google seemingly wants Assistant to raise the bar for the Google Home speaker. Related: Google Home - Your complete guide This is likely be to further its goal of users developing “an emotional connection” with Assistant. A little humour, it seems, could go a long way. Google introduced us to the latest version of Assistant at its Pixel event last week. It is available within the new Allo chat app, but the most exciting application is the voice-powered, Amazon Echo-rivalling Google Home device. Home will go on sale in the United States next month for $129, undercutting the $179 Echo. It is currently available to pre-order. Just like the Echo, it can control music streaming, search the web for information, command smart home devices and access the calendar. Google believes the conversational Assistant will make Home a better option than Alexa.

These include playback entertainment throughout the home and searching Google for any request, no matter how trivial, all via voice-control. The design of the speaker-like device is minimal and futuristic-looking but not overwhelmingly so, and can be matched with consumers’ interiors as it comes in seven different shades that vary from copper to purple and monochrome. It’s petite and circular in size, around the size of a large hardback book, and the bottom half is detachable, meaning users can also change the color when they feel like it, depending on their mood. It only contains one concealed button and no switches or screens, ensuring the focus is on the voice-control function, however it has a touchscreen surface that can be used for volume control. There’s also a ‘mic mute’ button for privacy, should someone be able to overhear a restaurant suggestion for a family member’s birthday celebration. The voice-controlled home device is constantly on the lookout for commands, ready to serve the user at any given moment and as soon as it hears, “OK Google,” from a pre-recorded, registered member of the family. Once connected, Google’s Assistant, which is built into the device, can answer questions, according to Google in the form of a “two-way dialogue,” and also control other connectable devices around the space. It also plays music, podcasts or different radio stations from compatible services like Google Play Music, Spotify, YouTube Music and Pandora. Watch the intro video below: Now that the Google Home collection is all but complete, it will be interesting to see how consumers take to it, and how it competes with Apple’s Home. The device is now available to pre-order via the designated Google Home website.

It’s obvious you’re getting information from a machine that lacks its own personality, which is why both Apple and Google have gone to such lengths to make Siri and Google Now entertaining in some form. Google’s upcoming Assistant AI voice will have something a little special, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. The company has hired comedy and joke writers who worked on Pixar movies and the satire site The Onion in order to breathe life into the artificial intelligence assistant, to make it feel more personable. It’s a unique effort and the first time we’ve heard of a company hiring writers for their assistants. As more devices like Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other connected devices make their way into our living room with the promise of information at just the sound of a keyword, Google has to find a way to make its Assistant pleasurable to converse with and easy to use. We’ll find out if that extra boost from paid writers pays off for Google on October 20th when Google’s Pixel phones debut. local_offer    Google Assistant   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (8) stars Further Reading Third-party Google Assistant tools coming IFTTT now includes a Google Assistant Channel Google Assistant vs Siri How to use Google Assistant Google Assistant has a trivia game stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Five Galaxy Note 7 alternatives Eric Abent - Oct 10, 2016 23 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It would seem that the Galaxy Note 7 just can’t put its problems behind it. With Samsung rumored to be halting production on the handset after reports of a fresh round of battery problems and all of the major US carriers now offering to swap the phone out for something different, Galaxy Note 7 owners are in a tough spot when it comes to selecting a new phone. To help make the transition a little smoother, here are five handsets (in no particular order) you can pick to replace your Galaxy Note 7. 1. iPhone 7 Plus Yes, the idea of making the jump to Apple might be unthinkable to some Android users, but as someone who switches between both operating systems on a whim, it’s not nearly as bad as some would have you believe. For starters, the iPhone 7 Plus has one of the best cameras available on a smartphone at this point in time, and all of Google’s apps play nicely with iOS. It doesn’t matter how deep in Google’s ecosystem you are, you can continue using services like Play Music, Docs, Gmail, and Chrome on iOS without missing a beat. In fact, the first time I jumped between Android and iPhone, I was surprised by how relatively seamless the transition was. If you’ve been wondering what you’ve been missing on the iOS side of things, this might be a good opportunity to see how the other side lives. Additionally, with the 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 7 Plus, you’ll be getting a phone that’s similar in size to the Galaxy Note 7. Still not convinced? Our review might further sway you to the dark side. 2. Galaxy S7 Edge If you’d rather stick with Android – and more specifically Samsung – then the Galaxy S7 Edge should serve as a solid replacement for your Galaxy Note 7. While it doesn’t come equipped with an S-Pen, it does have a similar screen size, and its excellent internals mean it’ll be a long time before this phone is made obsolete. Perhaps best of all, it’s compatible with the micro USB accessories you likely already have, delaying the changeover to USB-C a little longer – not that USB-C is a bad thing, of course. Quite the contrary, USB-C is great, but changing over is always a hassle. If you don’t mind a smaller phone, the standard Galaxy S7 earns an honorable mention here. For those who aren’t crazy about the curved display that adorns both the Note 7 and S7 Edge, the Galaxy S7 is the clear choice of the three, especially considering it may be the last phone without a curved display that Samsung releases for some time. Read through our review of the Galaxy S7 Edge for more! 3. Google Pixel XL On the other hand, those who want to avoid Samsung entirely may want to have a look at the Google Pixel XL. Google is looking to make a big splash in the smartphone market with its new Pixel offerings, and the Pixel XL is shaping up to be a solid device. Whether its the camera that scored a DxOMark Mobile rating of 89 (the highest of any smartphone camera) or the deep Google Assistant integration, Google is definitely looking for a standout phone here. With that in mind, the Pixel and Pixel XL will only be sold in Verizon stores and through Google’s online store (note that you can purchase unlocked Pixels through Google). Off-contract pricing is as high as any other smartphone, though there are monthly financing options available if you’d prefer to go that route. Just as well, the phone isn’t expected to ship out until October 20, so you may need to fall back to an older device while you wait for your Pixel XL to arrive. We have some early impressions on the Pixel and Pixel XL to share, so check it out if Google’s incoming phone has piqued your interest. 4. LG V20 The LG V20 is another phone that has yet to be released, but it has one major advantage over some of the other phones on this list: it ships with Android 7.0 Nougat, bringing you up to speed with the most recent version of Android out of the box. Couple that with the large display LG is including in this package, and you should have a pretty decent alternative to the Note 7. This has the same problem as the Google Pixel XL, however, in that it’s not actually available yet. This means that you’ll have to either stick with your current Note 7 for a couple more week or jump back to an older phone to fill the gap while you wait for the V20 to release. If that sounds like something you can deal with, though, have a look at our hands-on with the device to see early impressions. 5. Galaxy Note 5 This may well be the best choice for disappointed Galaxy Note 7 owners, even though this phone is the oldest one on the list. Despite being a year old, the Galaxy Note 5 can still hold its own in terms of hardware, and it will be the most familiar to Note 7 users. Not looking to sacrifice the S-Pen? The Galaxy Note 5 might be the phone for you. If you don’t care that much about having the absolute best that’s currently available and don’t want to part ways with the features that make a Galaxy Note a Galaxy Note, then the Note 5 is probably a safe bet. Have a look at our Galaxy Note 5 review for more – even though some time has passed, most of what we had to say remains true today.

The technology giant has invited building companies to pitch to construct the project, which was approved in 2013 and later shelved for a more ambitious development, the people said, asking not to be identified because the process is private. Google aims to start building the headquarters before the end of next year, the people said. Spokeswomen for Google and Argent LLP, the developer of the site, declined to comment. Two months after Google won approval for the 920,000 square-foot building next to King’s Cross railway station, the company scrapped the plans, which included a roof-top running track, in favor of building “something even better,” Joe Borrett, Google’s head of real estate and construction, told The Telegraph newspaper at the time. The decision to start searching for a contractor for the project underlines London’s enduring appeal to technology companies even after the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union. Apple Inc. agreed to lease 500,000 square feet at the Battersea Power Station development on the River Thames last month. The company has since leased two other buildings in the district. Workers began moving into 6 Pancras Square in June and a second Google office at the King’s Cross Central site was approved by Camden Council in February.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Sticking with one email address is a security risk ADAM TURNER Last updated 08:29, October 11 2016 Having a separate free webmail account for services which you think are likely to leak your email address helps to protect you from spammers and hackers. Reusing passwords is a major security risk but another sensible precaution is to avoid using the same email address for everything. Creating extra addresses or aliases can be a hassle, but it certainly makes it more difficult for hackers to bring you down. One simple way to do this is to use a separate free webmail account – from the likes of Microsoft, Google or Yahoo! – to sign up for services which you think are likely to leak your email address to spammers and hackers. Something like ilovetoshop92@gmail.com might do the trick, ensuring you only use it when signing up for cut-rate online shopping sites. READ MORE: * Google will now write email replies for you * Smartphone email notifications 'a toxic source of stress * Five hints and tips for Gmail To make life easier, you might forward this account to your primary email address but filter those emails into a sub-folder or colour code them so you can easily tell where they came from. This way if you receive an email to that address regarding a supposed unpaid tax bill, overdue electricity account or request to reset social media passwords you can safely ignore it – knowing that it's a scammer trying to trick you. Most online scams take a shotgun approach but some are targeted particularly at you, especially if you run a business. Another way to stay safe is to use different email addresses for all your important online services. Managing a dozen webmail accounts is obviously a hassle, an easier way to go about it is to create alias email addresses which funnel into your primary inbox, once again using sub-folders or colour coding so they're easy to spot. Think of it like using a PO Box to receive your snail mail, so you don't have to tell the world where you live. Ad Feedback Different email services support aliases in different ways, so it's worth checking the advanced settings. Some let you choose any login, such as FakeEmailAddress@YourDomain.com, while others even let you choose from a range of domain names so you can use FakeEmailAddress@SomeOtherDomain.com. Unfortunately Google isn't this flexible, if you're fred@gmail.com you can use fred+alias@gmail.com which helps in some circumstances but doesn't mask your true email address. This trick also makes it easier to spot phony emails, as emails which are sent to the wrong alias are clearly bogus – for example an Amazon password reset sent to ebay@yourdomain.com is certainly fake, and vice versa. The same goes for banking-related emails which aren't sent to the unique email address you only use with that bank. Once again it's important not to use these aliases elsewhere. Using aliases also helps protect you against targeted attacks, because hackers can't break into an account which doesn't exist – particularly useful for cloud storage and backup services which contain sensitive information. Your primary email address might be fred@yourdomain.com, but hackers targeting you will have no luck breaking into your Dropbox account if it's under dropbox@yourdomain.com or something more obscure which you never reveal publicly. You might think that having a strong password and using two-factor authentication are enough to keep you safe – and they certainly help – but by using a unique alias you're also foiling social engineering attempts to trick tech support into resetting your password, or attempts to hijack your mobile number to intercept two-factor codes.  - Sydney Morning Herald Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Digital Living story: Magic tricks on YouTube are in danger of killing the art, warns its inner circle Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake Spain's plot to end memes Tech battle over whiteboards BlackBerry's keyboard coming back $180 Snapchat glasses fetch $1400 How tech has changed since 2008 Tech funding boom Trump's social media 'in crowd' Kiwi behind self-piloting drones Facebook tells users they're dead Facebook influenced election?

Google is making a big strategy shift with the Pixel and Google Home. Adam Levy (adamlevy) Oct 10, 2016 at 2:32PM Image source: Google. The first thing I do when I purchase a new smartphone is go to the app store and download a bunch of apps made by Google -- Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, and Google Drive, to name a few. Even on an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, I prefer to use a lot of the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary's services. And Google makes it easy to use its services regardless of what platform you're using. Google's advertising business model relies on reaching the widest possible audience to maximize revenue. But Google's newest software -- a virtual assistant simply called Google Assistant -- is available only on the new hardware Google unveiled at the beginning of the month. (A less robust version of the software is available through its new chat app Allo as well.) The decision represents a major shift in strategy for Google that bears further examination. An AI-first world At the top of Google's keynote earlier this month, CEO Sundar Pichai told the audience, "We are moving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world." The user interface has moved from desktop PCs, to the web, to mobile, and now you can literally have a conversation with your computer. Whether that computer is a PC, phone, watch, or some cross between a speaker and a HAL 9000 doesn't matter. There are a growing number of AI assistants: Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Viv, and now Google Assistant. Apple used Siri to further differentiate the iPhone, and clandestinely break its reliance on Google search. (Siri uses Bing for search results.) Microsoft introduced Cortana to differentiate Windows Mobile, but it's since brought the AI to several platforms, including Windows 10, iOS, and Android. Amazon.com introduced Alexa as part of its Echo speaker, and when the product took off, it extended it to its Kindle Fire tablets. How else could Google compete? Google finds itself competing against a range of competitors, all of which have established user bases: Siri on iPhones, Cortana on Windows PCs, and Alexa on Echo and Kindle. Google's ability to overcome the competition simply through releasing another app in the Play Store or App Store is doubtful. Instead, it opted to integrate the software in some new high-end hardware, and compete in that market. Assistant functions as a differentiating factor for the Pixel and Home. Google showed off how much more powerful Google Assistant is compared with Alexa or Siri, since it's backed by Google's knowledge graph. The AI is one of the few things that differentiates the Pixel from other Android smartphones. Google Assistant requires a different monetization strategy The bigger problem for Google with Google Assistant is that the nature of the service is very hard to monetize. Unlike Google Search, which produces a list of query results that Google can easily slip some ads into, Google Assistant produces just one result per query -- hopefully the correct result. Ads don't fit into that model. By only including Google Assistant on its own hardware, Google is effectively monetizing its service through hardware sales. That's more akin to Apple's business model, especially since it's started giving away macOS updates. It's a big shift for Google, but one necessitated by the nature of the Google Assistant service and the platform Pichai sees computing moving toward. Why we may still see a wide release of Google Assistant The primary purpose of keeping Google Assistant exclusive to Google's hardware may be to differentiate the Pixel and monetize the software. Still, Google Assistant has the potential to benefit the company's core search product. The more people use the AI-powered assistant, the more data Google receives on its users and how they respond to certain answers. Google can feed that data back into its more easily monetized search engine and improve search results and the user experience. Indeed, continually improving its search engine and giving users more and more reasons to use it will move the needle much more than selling a few devices. Google runs a $67 billion advertising business. For reference, Apple sold nearly 55 million iPads last year and generated just $23 billion in sales from the device. The two factors that will affect Google's decision to extend Google Assistant to other devices are how well the Pixel sells and how much incremental revenue Google thinks it can squeeze out thanks to Assistant.

Google will open a pop-up retail store in Manhattan on Oct. 20, the company has confirmed. The store will be located at 96 Spring Street in Soho and focus on the many products Google talked about at its Oct. 4 event, including Google Pixel, Google Home, and others, The Next Web notes. Google offers few details about the store, but the term "pop up" means it will be temporary, most likely through the holidays. Rivals like Apple and Microsoft have more permanent brick-and-mortar locations in the Manhattan; Apple's Soho location is just two blocks from Google's pop-up shop. //Related Articles VIDEO: Microsoft Opens Huge Flagship NYC Store In 2013, Google also hosted a holiday pop-up shop in Bryant Park intended to show off the Nexus 7, Chromebook, Chromecast, and Google Play store. Google also previously had stores in New York, San Francisco and other cities as part of its Google Glass sales pitch. With that product on the decline in 2014, Google closed its stores. In London, though, there is a Google shop located inside Currys PC World on Tottenham Court Road. This time around, it will focus on more consumer-friendly and affordable gadgets like the $129 Google Home smart speaker. Also look for the new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the new name for the Nexus lineup, which will be made entirely by Google. They feature 5- and 5.5-inch screens, respectively, run Android Nougat, and come with what Google says is the world's best smartphone camera.

Here's why. Trust in Google Although this is Google's first leap into smartphone design and engineering, there's little reason to be concerned. The company has long held to high standards of care for hardware engineering, and those who have already held the Pixel say it feels (and performs) the way a smartphone should. Google might be the latest entrant into the smartphone market, but with ample cash in the bank and a strong desire to take on—and eventually beat—Apple, early adopters shouldn't have too much cause for concern. This isn't a startup; it's Google. An Overall Solid Design Google's Pixel comes with an attractive design, featuring a slim profile, rounded edges, and comfortable placement for the fingerprint sensor and mechanical buttons. Its metal finish is a design element that trumps many of the plastic Android-based handsets already on store shelves. In sum, the Google Pixel looks like the high-end smartphone it is. Finding Value in Google Assistant Google Assistant is the search giant's latest attempt at utilizing machine learning to deliver smarter solutions to its users, and the Google Pixel will be the first smartphone to support it. The feature is designed to help users find answers to questions, manage their tasks and even keep track of their travel itinerary. Best of all, Google Assistant will get smarter as time goes on, rewarding users for employing the service early and often. The Best Smartphone Camera, Google Says Google said at its press event that the Pixel will ship with the world's best smartphone camera. It will achieve that by offering a 12.3-megapixel rear-facing sensor with an f/2.0 aperture. In addition, it supports HDR+ for better color representation. Add that to the camera's strong performance and low light, and it might snap pictures that are at least on par with many digital SLR cameras. Unlimited (and Free) Storage Google said that Pixel owners will get unlimited storage for all of their photos and videos free of charge through its cloud-based servers. Better yet, all of that content will be stored in their raw format, so users don't lose quality by transferring videos or photos to and from their devices. It's also a great way to save precious storage space on a smartphone, which already comes with up to 128GB of storage. A Little VR Support From Google Daydream To boost its presence in virtual reality, Google said the Pixel will work with its new virtual reality headset, the Daydream View. At first glance, the Daydream View looks quite similar to Samsung' Gear VR, which also lets users insert a smartphone into the device to watch VR content. Anyone who preorders a Pixel will get a Daydream View headset free of charge. It's Nice to See Two Screen Sizes Choice is everything in the smartphone market, and Google understands that. Customers will be able to choose the Pixel in a 5-inch or a 5.5-inch version. The 5-inch version has full-HD resolution and 441 pixels per inch, while the 5.5-inch option comes in at 534 pixels per inch and boasts a slightly better quad-HD resolution. Let's Talk About Support Google will offer a support service for the Pixel called Care by Google. The service will be available 24/7 through an app bundled with the smartphone. When users open the app, they'll be given the option to chat with a Google expert or talk on the phone. The app also includes a screen-sharing feature so the support person can see what's happening on the device and fix it. A Word About Verizon Verizon will be Google's exclusive carrier partner with the Pixel. However, "exclusive" is a loaded term in this case. In addition to selling a Verizon-locked device at the carrier's stores, Google will sell an unlocked version for customers who don't want to be tied to the cellular provider. The Google Pixel also will be available on the company's Project Fi service. A Price That Delivers Value The Pixel starts at $649, putting it on par with other high-end smartphones such as the iPhone 7. Customers who want the 5.5-inch version, known as the Pixel XL, will pay $769. Boosting the device's storage from 32GB to 128GB adds another $100 to that price. A top-notch Pixel, in other words, could touch $869. Verizon is selling its Pixel at the same price, though customers also can choose a monthly installment plan that starts at $27.08. In either case, the Google Pixel is slated to start shipping Oct. 20. 10 Features Samsung Should Build Into the Galaxy S8 Smartphone View Slideshow » Why DNS Servers Are an Unprotected Back Door into Your Network View Slideshow » 11 Revolutionary Advances in Wireless Tech in 2016 View Slideshow » Panasonic Updates Toughpad FZ-G1 With More Power, Longer Battery Life View Slideshow » Broadcom, Qualcomm Latest Acquirers in Busy Chip Space View Slideshow » Why Donald Trump and Silicon Valley Don't See Eye to Eye View Slideshow » CIOs Expect Steady Growth in Health Care IT Spending, Cyber-Threats View Slideshow » Ransomware Takes Off, Web Browsers Under Attack: Kaspersky Report View Slideshow » TrueOS Succeeds PC-BSD Desktop-Friendly Unix OS View Slideshow » Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro View Slideshow » View All Slideshows >   In a first for Google, the company announced in San Francisco Oct. 4 it had designed and engineered a smartphone. The device, known as the Pixel, replaces Google's Nexus line, but like its predecessor, is designed to be the benchmark by which all of other Android-based devices are judged. The handset ships with the Android Nougat mobile operating system, comes with two screen sizes—5 inches and 5.5 inches—and offers what Google said is the industry's leading rear-facing smartphone camera. Couple that with an affordable price, a high-end processor and some nice looks, and the Google Pixel seems like a fine alternative to Apple's iPhone 7 this holiday season. In the following slides, eWEEK will detail some of the Pixel's best features and discuss the components that make it a great option for both consumers and enterprise users. Google has taken a mighty first step into the smartphone market, and its Pixel could become a powerful force in the hotly contested space.

The Commission is also conducting a separate antitrust investigation regarding Google allegedly taking advantage of its Android operating system to bolster its search platform. Vestager defended the pace of the cases against Google, one of which has been ongoing since 2010. “I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time. But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." In August, the European Commission ruled that Apple should pay $14.5 billion in back taxes, after it deemed that the Cupertino tech company had received unfair state aid from Ireland.

Source: AAP 11 Oct 2016 - 7:18 AM  UPDATED 11 Oct 2016 - 7:18 AM Tweet The EU regulator investigating whether Alphabet unit Google is abusing its market power has not extended its scrutiny to the tech giant's tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the bloc's antitrust chief says. Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($A20 billion) in back taxes to Ireland and Starbucks up to 30 million euros to the Dutch tax office, said Google was not on her radar for now. "So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one," Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google's 130-million-pound ($A210 million) back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticised as a derisory amount. Vestager also defended the slow pace of the Commission's antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010 when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday. "But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." Vestager said she did not know when she would issue a decision but the case was a very high priority for her. In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favouring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results. It has also been charged with blocking rivals in online search advertising and doing the same with dominant Android mobile operating system. The Commission has warned the company of hefty fines in both the shopping and Android cases and changes in its business practices if it is eventually found guilty of wrongdoing.

Google is scheduled to make an official response to charges of being anti-competitive, including its dominance on the Android operating system, in the coming weeks. But, Brussels is considering a fine against the company, according to Reuters which has seen documents relating to the charges, and which could potentially run into the billions of euros. *Read more*: Say 'allo to Allo - Google's WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger rival ​"We believe that Android has increased competition, lowered prices, and benefited users, developers and phone manufacturers," Google said in a statement on the matter. "We look forward to showing the European Commission how our approach has made Android a successful and sustainable open-source ecosystem." In the Android case, the EU argues Google favoured its own search engine on the operating system by forcing handset manufacturers to pre-install the app and also offering financial incentives to do so, claims which Google denies. The competition commission also claims Google favours its own comparison of shopping products in search results over rival shopping sites in a case finally brought to the charge stage last year after a five year investigation. After the Android charge in April, the EU brought another case against it in July in relation to search advertising results. The EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager has cracked down hard on tech companies, moving forward much more quickly with cases than her predecessor. *Read more*: Media groups could get Google payout from EU copyright rules This has culminated in slapping Apple with a €13bn bll for back taxes after deciding that its so-called sweetheart Irish tax deal broke antitrust laws. Both Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision. The case has raised tensions between US authorities and Brussels, with officials in the US accusing Europe of unfairly targeting companies across the pond. Google is expected to respond to charges by the end of October unless it's granted another extension by the commission. The EU can fine Alphabet-owned Google up to 10 per cent of annual turnover on each charge. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Other recent news in Business Lego ends DAILY MAIL toy giveaway after protest on migrant coverage Trump pledges restraint with Twitter from WHITE HOUSE SOUTH AFRICA's Seokolo elected chairman of IAEA governors First grid connection for PAKISTAN's Chasnupp-3 Rates on store-brand CREDIT CARDS climb to new heights JEREMY CORBYN: Donald Trump's election is a "global wake-up call" Pipeline protesters blocking NORTH DAKOTA construction yard Fin24.com | Zuckerberg among Facebook USERS MISTAKENLY declared 'dead' POPE FRANCIS Pushes for Inclusion in Race, Class, Religion Delhi pollution: Nearly 2 lakh heavy diesel VEHICLES to go off roads today Twitter Facebook Page People Donald Trump John Kerry Barack Obama Current Topics Refugees Australia Sign Modified UFC 205 Miesha Tate Spotlight 📺 Live TV 📺 ONP TV Movie Reviews Totally Aesthetic Staff Stories Would Bernie Sanders Have Beaten Trump?

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Cloud Computing, Downtime, Enterprise, Google Here’s Google’s Plan for Calming Enterprise Cloud Anxiety by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on October 10, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet Enterprises that sign up for Google’s cloud services will now have the choice to submit their software development and IT operations teams to the same level of operational rigor Google submits its own engineers to. The company on Monday revealed more details about a new approach to cloud customer support it announced last week, created to help alleviate customers’ anxiety about giving up control of their infrastructure to a cloud provider. It will embed its own experts on cloud customers’ teams to help them deploy and run applications in Google’s cloud data centers in the most reliable way possible. The services will include shared paging (when things go wrong), auto-creation and escalation of priority-one tickets, participation in customer “war rooms,” and Google-reviewed design and production system. The company will not charge a penny for what amounts to extremely hands-on professional services, but it doesn’t expect every customer to opt for them, given the level of commitment required on the customer’s part. Dave Rensin, Google’s director of Customer Reliability of Engineering: “This program won’t be for everyone. In fact, we expect that the overwhelming majority of customers won’t participate because of the effort involved. We think big enterprises betting multi-billion dollars businesses on the cloud, however, would be foolish to pass this up. Think of it as a de-risking exercise with a price tag any CFO will love.” Google has formed a new team to support this capability, called Customer Reliability Engineering. The title is a variation on Site Reliability Engineering, a concept created at Google years ago to describe software engineers responsible for building and operating Google’s global infrastructure. The company doesn’t differentiate between software development and IT and in fact prefers to have developers run infrastructure, assuming it’s a job handled better by people with deep understanding of software. CREs will work with customers’ dev teams the same way SREs work with developers at Google. There is a set of ground rules both sides agree to commit to. SREs accept the responsibility for maintaining uptime and healthy operation of a system if: The system (as developed) can pass a strict inspection process — known as a Production Readiness Review (PRR) The development team who built the system agrees to maintain critical support systems (like monitoring) and be active participants in key events like periodic reviews and postmortems The system does not routinely blow its error budget In a way, “error budget” is a different name for availability requirements, or SLAs, such as 99.9 or 99.999 percent uptime. Making Google developers on the product side of things responsible for reliability, SREs give them an error budget, and once they blow it, they have to spend all of their engineering time writing code that fixes the uptime problem they caused and make the system more stable overall. If the developers don’t hold up their side of the bargain, the SREs are free to “hand back the pagers,” meaning they are no longer committed to, say, coming the rescue when something goes down at 3 a.m. Google cloud customers that opt for working with the CRE team will have to agree to the same “social contract” in exchange for its services. Rensin: “When a customer fails to keep up their end of the work with timely bug fixes, participation in joint postmortems, good operational hygiene etc., we’ll ‘hand back the pagers’ too.” Previous Article NetSuite Shares Fall After Oracle Says Deal Needs More Support Next Article NFL Linemen Show Business How It’s Done Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Samsung Electronics Co.’s mounting crisis with its flagship Galaxy Note 7 has left millions of premium smartphone buyers looking for an alternative. The obvious candidate is Apple’s iPhone 7, but Google’s slick new Pixel device could get a lift, too. Samsung recalled and pledged to replace millions of Note 7 phones in early September after reports that their batteries were bursting into flame. But over the past week, new reports have emerged that some replacement phones are catching on fire, too. Samsung has now asked retailers to stop selling all Note 7 phones while the company and U.S. officials investigate why the new batch of devices seem to be afflicted with the same problem. Many people upgrade their phones during the Christmas shopping season, giving Apple and Google an opportunity to fill the Samsung vacuum -- and making it even harder for the South Korean company to bounce back. The Pixel may be especially appealing to Samsung users looking for another device that runs the Android operating system. “There’s been a shift toward bigger screen devices, and there’s less competition there given the Note 7 issue, so there’s definitely more opportunities for the iPhone 7 Plus,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. As for Google, “the Pixel suddenly has got very limited competition at the high end of the market.” Samsung on Tuesday asked wireless carriers to stop selling its most expensive phone and instructed consumers to stop using them. The move came as carriers including AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Sprint Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Australia’s Telstra Corp. halted Note 7 sales following reports of problems with devices thought to be safe. Before the exploding batteries, Samsung had defied a slowing smartphone market with better-than expected Galaxy sales and successfully capitalized on a lull in demand for new iPhones. In recent months, Samsung had expanded its already considerable market share. The company shipped 77 million smartphones in the second quarter for a market share of 22 percent, that’s up from 73 million, or 21 percent share a year ago, according to IDC. Apple’s shipments dropped 15 percent to leave it with market share of 12 percent.   Now the South Korean company enters the crucial holiday shopping season with no large-screen smartphone. Because Samsung and Apple have basically split the market for $700-plus smartphones between them, the latter is a natural beneficiary of Samsung’s woes. Investors seem to expect that to happen and pushed Apple shares up 1.7 percent to $116.05 Monday in New York, the highest level since December 2015. In the long-term, Apple could attract Android users to its “sticky iOS ecosystem, which boasts a ~95 percent loyalty rate,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note.

The Pixel is the first phone the search giant has conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. It has a number of features that will be broadly appealing, including a Siri-like virtual assistant, a flashy camera and speedy apps. Of course, the Pixel is untested, Google’s previous forays into hardware have floundered, and the company lacks its own retail stores. How much Apple and Google benefit depends on what Samsung does next. Already pressure is mounting for the company to kill its troubled phone altogether. Said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. in Seoul: “It’s meaningless to continue producing the Note 7."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama October 10 Follow @htsuka Samsung has stopped production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after a series of explosions in the original and replacement models surfaced. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) As the world watches Samsung deal with the fallout from what could be the worst smartphone launch in recent memory, there should be a smile on faces at Google headquarters. Samsung is a crucial Google partner for its Android mobile operating system. Indeed, Android and Samsung have become almost synonymous for many consumers these days — something that Google may not particularly want for its open mobile operating system. So perhaps to shift that perception, Google is trying to stake its own claim to being the premier Android brand with its recent introduction of its Pixel and Pixel XL. [Google moves into hardware production with smartphone and other devices] Google is moving on the high-end smartphone world at a good time. Samsung, the world's top-selling smartphone maker, is dealing with a potentially brand-crushing crisis. First its new, top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 7 phones caught on fire; now the replacement ones are reportedly exploding, too. The Yonhap News Agency in South Korea reported eight cases of fires in replacement phones, five in the United States, one in South Korea and another in Taiwan. The fallout has been clear: Slightly more than a third of Samsung smartphone owners said they would not buy another phone from the company after the Galaxy Note 7 recall, according to a survey from brand consultant firm Branding Brand, which conducted the poll before the replacements started catching on fire. Meanwhile, Google's other rival in the mobile world — Apple — has been dogged by complaints that it is lagging in innovation. Many analysts who expressed that concern were not soothed by the latest iPhone, which took some small steps forward but also controversially ditched the headphone jack. Google went out of its way to mock the iPhone when it introduced the $769 Pixel, noting that it's brand-new smartphone is cutting edge but retains its headphone jack. Google even bragged about its new shade of blue for its smartphone, which could be read as a parody of Apple's genuine excitement over its new shade of black. But Samsung's slide, and the damage from its horrendous Galaxy Note 7 launch is perhaps an even greater gift to Google. Many people have turned to Samsung phones as the anti-iPhone preference of choice. With customers admitting they're getting wary about other models of Samsung phones — despite the fact that none have had problems anywhere near the scale as the Note 7 — Google's Pixel fits neatly into whatever gap Samsung leaves behind. Compounding those woes even more is the Galaxy battery fires are happening right before the holidays when smartphone companies do their best business. "I think Samsung in their rush to get out the next product obviously didn’t study it well enough and now they are suffering the consequences of that lack of care," said Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-area telecommunications analyst, in an e-mail. "This is devastating to Samsung and will continue to be devastating to Samsung." While Samsung initially reported that the vast majority of Note 7 customers who traded in their phones were choosing another Samsung phone, anecdotal reports online indicate that is no longer the case. In fact, AT&T and T-Mobile said they were going to stop exchanging the Note 7 phones even before Samsung confirmed that it was halting all production of the phone. Even Samsung said it can't fault them for that decision, in light of the scattered reports that the replacement phones are suffering from the same heat problems as the faulty phones they replaced. “We recognize that carrier partners have stopped sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7 in response to reports of heat damage issues, and we respect their decision," Samsung said in a statement.  There's no guarantee Google will be able to swoop in and fill the gap completely. The Pixel phones are only available through Verizon, unless shoppers want to pay the full price for an unlocked version on Google's own store. Verizon is the nation's largest carrier, but the exclusive arrangement may limit sales. Still, even if Google's own phone doesn't manage to be the iPhone alternative of the holiday season, the company will still likely see other Android manufacturers get a boost through the end of the year. "While this is terrible news for Samsung, it may be great news for their competitors," Kagan said. "LG, Moto, Huawei and many other Android smartphones will quickly fill the gap left by this Samsung problem."

Microsoft creates a successful strategy called "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" and then promptly forgets it, resulting in a string of failures. Google, which up to now seemed happy to repeat Microsoft's mistakes, accidentally picks up a successful Microsoft practice and uses it against Apple -- likely taking out a number of its Android partners in the process. I'll share some thoughts on the impact of Google's Pixel phone and related product strategy in the context of Embrace, Extend, Extinguish, and why this doesn't bode well for Apple, and then close with my product of the week. The Most Powerful Forgotten Strategy In Tech Back when Microsoft was starting out, its most powerful platform wasn't Windows, which was almost an industry joke at the time -- it was Microsoft Office. The purpose of Microsoft Office was to take out Lotus 1-2-3, which was one of the most successful PC applications of its time. Microsoft brilliantly figured out that to remove Lotus it first had to embrace what made the product unique, which meant it not only had to load Lotus 1-2-3 files, but also to run the complicated macros that came with them. So Microsoft created Excel, and it was as close as you could get to Lotus 1-2-3 without being a copy of the product. That made it easy for people to switch. Then Microsoft extended the offering with word processing, a basic database offering, and eventually a presentation product. It priced the package competitively against Lotus 1-2-3, and that motivated people to switch. You see, it's not enough to make an offering as good and as easy to get to as the competition -- you still have to motivate folks to switch. Finally, Microsoft coupled the competitive edge it had gained with enterprise discounts and incentives, heavy marketing, and heavy advocacy to become the standard in office productivity packages. It extinguished Lotus and Lotus Notes in the segment, and Symphony -- the much-too-late response to Office -- failed in market. Microsoft used a shorter but very similar strategy against OS/2, which helped wipe it out of the market as well. It didn't use the same strategy with Zune (it just didn't execute) or its mobile phones, and those efforts failed. Pixel Phone: Embrace + Extend With Android phones, the embrace phase came early on. Android was about as close to a clone of iOS as an operating system could get. It wouldn't run iOS apps, but Android attacted most of the same developers, who developed on both platforms, which reduced the switching cost substantially. However, Google seemed to stall there for some time. It just kicked off the extend part of the strategy with the new Pixel phone, which not only adds a host of impressive additional capabilities, but also ties into Google's emerging IoT strategy. You can get a phone that's priced less than the new iPhones with a better camera, far faster charging, better performance on paper (waiting on reviews), and a far more useful digital assistant. However, the real extension is the growing host of products Google has integrated, including an Amazon Echo-like offering, a relatively unique smart router, an updated TV offering, a growing list of Nest devices, and a new VR headset. Granted, these products mostly will work with iOS devices as well, but they'll undoubtedly work better with Android phones, and some will work best or only with the Pixel. That makes the Pixel more attractive than the iPhone and motivates people to migrate to it. Extinguishing the iPhone Google already is pricing the Pixel at less than the iPhone, but Apple customers are exceedingly loyal to their company. However, Apple clearly has been cutting the cost of manufacturing its product while holding the price constant, and the user experience has been degrading as a result. All it would take would be a substantial number of Apple users seeing this cost-cutting as taking advantage of them, and if Google could give them a voice, then they likely could cause a stampede away from the platform. That is where Google Search likely comes in. Donald Trump recently accused Google of altering its search technology to favor Hillary Clinton (echoing a claim that surfaced this summer). You'd likely be able to toss this out, except the EU has accused Google of manipulating its search tech to favor its own offerings over those of competitors, and it is considering the imposition of historic fines against the company as a result. That's enough smoke to suggest there really is a fire, given the level of EU interest. In the end, the combination of a very strong product that more than matched the iPhone 7 (which is being pounded for its lack of headphone jack rather than praised for its solid advances), a massively growing ecosystem of products, unique technical enhancements (even I'm interested in a phone that will charge to 7 hours in 15 minutes), and the most powerful manipulation tool on the planet (Google Search) adds up to the potential to eliminate the iPhone. Granted, Google still would need to execute, and it has the attention span of a 4-year-old on sugar, but all of the ingredients to take out the iPhone are there. Wrapping Up: Embrace, Extend, Goodbye iPhone This is the first time that a firm has put together all of the elements of an Embrace, Extend, Extinguish strategy since Microsoft introduced in the 1990s. As always, the success of this strategy hinges on the firm's willingness to execute, but it does represent the most powerful threat to Apple's iPhone yet. That said, the part not yet addressed is what happens to the other Android phones. The low-end phones likely are safe, as this is clearly a high-end offering, and most can't afford it. However, given its massive phone problems at the high end, Samsung in particular should be concerned. Long before Google's Pixel takes a big chunk out of Apple, it is likely to take an even bigger chunk out of the other high-end Android phones. To them, this is Microsoft Surface on steroids, and Microsoft pretty much cornered the market on Windows tablets with that offering. Yes, Google definitely will hurt Apple, but it may wipe out a few of its Android phone partners long before Apple feels a pinch. There could really be no other choice this week. I just saw 15-minute charge for 7 hours of battery life (total battery life around 13 hours), and I instantly fell in love. Granted, given Samsung's battery problems, I wouldn't want to be the first one with this phone -- it would be kind of embarrassing to have an airline tell you that you couldn't use it anywhere near an airplane -- but once vetted, this appears to be an impressive bit of kit. Google Pixel It has arguably the best camera in market, and it actually has a headphone jack -- who knew that would be so important? It has Qualcomm's very impressive quad-core Snapdragon 821 processor, a gorgeous FHD or QHD AMOLED screen wrapped with Gorilla Glass 4, a glass aluminum case, and MIMO support for stunning, cutting-edge WiFi performance (though it will require a MIMO router). Among the phone's downsides are that it isn't highly water resistant (it will stand up to sprays of water), and presently it runs only on the Verizon network in the U.S. Given the carrier issue and the fact that it is a brand new and as-yet-untested phone, I will wait to buy it -- but for that 15 minutes to 7 hours charge time, the Google Pixel Phone -- and particularly the XL version -- is my product of the week.

During the event, Apple VP of product marketing Susan Prescott announced a major update to iWork — a significant foray into the enterprise.  Apple’s iWork applications (including Pages, Numbers and Keynote) now enable real-time collaboration, a game-changing move that makes Apple products far more relevant for the digital workforce and pits it squarely against Google G Suite.  But will Apple’s bid to become an enterprise collaboration provider prove successful? What It Will Take for Apple to Compete in Collaboration Enterprise collaboration doesn't just mean sharing documents.  The projects and files that professionals collaborate on is the digital core of their business, and services like Google Drive become the foundation for all of a company’s daily activities.  From that perspective, choosing a collaboration solution is a major business decision. If Apple wants to become a platform of choice for enterprise audiences, it will need to prove its ability to support corporate needs. Enterprises run on ecosystems, which means integrations are key to the success of any company making business software. For a networked enterprise, collaboration means being able to work with customers, partners and other external organizations, as well as internal systems.  A large part of Google’s success thus far is because of its universal accessibility. If Apple wants to truly compete, it will need to support the software that business people already rely on and give them the flexibility to interact with other solutions and aspects of the collaboration ecosystem. In Enterprise Collaboration, Value Comes From Accessibility One of the most important assets of any collaborative platform is its universal accessibility: its ability to facilitate work between co-workers, customers and partners. This is especially important for businesses that regularly interact with their customers.  When collaborating externally, enterprises need to make the customer experience as seamless as possible, which often means working with customers on their terms. Forrester predicts that within the next few years customer-activated communication and collaboration (CACC) (paywall) will replace traditional unified communications and traditional internal collaboration strategies as the “glue” for customer experience.  Allowing customers to dictate their technology of choice helps companies address their needs as painlessly as possible. If iWork fails to integrate with other solutions, companies who rely on it will risk alienating their customer base — a risk not many will be willing to take. Other collaboration platforms have already grasped this. Integrations make shifting between Google G Suite, Box, Dropbox and Huddle frictionless for customers.  These ostensibly competitive solutions support one another because doing so enables users to interact with their customers more easily — which drives success of the entire ecosystem. Apple hasn’t always played nicely with its competitors.  Its products’ incompatibility with various popular software and services (such as Adobe Flash) have been notoriously frustrating for consumers, though never particularly devastating for the brand.  Enterprise audiences, however, won’t afford the company the same flexibility. Big businesses aren’t willing to ostracize customers or partners — nor will they be willing to abandon their existing IT solutions, which many companies have invested in heavily and rely on for business processes. The Evolving Function of Collaboration Technology IDC anticipates that the enterprise collaboration market will grow to $6.2 billion by 2019. The reason for the uptick is largely due to the shifting role of collaboration software, which has evolved to become a foundation for business operations.  Companies have started building processes around their collaboration solution, and many have invested significant resources into building these programs.  A recent Accenture study found that companies that build digital collaboration into their business processes save millions of dollars a year. A subsequent McKinsey survey found that companies using this networked approach improve customer and partner benefits by 600 percent. The number of enterprises taking this approach is climbing steadily every year.  Given the amount of dependency companies have on their existing collaboration platforms, iWork will find the most success by supplementing these platforms, becoming a welcome addition to the enterprise ecosystem. The Collaboration Industry Must ... Collaborate Faced with the challenge of maintaining its staggering growth, Apple has already made the enterprise a key area for market expansion.  In recent years, Apple has announced new partnerships with Cisco and IBM to make the proliferation of its devices grow among enterprise customers. These partnerships appear to lay the foundation for an Apple strategy that embraces the open ecosystem of enterprise collaboration. The company has also demonstrated its willingness to support outside services by increasing compatibility with other business software. In an interview last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “We've turned up the volume on collaboration ... because it's so clear that in order for us to be incredibly successful we have to be the best collaborators in the world. The magic of Apple, from a product point of view, happens at this intersection of hardware, software and services. “  If Apple advances that drive to collaborate externally as well as internally, there might just be a place for the consumer giant in the enterprise after all.

Naiknaware, 13, finished in the top eight in an international science contest run by Google, won a $15,000 scholarship, a free trip to the Lego world headquarters in Denmark and a year's worth of entrepreneurship mentoring from a Lego executive. (Ravi Kaiknaware via AP) Previous Next PORTLAND, Ore. –  An Oregon teenager has invented a bandage that can tell doctors when it needs to be changed, impressing Google judges and securing a $15,000 scholarship. Anushka Naiknaware, 13, placed in the top eight in an international science contest run by Google. She won the Lego Education Builder Award, which included the scholarship, a free trip to Lego world headquarters in Denmark and a year of entrepreneurship mentoring from a Lego executive, reported the Oregonian/OregonLive. Large wounds must be kept moist to promote healing, but changing bandages too often to check moisture levels can make things worse. To solve that problem, Naiknaware, a seventh-grader at Stoller Middle School in Portland, designed and tested a bandage that is embedded with tiny monitors. They can sense moisture levels and allow medical workers to determine whether the dressing has dried out enough that the bandage needs to be changed. Naiknaware created the sensors by printing a fractal pattern using ink containing graphene nanoparticles. The particles can accurately detect when moisture levels have dropped. More on this...

Naiknaware was the youngest person to win one of the global prizes. She told the Oregonian that being able to interact, debate and play with 19 other curious teen scientists from across the world was one of her favorite life experiences. Another, she said, was the moment she saw her bandage prototype work. "My idea became a physical, tangible reality," said Naiknaware. She said she hopes to use her Lego mentor's advice to figure out how to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for her bandages so a company can produce them at scale. ___ Information from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com Advertisement Trending in Health 1 Dr. Manny: How Newt Gingrich may help shape Trump's health care plan 2 Dr. Manny: Trump can revolutionize health care for America 3 Company strives to provide eye care for underserved global communities 4 12 ways to manage diabetes during pregnancy 5 How to get rid of canker sores and prevent them from coming back See all Trends Top Health Centers View All Back Pain Cancer Depression Heart Disease Pain Management Sexual Health Beauty & Skin Cold and Flu Digestive Health Nutrition Pregnancy Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Trending Newsletters Alerts Blogs Mobile Podcasts Radio Fox News Store Apps & Downloads About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Contact Us Email Newsroom FAQ Media Relations Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2016 FOX News Network, LLC.

SUBSCRIBE Does finding that micro-moment feel like chasing fireflies? Here are 9 data points that will help you catch them. Consumers are searching, doing and buying on their mobile devices, yet the challenge to reach them seems greater than ever. Columnist Wesley Young of the Local Search Association takes a look at 9 stats that suggest ways to improve your capture rate. Wesley Young on October 10, 2016 at 11:35 am More Getting the attention of today’s consumer is harder than ever before. They are on multiple devices, accessing numerous forms of media. Their paths to purchase are as varied as flavors of ice cream. And many use ad-blocking technology to run from attempts to reach them. It’s like chasing fireflies that light up and disappear in the dark just as you swing your net. This is a reality that won’t be changing anytime soon. As consumers’ digital experiences are increasingly interrupted by pop-up ads, pre-roll videos and banners that obscure their view, ads and unsolicited content seem to generate more irritation than interest. While more are trying to improve marketing and ROI through targeting, that still doesn’t always solve the problem of timing (i.e., serving up the content at the right moment). The ultimate goal is not just to serve up an ad or coupon to the right person, but also to time it to the moment when that information is needed or desired. Google coined the term “micro-moment” to capture that instant when a person is open to discovery — looking for information or searching for products or services. Micro-moments, according to Google Google VP of Marketing Lisa Gevelber, who conceived the micro-moments concept, explained that in today’s mobile climate, “intent is more important than identity and demographics, and immediacy is more important than brand loyalty.” Google has identified four distinct moments every marketer should know: I-want-to-know moments I-want-to-go moments I-want-to-do moments I-want-to-buy moments Each represents a distinct consumer action, and together they cover the full range of user needs across all stages of the consumer journey. Graphic from Google’s “Micro-Moments: Your Guide to Winning the Shift to Mobile“ The challenge and potential return of micro-moments With micro-moments by definition being short, and the amount of data required to predict when they might occur seemingly voluminous, it’s clear that companies struggle with trying to manage the concept. Forrester reports that only 26 percent of marketers have the data and analytics necessary to identify customers’ moments of need. Only 27 percent have a system in place that can effectively deliver ads or marketing when the moment is identified, and just nine percent can measure them.  Combined, that means only two percent of marketers have all the necessary pieces in place to fully take advantage of the micro-moment. Yet having even some pieces in place can be very profitable. That same Forrester report states that just being able to identify micro-moments makes it 65 percent more likely a marketer will report very profitable mobile ROI. Having an infrastructure to deliver on moments of intent makes it 33 percent more likely, and measuring moments with analytics tools makes it 43 percent more likely. These micro-moments are also great equalizers for local businesses. According to Google, 65 percent of smartphone users look for the most relevant information, regardless of company or provider, which levels the playing field for local businesses that compete with more recognizable brands. Capturing those micro-moments may seem to local businesses like trying to create the perfect storm. But being aware of some consumer behavior and utilizing new technologies can help you get there. Following are nine data points and corresponding tips that may help you adjust your local search and marketing strategy to take advantage of the consumer shift to micro-moments and boost your ROI. 1. 33% of mobile users switch to a competitor who provides helpful information Draft content that helps consumers make decisions. The internet has changed the way we think. As the volume of information increases exponentially, and access becomes easier, we no longer retain information in our memory as before. According to research covered by Harvard Magazine, instead of remembering the content itself, we’ve adjusted to remembering where to find it. In other words, we search for it online, using search terms and platforms where we believe the answer lies. But those who have trouble remembering distinct facts may struggle to use those facts in critical thinking (like decision-making). Today, consumers rely more on content found to provide relevant information that will help them make decisions, which means they go into the process with less bias. That is reflected in statistics from Google that 51 percent of smartphone users have discovered a new company or product when conducting a search on their smartphone — and that one in three users purchased from a company or brand other than the one they intended to after discovering information in the moment they needed it. Further, 69 percent of users are more likely to buy from companies that help them easily find answers to their questions. So, create content that is helpful or educational and that answers questions consumers may have about your product or service. Address attributes that consumers shop for — such as functionality, durability and expertise — and use anecdotes and images to illustrate the quality of your product or service.  Reference or incorporate reviews into your content that others have voted as being helpful to their decision-making process. For example, in response to a search for “best sounding acoustic guitar strings,” an article that compares the various types of strings, the materials they are made of and the pros and cons of each will both attract an interested buyer and help him or her make a decision. Having a link to your related product page or prices and an add-to-cart button will assist with converting that lead into a sale. And use different forms of media designed to be informative. Videos, blogs or articles all are ways to serve informative content, and they can include a call to action to contact, visit or buy from you. 2. 43% of consumers ignore companies that serve irrelevant content Customize relevant search results with local inventory ads. The opposite is also true — unhelpful content is bypassed or can even have negative returns. Consumers just don’t like content that isn’t relevant to what they are looking for. In a survey by Gigya, 67 percent of consumers unsubscribed from email lists when targeted with irrelevant emails, and 43 percent ignored future communications from the company. Thirty-two percent went further and boycotted the company’s sites or apps, and 20 percent stopped buying from the company. Graphic — LSA Insights Paid search, with its ability to respond to high-intent keywords, is great for identifying micro-moments and consumer needs. But the opportunity is wasted if intent-responsive content isn’t served in return. There are some services that can tolerate a single ad that is responsive to most or all searches. For example, a plumber might be able to have a single landing page that touts his or her excellent plumbing experience with reasonable prices, no matter whether the search is for water heater repair, leak detection, fixture installation or other plumbing services. However, if I search for “chew-proof dog beds,” I shouldn’t get the same landing page as when I search for “orthopedic dog bed for older dogs.” I also don’t want to see listings for or pictures of delicate, lacy, pillow-top dog beds. Google recognizes the explosion of such micro-moments happening on its search platforms, especially on mobile devices. Mobile shopping on Google increased by 30 percent in the last year; and in 2016, 34 percent of online retail purchases are made on mobile devices. Google’s response to requests from retailers for help with micro-moments? Local inventory ads. While it’s not a new service, Google has been working on improving local inventory ads. The ads allow brick-and-mortar stores that sell tangible goods to customize results by labeling each product with descriptive attributes. Those might include brand, size, color, material, pattern, pricing and a description of any other relevant attributes or special features. Google also recently added the ability for users to search an advertiser’s inventory in the local Knowledge Panel and include a store pick-up link. It has also expanded shopping ads to image search. The level of detail that may be added to the “product feed specification” provides rich information that will make results relevant and satisfy in-the-moment consumers. Facebook has launched its own version of local inventory ads, Dynamic Ads for Retail. With consumers spending more time on apps (such as Facebook’s) than ever before, this is a serious challenge to Google and an opportunity for local businesses. 3. Companies report over 2X CTR using custom audiences on Facebook Utilize the rich data of social media networks. Another way to meet consumers in the moment is to push unrequested marketing to them that is customized to their needs in the moment. The problem has always been having sufficient data to adequately identify the when and what of that push. But today, social media use captures rich data at an unprecedented depth that can help determine intent and vastly improve the relevance and timing of the push. Even smaller advertisers can leverage the immense resources and computing power of powerhouses like Facebook to identify and target those micro-moments. Not only does Facebook know its users’ demographics, it knows their interests, their behavior, what they like, what they don’t like, what affiliations they have, where they’ve been, what they’ve bought, what they do, what their tastes are, what’s important to them, life events that are happening, their stance on political issues, their income level and many other factors that can be profiled. Facebook also is expanding their Custom Audiences tool to use non-Facebook information to target consumers, as if it didn’t have enough on its own.  New targeting options include frequency of a particular behavior, time spent on content, date ranges of engagement, money spent and devices used. Reports regarding the success of customized targeting with Facebook data seem highly positive. Constant Contact reported a click-through-rate (CTR) of 2.5 percent for the targeted ads compared to 1.12 percent for all Facebook ads. And Kenshoo reported a CTR of 1.7 percent for dynamic ads on Facebook compared to 1.0 percent across all of its clients’ social network ads. 4. 18% decline in time spent per website visit in the past year Keep your content snackable. The internet affects another way we think. Our attention spans are shorter, and we ingest content in less depth. The Atlantic cites Maryanne Wolf, a developmental psychologist at Tufts University, explaining, “We are not only what we read, we are how we read.” And she recognizes that the style of reading of online content puts “efficiency” and “immediacy” above all else. The way we access online content on mobile devices is also affecting reading style. Google reports that 91 percent look up info while in the middle of a task, and 82 percent consult phones while standing in a store deciding what product to buy. Mobile phones allow us to look up anything at any time, and we’re squeezing more into shorter times and spare moments. For example, 69 percent of leisure travelers who are smartphone users search for travel ideas during spare moments. These shorter moments translate into the 18-percent decline Google reports on time spent per website visit this past year. It’s important that you keep information concise and highlight the most important information first. Use headings, lists and bullet points to break up lengthier content, and incorporate graphics when you can to convey information visually and quickly. Also, segregate or categorize content that can be accessed more directly, and label sitemap sidebars and navigational links clearly so that users can easily find information they need. 5. 70% of consumers who abandon websites do so because it takes too long to load Make sure your content is served quickly. Those micro-moments are short, and they need to be sweet. That snackable content needs to be served quickly. Consumers today are in a rush, with 40 percent saying they are always or usually in a hurry when looking for instructions on mobile and over 33 percent saying they are in a rush when searching for a local business. As a result, most of those who abandon websites (70 percent) do so because it takes too long to load, according to Google. Thirty-three percent of all mobile shoppers head to a competitor if they have a negative mobile shopping experience, which might be page speed or poor mobile design. Thus, it’s critical to make sure your mobile site is fast and provides a seamless experience. How long is too long for a mobile website to load? Several years ago, it was reported that 40 percent abandon a mobile site if it takes more than three seconds to load. I’d expect that consumer patience is even shorter today. Yet in 2013, the top 100 retail mobile site load time was 4.33 seconds, and it’s actually getting slower. The number increased to 5.5 seconds in 2015 due to heavier content such as video, heavy fonts and other weighty formats. Check out those numbers and some tips to improve performance using new formats and by removing speed-killing weight here. 6. Offline conversions get up to a 79% lift by using programmatic advertising Categorize your data so you can use programmatic ads to capture micro-moments and focus on end of funnel strategies. I reported on a study by Accordant Media on LSA’s (Local Search Association) blog that showed programmatic advertising overall provided a boost to offline sales. Overall, the campaign resulted in an incremental increase of 35 percent more offline sales, representing a 55-percent lift in conversion rate. In the transaction phase, however, those numbers were 44-percent incremental increase and 79-percent lift. Programmatic advertising seems built for our micro-moments society in which ads can be served instantaneously in response to specific conditions or user activity. This is reflected by the increase in volume of “trading” in the programmatic marketplace by over 150 percent in just the last year. In order to take advantage of programmatic advertising (and many other targeting strategies that help find consumers in those micro-moments), local businesses need to analyze and categorize their customers by those filters used in these platforms. Some broad targeting categories within which there will be a number of specific data filters include site visitation data such as keywords, interest or lifestyle data, behavior, geography and demographics. When properly targeted, the data shows users will visit offline stores and buy at offline locations as a result of these online moments. Red Roof Inn executed this perfectly; it was able to track real-time flight delays that triggered targeted search ads to stranded passengers looking for accommodations. That campaign resulted in a 60-percent increase in bookings across non-branded search campaigns. 7.  58% of mobile users are more likely to buy if they can do so quickly Make sure calls to action are seamless. Amazon recognized early that friction in the checkout and payment process was contributing to the approximately 70-percent cart abandonment rate. It was granted a patent for its 1-Click transaction concept using stored customer credentials to immediately complete a purchase. That concept facilitates an estimated billions of dollars’ worth of annual revenue. Apple felt it was important enough to license and pay for Amazon’s patented idea, allowing its users to instantly download a song on iTunes and make purchases from its App Store. The patent expires in 2017, so that technology will be readily available to local businesses through third-party providers that design their own single-click platforms. Yet it is important even before then for local businesses to find other ways to make the checkout process seamless — Google found that 58 percent of mobile users are more likely to buy if they can do so quickly. Further, the idea can be applied to many other calls to action. Making action easy and instant will boost engagement, traffic and sales. So find ways to reduce friction for actions such as click to call, click to text, directions, bookings, reservations and appointments and other actions that a consumer might take. 8. 35% of Amazon’s revenue comes from product recommendations Invest in high-ROI retargeting. Another Amazon boon is product recommendations. McKinsey reports that Amazon attributes 35 percent of its revenue to recommendations, while Netflix reports that 75 percent of what subscribers watch comes from product recommendations. Other retargeting or predictive marketing includes follow-up from the aforementioned abandoned carts and dynamic ads that retarget users triggered by expressed interest from search, clicks and other intent-based action. ROI numbers like those of Amazon and Netflix have some analysts forecasting widespread adoption of predictive marketing — and technology is making such predictive marketing more accessible to small businesses. Google’s local inventory ads and Facebook’s newly launched competing product, dynamic ads for retail, both accommodate predictive marketing. 9.  50% of local visits are made within 24 hours after local search Keep your retargeting timeline short. While retargeting is effective, I’m sure we’ve all experienced being retargeted long after we’ve already made a decision or a purchase. Micro-moments compress the times between exploration, search, discovery and conversion. Today, Google reports 60 percent of users make purchase decisions more quickly now than they did a few years ago, and 50 percent of local visits are made within 24 hours of a local search. Don’t waste your precious marketing dollars. Keep your retargeting efficient and your ROI positive by limiting the lifespan of a retargeted ad. Of course, the time will vary depending on the product or service. A search for “coffee shop near me” may have a window of 10 minutes; research for a big-ticket item like a car may have a window of several weeks. Final thoughts Micro-moments are here to stay. Those who figure out how to reach consumers at the moment in time when they are looking or doing, or going or buying and can provide helpful, relevant information within a fluid user experience will no doubt be successful.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:20 AM, October 11, 2016 BRUSSELS - EU regulators who are investigating whether Alphabet unit <GOOGL.O> Google is abusing its market power have has not extended their scrutiny to its tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the EU's antitrust chief said on Monday. Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple <AAPL.O> to pay up to 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in back taxes to Ireland and Starbucks <SBUX.O> up to 30 million euros to the Dutch tax office, said Google was not on her radar for now. "So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one," Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google's 130-million-pound ($160 million) back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticized as a derisory amount. Vestager also defended the slow pace of the Commission's antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010 when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday. "But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." Vestager said she did not know when she would issue a decision but the case was a very high priority for her. In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favoring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results. It has also been charged with blocking rivals in online search advertising and doing the same with dominant Android mobile operating system. The Commission has warned the company of hefty fines in both the shopping and Android cases and changes in its business practices if it is eventually found guilty of wrongdoing.

SUBSCRIBE Google puts RGB-Hex color converter in search results for “RGB to Hex” queries Often used for web design and graphic design work, an RGB color conversion tool determines exact color values. Amy Gesenhues on October 10, 2016 at 11:25 am More In a continued effort to keep more eyes on itself, Google is pointing their efforts toward web designers by placing an RGB-Hex color converter at the top of search results for “RGB to Hex” queries. An RGB-Hex color converter is often used for web design and other graphic design work to determine exact color values. Spotted this weekend by the Android Police site, Google’s RGB-Hex conversion tool shows up for both desktop and mobile searches. It appears the tool only shows up for the exact “RGB to Hex” query. Searches for “RGB-Hex color conversion” and other variations like “convert RGB to Hex” — or even “Hex to RGB” — did not return the same result.

In a new paper, three Google researchers note that there is no existing way to ensure—as the White House calls it—“equal opportunity by design,” but they have an idea. “Despite the need, a vetted methodology in machine learning for preventing this kind of discrimination based on sensitive attributes has been lacking,” wrote Moritz Hardt, a research scientist with the Google Brain Team and co-author of the paper, in a blog post. Hardt throws out two seemingly intuitive approaches, “fairness through unawareness” and “demographic parity,” but dismisses them for their respective loopholes. By learning from the shortcomings of the aforementioned methods, the team came up with a new approach. The core concept is to not use “sensitive attributes”—race, gender, disability, or religion—so that “individuals who qualify for a desirable outcome should have an equal chance of being correctly classified for this outcome.” “We’ve proposed a methodology for measuring and preventing discrimination based on a set of sensitive attributes,” wrote Hardt, whose co-authors are his colleagues Eric Price and Nathan Srebro. “Our framework not only helps to scrutinize predictors to discover possible concerns. We also show how to adjust a given predictor so as to strike a better tradeoff between classification accuracy and non-discrimination if need be.” In the diagram above, dark dots represent people who would pay off a loan, and the light dots those who wouldn't. In an ideal world, we would work with statistics that cleanly separate categories as in the left example. Unfortunately, it is far more common to see the situation at the right, where the groups overlap. Photo: Google The researchers call this method of not including sensitive attributes equality of opportunity. “When implemented, our framework also improves incentives by shifting the cost of poor predictions from the individual to the decision maker, who can respond by investing in improved prediction accuracy,” wrote Hardt. “Perfect predictors always satisfy our notion, showing that the central goal of building more accurate predictors is well aligned with the goal of avoiding discrimination.” The equality of opportunity principle alone cannot solve discrimination in machine learning, as Google calls for a multidisciplinary approach. “This work is just one step in a long chain of research,” says Google. “Optimizing for equal opportunity is just one of many tools that can be used to improve machine learning systems—and mathematics alone is unlikely to lead to the best solutions. Attacking discrimination in machine learning will ultimately require a careful, multidisciplinary approach.” Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

 A former Facebook exec is now running the company taking on Google’s Android Matt Weinberger Oct. 10, 2016, 1:34 PM 4,795 facebook linkedin twitter email print Cyanogen CEO Lior Tal LinkedIn Cyanogen, a well-funded startup creating an alternative version of Google's Android, has shaken up its executive team just a few months after laying off 20% of its workforce amid a strategy refocusing. Lior Tal, a former Facebook executive who joined Cyanogen as its Chief Operating Officer since June 2016, has been promoted to CEO. Former Cyanogen CEO and cofounder Kirt McMaster will be staying on as Executive Chairman of the Board.  Under Tal, Cyanogen will shift its attention away from what had been its core business and towards the company's ambitious longer-term vision. Where before the company had built its business on CyanogenMod, a customized version of Android that doesn't rely on Google's services, the company will now focus in the "short term" on a new "Modular OS" strategy that will let phone manufacturers build pieces of Cyanogen technologies into Android itself, Tal tells Business Insider. It's a stark contrast to Cyanogen's roots as a company that saw its mission as "[taking] Android away from Google." But from Tal's perspective, it would be folly to ignore the fact that Android is the most popular operating system in the world, no matter how much competitors may wish it weren't so. "Android is this huge continent that everyone lives on," Tal says. "That's just how it is." Cyanogen has raised $185 million in funding from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Rupert Murdoch. And while it's had some limited success partnering with companies like OnePlus to preinstall its operating system on new phones, and a close relationship with Microsoft, manufacturers were hesitant to ditch Android entirely for fear of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Modular From Tal's perspective, the "Modular OS" play is a necessary step to achieve the proper scale for the business, without sacrificing the goal of improving Android — even if it means that it won't focus as heavily on building a "full-stack" operating system for a while. Indeed, it's a reconciliation of Cyanogen's "rebellious child" hacker spirit with its need to grow as a business, Tal says. They can keep working on improving Android, without having to worry so much about chipping away at its titanic market share. Cyanogen Executive Chairman and Founder Kirt McMaster Flickr / Web Summit "I think we can achieve the same mission within Android today," Tal says. All or nothing By providing its tech as a series of modular pieces, it means phone manufacturers can combine the bits of Cyanogen they like with the bits of Android they like. That potentially opens the door to new partners who may have been shy about looking at Cyanogen, which in turn could mean more money for the company.  "You don't have to take all or nothing," Tal says. Johan Larson via Flickr McMaster says that it's a new challenge that Tal is uniquely qualified to meet: In 2011, he sold his startup Snaptu to Facebook for an estimated $60-70 million. Snaptu provided a bundle of customized, low-bandwidth apps to smartphone manufacturers in the developing world. That technology is the cornerstone of Facebook Lite, one of the social network's main efforts to connect emerging markets to the web. Plus, McMaster says, by putting Cyanogen's technology into more phones and tablets everywhere, it builds out the company's master plan of building out its artificial intelligence capabilities, meaning any phone manufacturer would ba able to take advantage of Google-like AI without needing to incorporate Google tech. "He's the guy to take this to the next level now," McMaster says.   SEE ALSO: Cyanogen CEO on layoffs: We're not pivoting and we're stronger than ever NOW WATCH: 5 wild uses for your old Android smartphone Loading video...

FCA Google is adding some Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to its test fleet of autonomous vehicles. Wheego A Wheego EV, based on a Smart Car. As long as it ditches that terrible semiautomatic gearbox it's bound to be an improvement on the original! Baidu Baidu was granted a self-driving test permit at the end of August. It appears the roads of California are about to get even more crowded with self-driving cars. The Wall Street Journal reports that Valeo (a tier-one supplier to the auto industry) and Wheego (an electric vehicle powertrain engineering company) have each been granted permits by the state's DMV to begin testing a single autonomous vehicle on public roads. And over at electrek, there are some grainy spy shots of Google's new fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans, the first fruits of Google's partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. By being one of the first states in the nation to allow for the testing of autonomous vehicles on its roads, California has become quite the hotbed for self-driving car research. The addition of Wheego and Valeo now brings the total number of testing permits issued up to 17. At the end of the summer, Chinese tech firm Baidu gained permission to begin testing autonomous vehicles in the state as well. Those tests appear to be going quite well as of late. As part of the conditions of being granted an autonomous vehicle testing permit, each company must report any accidents to the DMV along with a report of what happened. In the past two years, only 19 such incidents have occurred, the most recent happening at the beginning of September 2016 when a Google test vehicle was rear-ended by a human driver. California isn't the only state in the country to allow for autonomous vehicle testing, however. Pittsburgh is the home of Uber's Advanced Technology Center, and the ride-sharing company has even begun using self-driving vehicles to ferry customers around. According to Quartz, that process has not been entirely problem-free. The news outlet has reported a few minor accidents and at least one case of an Uber test vehicle driving the wrong way up a one-way street. On Monday, HERE (the mapping company now owned by Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz) and the Iowa Department of Transportation announced their own project to develop an autonomous vehicle and freight movement corridor on I-380 between Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. Outside of these areas, the rest of us will probably have to wait another few years before we get to ride in driverless vehicles. 2021 has been set as a target for autonomous ride-sharing cars by a number of companies, including Ford and BMW. Listing image by FCA Expand full story Promoted Comments demonbug Ars Centurion jump to post The direct link to the DMV incident report page doesn't look like it works, you have to go here and then click on the link for Autonomous Vehicle Accident Reports (even though the URL is correct). Interesting that the last two incidents were the same situation at the same intersection. Sounds like maybe even if the Google car is behaving the way it should, it is doing something that drivers don't expect. Maybe being exceptionally conservative in waiting for cross traffic, or fooling people into thinking it is going to make the right turn as it creeps forward and abruptly stops? 203 posts | registered 7/30/2010 Reader comments You must login or create an account to comment.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us System images for the Google Pixel, Pixel XL leaked By John Hoff - October 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Well that did not take long at all. We’ve just had Google launch their new smartphones in the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL, and just barely a week after, we have a leak of the system images – which of course contains all the working software for both the Pixel and the Pixel XL – in our hands. This was leaked by serial leakster LlabTooFeR, source of many high profile leaks before. He swears that these system images will be the final builds mounted on the Pixel and the Pixel XL when they start shipping. Of course testing these images is another matter altogether, since we don’t even have hardware which these images will run on. LlabTooFeR says that these images are for “developers only, as you cannot install them on any existing devices.” That is one hundred percent true, of course. But that doesn’t mean that this leak is totally useless. Developers will be able to start ripping system apps and trying to port them to other devices. They will also be able to start studying how the new APIs work, and then maybe update their apps so that they will work with the Pixel and Pixel XL when these start shipping. If you are interested in these, check out the source link below. The links for downloading the images should be easy to find.

In some cases, even more significant savings could be observed. The improvements will make Chrome easier to use on low-end PCs. Chrome is known to be fairly resource-intensive, demanding more processor time and memory than rival browsers. Over the past year, Google has embarked on a major clean-up effort, bringing the sprawling browser into check and making it more accessible across the range of devices it's designed for. Last week, it detailed changes coming to Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine in December that will bring some much-needed improvements to the browser's memory management. Google has made a series of optimisations that have enabled it to dramatically cut Chrome's RAM requirements, creating a smoother experience on budget devices that have limited amounts of memory. The most noticeable improvements will be on websites that make heavy use of JavaScript. The usual candidates are modern sites and web-apps that have a lot of interactive elements such as video players, adverts and animated transition effects. The vast majority of websites now use JavaScript in some way. Chrome's sped-up processing reduces the time needed for this code to run, making the site more responsive and giving your computer some extra space to breathe. On its test sites, Google observed the new Chrome release using an average of 50 percent less RAM than the current stable version of the browser. It assessed JavaScript performance on a selection of the most popular websites, including YouTube, The New York Times and Reddit, to determine the scores. Not all sites will benefit from the changes in the same way. Many are unlikely to see tangible improvements but others could experience even greater reductions. When looking at the New York Times' mobile site, a 66 percent decrease in RAM usage was experienced. The improvements will make Chrome easier to use on devices that have limited memory. Tabbed browsing will also be faster while consuming less resources. A browser's memory usage can quickly increase once you've got a few tabs open, leaving your PC without enough RAM to handle other apps and services you might be using as well. Many low-end Windows devices have 1GB or 2GB of RAM. A 50 percent reduction in Chrome's usage will be especially noticeable to users of these tablets and laptops. The improvements will ship with Chrome 54, set to be released to the public on December 6th. If you want to reduce your device's RAM consumption today, you can switch to the Chrome Beta channel which already includes the new memory optimisations. Running pre-release software does come with risks though. You may face unexplainable bugs when using a beta release. Google plans to make further changes to Chrome's RAM management over the coming months, this time focusing on mobile devices. Chrome is used by millions of smartphone users each day on devices that may have as little as 512MB of RAM. Google's next round of improvements will target these devices, making mobile browsing less frustrating by boosting performance on modern sites.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion HTC Smartwatch Rumors, Leaked Photos and Specs: Is the Wearable Device Worthy to Compete with Other Smartwatches? By Neal A. Lasta Oct 10, 2016 | 10:18 AM HTC, the tech company based in Taiwan, will unveil the company's first ever Smartwatch product after releasing their flagship smartphone the HTC 10. The HTC 10 is actually one of the best smartphones this year, but unfortunately, the company isn't doing well in sales; at least relative to Apple, Samsung and other tech giants. Aside from the HTC 10 and the new smartwatch, HTC is also actually in charge of producing the new Google Pixel devices which are generating lots of buzz, with some fans calling it the iPhone killer. The HTC Smartwatch is codenamed Halfbeak, and has been in the rumor mill since two years ago. Back then, HTC was rumored to release a wearable device to match the Apple Watch. The HTC Smartwatch was involved in many rumors that point to delayed releases. It was previously suggested that this smart wearable will be released early in 2015, but that obviously didn't happen. With the released photos, however, the Smartwatch might become a reality sooner than later. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Leaked Photos A couple of photos of the HTC Smartwatch have been leaked through Weibo. The photos show HTC is joining Motorola, Huawei, LG and Samsung in creating devices running on Android Wear. HTC Smartwatch Features and Specs HTC's Smartwatch has long been in the rumors, but it's only been recently that a leak of the actual device in photos has been released. It is a circular watch with a metallic surface and a 360 x 360 resolution. At the back of the Smartwatch, the Under Armour logo could be seen on top, with the HTC logo at the bottom part. Under Armour is an accessories and sports clothing company which has recent ties with HTC. Under Armour also partnered with HTC over its first fitness wearable called Grip. Aside from the circular design, the Smartwatch also has a rubber or silicone band. This gives the watch a sporty look and provides evidence that the device is primarily targeted towards health and fitness enthusiasts. On the right side, two physical buttons can be seen. One of these buttons are probably the switch button to power on or off the HTC Smartwatch. At the back of the watch are pogo pins which may connect to a charging cradle. Some rumors also say that the device will have an AMOLED display, and have Android Wear for its operating system. Despite the leaked photos, nothing is ever certain until we hear from the company itself.

Samsung continues to experience problems with Galaxy Note7 batteries overheating, but Google's grand re-entrance into the smartphone market could be a bigger problem. By Conner Forrest | October 10, 2016, 8:04 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: CNET When it comes to smartphones, Samsung has a very public problem on its hands. Replacement Galaxy Note7 devices, exchanged for original models that overheated, have also begun catching catching fire and creating a plethora of problems for their users. In Kentucky, a man claimed that his replacement Galaxy Note7 caught fire while he was sleeping and caused him to seek medical help for smoke inhalation. Another replacement Note7 caught fire on a Southwest Airlines plane (also in Kentucky), which led to an evacuation of the entire flight. On Monday, Samsung officially confirmed that it would be suspending production of the devices until it could get the battery issue under control. This is after the US government issued its own formal recall of the devices in mid September. While some have called this issue a nightmare, and some carriers have considered ending sales of the device, a bigger threat to Samsung's dominance in the smartphone market is Google's Pixel Phone. SEE: BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy Template (Tech Pro Research) Make no mistake, the exploding battery problem is a serious issue, and Samsung must address it properly. However, if they do so, they should be able to survive what it has brought about. Even in recent history, there are a plethora of examples of major corporations dealing with critical issues brought about by their products. Exxon survived the Valdez oil spill and Ford survived exploding Pintos. Even Apple, one of Samsung's biggest competitors, made it through Antennagate and will likely make it through the controversy caused by its decision to eliminate the traditional headphone jack on the iPhone 7. According to research firm Gartner's latest numbers, Samsung holds 22.3% of the worldwide market share for smartphones. Since that number includes iOS and Windows, it would likely grow in the context of the Android market exclusively. And despite the problems caused by the Galaxy Note7, Samsung's stock recently hit an all-time high. Enter the Pixel A bigger problem in front of Samsung is Google's re-entering the smartphone market with its Google Pixel phone, announced on October 4, 2016. The Pixel phone presents an impressive feature set that could grab the attention of undecided users. The biggest issue, though, isn't about the hardware specs. Artificial intelligence (AI) could be the deciding factor for which company comes out on top, and the Pixel is predicated on that premise. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, went as far as to say that the next evolution of computing is moving from "mobile-first to AI-first," with its new Google Assistant. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter In giving initial feedback on the Pixel phone to TechRepublic's Brandon Vigliarolo, Gartner's Werner Goertz said that the announcement of the Pixel phone "was not about hardware in isolation, but how the portfolio of hardware devices fits into the delivery of Google Assistant, and this is where Pixel really shines." Here's the catch: Google may not necessarily be providing Google Assistant to all of its Android OEM partners. And even if it does, update complications may delay their ability to bring Google Assistant to market with their phones. Samsung recently acquired Viv Labs in order to build its own AI-powered conversational interfaces, but only time will tell if they stack up to the Google Assistant. Some analysts, like Gartner's Tuong Nguyen, have argued that the Pixel phone isn't a threat to Samsung. Google products aren't about selling massive volumes, and the Pixel phone is currently limited to Verizon, Nguyen said. So it may attract some Verizon Note7 users, but there are many other high-end options available right now from companies like LG and Huawei, and even other options from Samsung. "I don't think threat is the right word for this situation," Nguyen said. "It's one of the many devices that may benefit from Samsung's misfortunes, but it's not the single device/brand that will cause an impact on Samsung's sales/share—the Note 7 did this by itself without 'help' from the competition." The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Samsung Galaxy Note7 replacement devices began overheating recently, sending one man to the hospital and causing the evacuation of a Southwest Airlines plane. Despite its problems, Samsung maintains a strong market share and its stock price has risen to new heights even with the Galaxy Note7 debacle. Google's Pixel phone is a greater threat to Samsung's Android dominance because of its integration with Google Assistant and its top-shelf feature set.

The Celebrating Arabic Reading initiative is offering readers up to 90 per cent off online Arabic-language books in the Google Play Books store. The offer is valid in nine countries across the region, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and Chairman of Emirates Group, said the initiative aims to encourage more people to read Arabic content in digital form. "Smartphones and tablets are increasingly a part of our daily lives, so it makes perfect sense to promote reading on these new platforms as well," he said. "People are hungry for content, especially Arabic digital content, and there isn’t a smarter investment for the future of this region than providing access to e-books to broaden the horizons of millions." Ronan Harris, Google’s vice president for large customer sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa, said he hoped the partnership with Emirates would make reading Arabic literature more accessible and enjoyable. "There is so much opportunity to build the digital ecosystem here and we’re happy to have partners like Emirates make it happen," he said. The initiative, which is supporting the UAE’s Year of Reading campaign, is set to last through the month of October and is available on both iOS and Android platforms. newsdesk@thenational.ae Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related 2016 a ‘tough’ year says Emirates’ Tim Clark as Europe and Africa weigh on Dubai carrier Sharjah International Book Fair announces visiting authors for 2016 Parents show children importance of Arabic by taking lessons themselves Hundreds of Fujairah school pupils enter world of learning on book bus More UAE UAE diabetes cases rise by 35 per cent since 2014, experts say UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi Emiratis in the US urged to avoid political protests and conflict with ‘ignorant individuals’ Gargash: US’s role in the Gulf cannot be compromised by Trump presidency MOST VIEWED UAE | All UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Two Audi R8s are the latest added to Dubai Police’s supercar fleet Emiratis in the US urged to avoid political protests and conflict with ‘ignorant individuals’ Obaida’s killer tells Dubai court God is his lawyer Gargash: US’s role in the Gulf cannot be compromised by Trump presidency Abu Dhabi to Dubai in 12 minutes?

Picture: Beck Diefenbach San Francisco - Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available... GOOGLE Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets - aiming to outdo Apple's Siri - enabling users to organise and use information on the devices and in the cloud - to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. SAMSUNG The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort to provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. AMAZON Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its “Alexa” artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called “Dot” and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. MICROSOFT Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name “Cortana” and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana - a name based on a character in its blockbuster game Halo - responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. FACEBOOK Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename “M”. The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of “Jarvis”, the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series Iron Man. For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered “bots” on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. APPLE Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with “Deep Blue” software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with “Watson” artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers. Thousands of people are expected to attend a World of Watson conference later this month in Las Vegas.

The shares, which spiked last month following speculation of a takeover by companies including Google, fell $2.82, or 14%, to $17.03 in early trading after Bloomberg reported that Twitter was unlikely to receive any takeover bids. Google owner Alphabet, Walt Disney and Silicon Valley tech firm Salesforce have all been working with investment banks on a potential acquisition of the 140-character service. But Bloomberg reported over the weekend that all of the firms had decided not to press ahead with a bid. How would Salesforce, Google and Disney benefit from buying Twitter? Read more Twitter’s shares already had fallen heavily at the end of last week after Silicon Valley technology news website Recode reported Google and Apple had decided against buying the company, which has been struggling to attract new users and build revenue. Twitter’s stock market decline brings the company’s share price back below the level it was trading at before the takeover speculation was first reported on 23 September. The social media company, which floated on the stock market in November 2013 at $26 a share and whose shares reached a high of $69 soon after, had hired Goldman Sachs Group and Allen & Co to investigate a sale. Twitter’s chief executive and co-founder Jack Dorsey was opposed to a sale, but fellow co-founder and board member Ev Williams supported it. The company is reported to have hoped to conclude a sale before it reported its third quarter results on 27 October. Salesforce had been seen as the most likely buyer as its chief executive Mark Benioff had publicly expressed his interest in Twitter. However, he appeared not to have sounded out his investors in advance. Benioff was forced onto the defensive at a shareholder meeting last week after many investors publicly and privately expressed their doubts about the deal. “I read all of your notes; you probably know that,” he said at the meeting in San Francisco. “I also read your emails. And as I digest all of that information, this is actually the No 1 thing that has been on my mind. In some cases we have been unusually surprised and we have had to do a reset.” Salesforce’s shares, which had been depressed following the Twitter acquisition speculation, rose by 5.4% to $74.70 on Monday – taking them back to roughly the level they were at before the takeover talk was first reported.

"When it comes to Google trends, we are seeing a great number of individuals heading to the web to become more informed," he said. "The tie-in searches proves that many still want to know why Mr. Trump and Secretary Clinton are criticized from comments about women and what happened in Benghazi, respectively."

"Viewers wanted to see and hear his further reaction to those statements and how Secretary Clinton would respond," said Mollica.  "This debate had the makings of one that would see strong reactions. Twitter echoed that sentiment last night."

Skip to content Double Jump A blog run by two geeky sisters sharing their love for video games. Menu Home About Us Contact Us HomeVR Pitfalls VR Pitfalls October 10, 2016October 10, 2016 Kris P. Home, Kristengames, google, headsets, pitfalls, pixel, video games, virtual reality Happy Monday, folks! Talking again about virtual reality, this post is mainly about my reservations about this section of the video game market. Virtual reality is amazing, but there is definitely room for improvement… Google has joined the smart phone race with their new Pixel phone. I think it looks pretty good, and I’m not ruling it out the next time I need to upgrade my phone, but I also realized that Google has a VR headset — called Daydream — to go with the Pixel. It made me realize that there’s quite a few VR sets out there on the market. The Vive, the Playstation VR, Samsung Gear VR, Google’s Daydream… As a kid, virtual reality was a distant dream. Now, we suddenly have all these options, all these companies vying for a piece of the action. Virtual Reality headsets are, more or less, special goggles that go right in front of your eyes. As a kid, Mom and Dad constantly told me not to sit so close to the television lest my eyes get ruined (and now I wear glasses for distance — coincidence?). The VR headsets just toss that piece of advice out the window. With that said, do these VR headsets have a time limit? Being immersed in a video game such as that for so long isn’t healthy at all. If the headsets have, say, an hour time limit, that may be good. Perhaps that’s why the Batman: Arkham VR is only about an hour long. The wires and set up can be dangerous as well. Virtual Reality games tend not to have the player move much, avoiding the danger of tripping over wires and speakers, but the immersion aspect is ruined. Maybe one day there will be a VR set that has a treadmill-like mat, one that allows the player to walk around in place. Overall, I would still love to try out virtual reality games, but I’m also eager to see how this particular corner of the video game market will improve over time.   Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Oct 10, 2016, 11:11am EDT share tweet Linkedin Last May, Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) signed a deal to make a fleet of self-driving Pacifica minivans — the first phase in a broader autonomous car deal between the two companies. On Sunday, the first prototypes were spotted in a San Francisco parking garage by the CEO of Enterprise Garage Consultancy, who sent some spy photos to Electrek. They show over a dozen plug-in hybrid Pacificas with cameras and LIDAR sensors mounted on their roofs. Google won’t say when it plans on deploying the minivans, or in what capacity. But it’s worth noting that the minivans were spotted around the same time that Google made two significant announcements: its self-driving Lexus SUVs have driven a combined 2 million miles on public roads; and the company is launching a new ride-sharing service centered on carpooling. You know what’s a good vehicle for carpooling? Minivans! You know what’s a good vehicle for carpooling? Minivans! (We’ve reached out to the Enterprise consultancy CEO for permission to use his photos, and will update this story when we hear back.) FCA’s chief, Sergio Marchionne, has made it clear he has grand plans for his company’s partnership with Google, but it’s not clear Google feels the same way, considering the deal is non-exclusive and the search giant has been on record about wanting to work with multiple manufacturing partners. It’s also up in the air how Google will make money from its self-driving efforts. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is close to spinning off its self-driving car division as a standalone business. And the project has lost much of its top talent, including chief technology officer Chris Urmson. Meanwhile, other companies have accelerated their self-driving efforts, including Uber, which launched a limited public run in Pittsburgh last month, and General Motors and Lyft, which have been testing driverless Chevy Bolts in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Arizona.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Access .onion Sites (Also Known as Tor Hidden Services) Website addresses that end in “.onion” aren’t like normal domain names, and you can’t access them with a normal web browser. Addresses that end with “.onion” point to Tor hidden services on the “deep web”. Warning: Lots of .onion sites contain very nasty things, and many of them are likely scams. We recommend staying away from “browsing” .onion sites–instead, use this only if you have a specific site you want to access for a good reason. What Is a .onion Site? RELATED ARTICLE How to Browse Anonymously With Tor Tor–short for “the onion router”–is an anonymizing computer network. It’s partially funded by the US government, and is designed to help people in countries where Internet access may be censored or monitored. When you connect to Tor, your internet activity is sent through the Tor network, anonymizing your Internet activity so it can’t be snooped on, and so that you can access websites that may be blocked in your country. So, when you access google.com through Tor, your request bounces from Tor relay to Tor relay before it reaches an “exit node”. That exit node then contacts Google.com for you, and it sends you back the data Google responded with. Google sees this as the exit node’s IP address contacting it instead of your IP address. RELATED ARTICLE Is Tor Really Anonymous and Secure? But that means that “last mile” of traffic can be snooped on by an organization monitoring or even running the exit nodes–especially if your traffic is unencrypted. A “.onion” address points to a Tor hidden service, which is a server you can only access through Tor. This means that your browsing activity can’t be snooped on by someone watching the Tor exit nodes. It also means that someone hosting a website can hide that server using the Tor network, so no one can find it–in theory. For example, Facebook maintains an official Tor hidden services address at “https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/”. This allows you to access Facebook through Tor, and your connection doesn’t ever leave Tor where it can be snooped on. This may be useful in countries that block Facebook, for example. You don’t necessarily want to use Tor all the time, as it’s slower than just browsing normally. But it’s a useful tool for anonymizing your Internet activity and bypassing censorship. How to Access .onion Sites with the Tor Browser To access a .onion address, you’ll need to access it through the Tor Browser. It’s a modified version of Firefox that’s configured to connect to sites through the Tor network. Download the Tor Browser from the Tor project’s website to continue. It’s available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. On Android phones and tablets, you can download the official Orbot proxy app or Orfox browser from Google Play. The Tor project offers no official Tor apps for iPhone or iPad. After launching the Tor browser, type the .onion address into its address bar. For example, to access Facebook’s hidden service, you’d enter the following address: https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/ Or, to access the DuckDuckGo search engine’s hidden service, you’d enter: http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ While using the Tor browser, you can click links to .onion addresses and they’ll load normally. But they’ll only work in the Tor browser, while connected to Tor. Don’t Access .onion Sites Through Proxies Like Tor2Web You can also access .onion sites without running Tor through proxies that connect to Tor for you. The proxy connects to Tor for you and then forwards you the traffic over the regular Internet. This, however, is a very bad idea! You’re losing the anonymity you normally have when you connect to a .onion site through the Tor browser. That’s the whole point of a .onion address, after all. The website you access maintains its anonymity, but someone monitoring your connection can see which website you’re connecting to. The service provider can also see what you’re connecting to and snoop on any passwords and other private information you provide over the connection. Tor2web functions in this way, but you shouldn’t use it. For example, if you attempt to connect to Facebook’s hidden service using Tor2web, Facebook blocks the connection and tells you it’s a bad idea. Looking for lists of .onion sites? Search the web for lists of .onion sites and you’ll find some places to start. Many of the directories of .onion sites are themselves stored on .onion sites, though, which you can only access through Tor. Again, beware: Lots of .onion sites contain very nasty things, and many of them are likely scams. We recommend staying away from them, if possible. This trick is best used when you want to browse to a specific .onion site.

Google hasn’t openly discussed how much it will spend on advertising the Pixel, but Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz recently told Reuters that the Pixel would have a very significant marketing campaign and that the tech giant may be buying ads during Thanksgiving football games. Those are some of the priciest ads in the business, going for upwards of $1 million dollars for 30 seconds of air time. Google isn’t the only company going all-in on the Pixel series, though. Carrier partner Verizon is also planning on investing a significant amount into advertising the new phones on TV, digital marketing, and social media. Verizon’s campaign won’t kick off until the phone officially launches on October 20th, but it will last through the holiday season, according to Verizon’s vice president of device marketing. local_offer    Google   Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (37) stars Further Reading The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again The Play Store sees another update Verizon launches BOGO deal Google starts selling OtterBox cases Exclusive: Project ARA specifications, design stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

MedpageToday savesaved by Larry Husten CardioBrief October 10, 2016 We may be close to peak hype and hubris in cardiology. This week some of the smartest people on the planet said that $75 million can help find new ways to prevent heart disease AND, as if that's not enough, completely reinvent the way we do science. On Wednesday Verily (Google's life science venture), the American Heart Association, and AstraZeneca announced the award of a single $75 million grant for "One Brave Idea" to Calum MacRae, chief of cardiology at Brigham & Women's Hospital. At an online press event Jessica Mega, chief medical officer of Verily (and, it probably should be noted, a former cardiologist at the Brigham) asked MacRae for his prediction of what he plans to achieve in 5 years. "I believe that we will have identified significant new pathways in coronary disease. I believe we will be moving toward a cure for those pathways and preventative strategies that apply to those. And above all I believe we will have completely reinvented the way of doing science in this space and I think that will be a major advance in itself," he responded. What Next? It's hard to know exactly how MacRae and his colleagues will be spending the $75 million or how they can hope to achieve their goals in 5 years. At the press announcement there was a lot of vague discussion about adopting the mentality of a startup company and learning to "fail fast." It's worth wondering about why an enormous grant devoted to innovation is going to the heart of traditional biomedical research. As the chief of cardiology at the Brigham and a Harvard faculty member MacRae and his colleagues are the establishment. MacRae said he wants to change the paradigm for the way biomedical research is funded and performed compared with traditional "ivory tower research." But of course he is a prominent occupant and defender of that same ivory tower. Dinosaurs, it should be pointed out, don't evolve into mammals. They go extinct. It also seems fair to wonder if $75 million is really enough, since, as MacRae acknowledged, they are going to be sorting through "almost an infinity of environmental exposures that we don't really know about" and which may turn out to be important. MacRae said the project would "separate signal from noise" by adopting a "rapid cycle" from identifying a signal to then testing it in large populations. But he didn't explain how his team -- previously associated with traditional -- and much slower -- research, will be able to speed this process up. Perhaps this project is just appropriating the language of Silicon Valley but really represents business as usual? During the press conference MacRae and the sponsors all agreed that there would be many failures along the way. But they never acknowledged even the possibility that the entire project might fail, which I would define as the absence of solid actionable findings that will lead to practical and demonstrably beneficial measures to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease. Further, they never even mentioned the possibility that a discovery may have a harmful effect. (Think, for instance, of the negative impact of aggressive screening of student athletes, which can end athletic careers and turn previously healthy young students into heart patients for life. Or think about the negative impact of widespread screening for prostate cancer.) And although $75 million seems like a lot, it's peanuts when compared with the NIH budget, or the Zuckerberg $3 billion gift to cure all disease by the end of the century (a perfect topic for another blog post), or the Obama/Biden cancer moonshot. But at least when it comes to hype it appears that Google, the AHA, and AstraZeneca got a lot of bang for their buck. The announcement on Wednesday prompted a lot of interesting comments on Twitter. I invited two active participants in the discussion to elaborate on their comments. Two Other Ideas Vinay Prasad, MD, of the Oregon Health and Sciences University: Right off the bat, one would think that a single payment of $75 million is unlikely to accomplish what billions of dollars in sustained NIH funding for cardiovascular research for decades has not. ... these sort of promises are unrealistic and frankly unhelpful for the public understanding of science. They are little more than a cheap PR stunt, which brings good press to the donors, but sets back the national discussion of sustainable, consistent funding. If the public thinks 75 million can seriously cure cardiovascular disease, then their desire to fight for federal funding may be diminished. The AHA notes that submission was initially limited to "one piece of paper." Which seems odd. If you are going to do something so unprecedented, and collect such a large sum of money to a single researcher, you would think you should have fleshed the idea beyond a sheet of paper. Next time, why not a cocktail napkin? The praise of the winning idea is as a "complete game changer," which will "disrupt the way science is discovered." These silicon valley buzzwords again are not very helpful to the public understanding of science. Interestingly, 350 people submitted ideas, meaning that each submission could have gotten $215,000 instead. Not a bad deal!! But, we know so little about optimal research funding, it would have been wonderful if these sponsors would conduct a simple randomized study. 37.5 million (half the funds) could be given to one person, and $107,000 dollars could be given to each of the other 349 submissions. Then we could ask in a decade whether more breakthroughs came from the one team or the other 349 researchers. I hate to bet in cases like this, but if I were a betting man, I would put my money on the 349 researchers. Turning to the actual idea, which is labeled as "one visionary idea." First let me say, finding details about the "one brave idea" is challenging. The AHA seems committed to promoting one brave idea, providing details behind how this funding opportunity was created, but they seem to have much less interest in actually telling us what the one brave idea is exactly. The goal of the project is to see what is the mix of genes and development and environment in early life that lead to coronary artery disease later, and how might this lead to new prevention and new cures. The plan will use "wearables on the wrist" to make measurements, and rely on the "gps on your phone" to measure your movements, and run a number of cell biology studies of these people. Then they will engage patients and families in "holistic ways." "We want to look early because we want to look where no one has looked. Why can't we look for cholesterol under the skin of a 5 year old?" -- is a statement made by the PI. I find it implausible that these measurements will amount to anything in the long run. Many of these wearables have not even shown they can even reliably measure the construct: i.e. do they even measure movement accurately? For 75 million, how big can the sample size be? Can't be that big. I doubt big enough to find a signal in the massive noise. When you start to spend money on testing cholesterol under the skin of 5 year olds -- how much will you have left? Watching the PI discuss this problem is like watching a late night infomercial -- full of rhetoric, empty of usable information/ facts. It is almost as if they just scribbled "scalable/ big data science/ repurpose/ disruptive innovation/ game changer/ holistic/ dogma/ leadership/ focus/ transformative/ silos/ work together/predominant cause of death/ patient engagement/ partnership/ Verily/ AstraZeneca" all over one page and got $75 million in funding. In short, awards like this make the press, but they pollute the public understanding of science, and fail to rigorously test whether the funds could have been spent better, as they lack a control arm. ... and don't get me started about all the funding that the 'team' already receives from traditional sources. Khurram Nasir, MD, of Baptist Health South Florida: While we all cherish the announcement of this exciting project, and though full details are not revealed, limited insights suggest we are chasing the same wine in a different bottle. In essence, the idea (looking for more risk factors and biomarkers) appears to involve recruiting a significant number of young individuals, aggregating a wide range of data from wearables, psychosocial/economic data, biomarkers and genetics, and ultimately using exceptional computational capacity to identify similar looking clusters. This seems novel at first look but for a number of reasons I am skeptical that this project will provide any meaningful information above and beyond existing cohorts such as Framingham Heart Study or MESA. First, the basic premise of the proposal that "half of patients with coronary heart disease have no known risk factor, such as high cholesterol" is clearly a myth, as it is well known that a majority (77-100%) of those presenting with CHD have established risk factors. Second, we are increasingly growing to realize that at least one-third of those with extensive risk factors don't develop atherosclerotic plaques. So the quest for new markers to expand the scope of those at risk is baffling. Third, its is very unlikely that in the 5-year period there will be enough concrete endpoints to pinpoint the combined impact of the findings; that would require a very large sample size. I would prefer we encourage more thoughtful ways to promote ideal cardiovascular health at an early age using well established methods to minimize disease burden and associated costs. For instance, a more pragmatic approach would be to pick out disparate risk groups such as those with low or risk factors and high actual disease burden (atherosclerotic plaque as with simple CAC testing) versus those with multiple risk factors and no disease and use all the proposed information in the right settings. In my my humble view, this study design would eventually shed more light on the underlying clusters of environmental/genetic/lifestyle factors forecasting those at actual risk of disease. Even more importantly, it would help us understand why those with traditionally high risk combinations (including family history) do not eventually develop disease. 2016-10-10T06:00:00-0400 3 comments Next More in Cardiology Angiomax Edges Heparin on Real-World Bleeding Complications Cath Lab Recap: Extra-Strong ICD Shocks; EMS Crew Training Speeds Thrombolysis Statin Intensity and Mortality; ECG for MD; Smokers' AAA Risk Can TAVR Cost Be Justified in Mid-Risk Patients?

Chrome 55, scheduled to arrive in December, will have an upgraded V8 JavaScript engine that will reduce RAM requirements by as much as 50 percent over the current version of the browser. However, the decrease in RAM consumption won't be across the board, as the chart below from the V8 JavaScript Engine blog shows. For example, The New York Times website showed a significant drop in memory use, while the same was rather low for Twitter and The Washington Post. The changes will be seen on the desktop as well as mobile versions of Google Chrome, but will be more apparent on devices with low RAM (say, less than 4GB).Though Google has said that it will release the Chrome 55 update on December 6, users can sign up for the beta version of the browser to test if the RAM consumption actually goes down. The Internet search giant has also said that "over the next months" it will work on improving Chrome's performance on devices with 512MB-1GB of RAM. Chrome 53 came with Material Design enhancements and started blocking Adobe Flash in favour of HTML5. Last month, Google also said that the browser has seen double-digit growth in speed as well as battery efficiency over the past year. The version of Chrome scheduled to release in January will start labelling HTTP pages as 'non-secure' in an effort to transition completely to the secure HTTPS standard.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Don’t buy a Galaxy Note 7—and return yours if you already have With production and sales of the Note 7 paused, we've got some alternate picks. by Andrew Cunningham - Oct 10, 2016 2:40 pm UTC Login to bookmark 137 Enlarge Ron Amadeo Update: There are no "safe" Galaxy Note 7s. Samsung originally had a replacement plan, but it was later discovered that replacement units were also defective and dangerous. The entire Note 7 line has been canceled and all Note 7 units have been deemed unsafe. If you are in possession of any version of the Galaxy Note 7, turn it off and return it immediately. When we review phones, we do our best to tell you everything you need to make a smart purchase. We talk about the underlying tech, too, but in the end, people usually read a review because they either want to know which thing to buy or they want to know more about the thing they already intend to buy. Usually, we give you all of that information and make a general recommendation but leave the ultimate purchasing decision up to you. But for Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, we need to go a step further: don’t buy this phone. And if you have bought it, you should return the Galaxy Note 7 immediately and purchase something else. Our recommendation is made purely for safety reasons. All of the original devices shipped with defective batteries that can (and have) spontaneously burst into flames, burning users, damaging property, and putting anyone nearby at risk of smoke inhalation. Despite a highly publicized multi-billion dollar recall, early indications suggest that replacement phones have the same problem. As of this writing, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon have stopped selling the phone, and Samsung has temporarily halted production. That's unprecedented in the modern smartphone era, and it should give you an idea of how real and serious the problem is. We may revisit our recommendation in the future if Samsung can demonstrate that the problem is under control, but at this point, it’s clear that Samsung doesn’t know exactly what the problem is. Even if you’re a die-hard Samsung or Galaxy Note fan, you should hold off on buying or keeping this phone. The Note 7 offers a few perks—a built-in iris scanner, the S Pen, IP68 water resistance—that aren’t commonly available in other high-end Android phones. But if you’re just looking for a solid phone that can get the job done, here are our recommendations for replacement devices in the meantime. Google Our full review of Google's Pixel phones is forthcoming, but it should be a safe bet. Google Our full review of Google's Pixel phones is forthcoming, but it should be a safe bet. Ron Amadeo The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are still pretty new and share many of the Note 7's specs. Ron Amadeo The Galaxy Note 5 is a year old, but it's still got that S Pen goodness if that's the most important feature for you. Ron Amadeo The OnePlus 3 is missing some things, but at half the price, it's a solid contender. Andrew Cunningham The iPhone 6S Plus (second from left) and 7 Plus (second from right) are solid choices if you want to give another ecosystem a try. Google’s Pixel XL: This one comes with an asterisk since it’s not quite out yet and we haven’t fully reviewed it. But HTC’s phones have always been safe, and Google’s Android phones are basically the only ones you can count on if you want prompt version and security updates. Google also promises a solid camera and unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. Be sure to buy the phone directly from Google and not from Verizon, even if you ultimately plan to use it on Verizon—as usual, Big Red is going to keep you from getting timely updates, and it will also pre-install Verizon apps that you may or may not be able to remove. Our full review of both Pixel phones will hit later this month. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge: Smartphone chips aren’t getting faster at the same rate that they used to, but that works to your advantage here. Samsung’s spring flagships use the same Snapdragon 820 chip and 4GB of RAM you’d get in the Note 7, and the larger S7 Edge is actually pretty close to the Note 7 in size. You lose the S Pen, the iris scanner, and USB Type-C, but in most of the important ways, this is still an impressive phone. Samsung isn’t the best at software updates, but it’s fairly good at keeping up with security patches, and you should at least get a Nougat update at some point in the next few months. The Galaxy Note 5: Don’t let that number fool you—this is last year’s Galaxy Note. There was no Galaxy Note 6. This is a step down from the Note 7 and the S7 in a few important ways. It’s not water-resistant, it doesn’t have an SD card slot, and since it’s last year’s phone, it’s going to stop getting updates sooner. But its specs are still solid, you can get it for slightly cheaper than a Note 7, and it has the same 5.7-inch 1440p screen and S-Pen support if the integrated stylus is a big selling point for you. The OnePlus 3: OnePlus’ third crack at a flagship phone definitely isn’t as high-end as the Note series, but a $400 starting price makes it worth a look. It still has a Snapdragon 820 SoC and a 5.5-inch screen at a respectable 1080p resolution. The camera isn’t quite up to Samsung’s standards, but it’s respectable. The “Oxygen OS” flavor of Android doesn’t get updates at Pixel-speed, but it also doesn’t come with a lot of extraneous bloat. For half the price of a Note 7, it’s at least worth a look. The iPhone 6S Plus or 7 Plus: If you’ve already been thinking about jumping the fence, both of Apple’s big phones are solid handsets. You won’t be able to take your Google Play apps with you, but Apple’s app ecosystem is excellent and its phones are fast. You won’t have to worry about updates, either—all iPhones get them at the same time regardless of who you buy from, and phones are typically fully supported for four or five years (as opposed to two or three for Nexuses and Pixel phones). Get the 7 Plus if you want the absolute latest and greatest and care about water resistance, but the 6S Plus is still solid if you want to save a little money and/or keep a standard headphone jack. Expand full story Promoted Comments ArcSyn Smack-Fu Master, in training jump to post Everyone brings up the OnePlus3, which is a nice phone, but it needs at minimum an asterisk that it does not support Verizon's network at all. Considering the size of their network in the USA, I think it's worth at least a mention. I know I had looked into it previously for my next phone but since I'm on Verizon it's not an option. 11 posts | registered 3/9/2016 Reader comments 137 You must login or create an account to comment.

She told CNBC: "I said to the recruiter, 'I definitely love Google, but at the end of the day, I can safely say that Google is a place I want to be for the next two years. After that, I'll probably leave and start a company of my own.'" Wessel kept her word. Just over two years after starting at Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters in July 2012, Wessel turned down an offer and left the company. That same night, July 11, 2014, she and JJ Fliegelman launched WayUp, a site that connects students and recent grads with jobs at places like Uber, Goldman Sachs and her previous employer, Google. Within two weeks, Wessel and Fliegelman had raised $1 million in venture funding. Source: WayUp WayUp co-founders Liz Wessel and JJ Fliegelman Wessel always knew she wanted to start a company. "It was not really a question," she said. "But a lot of people advised me to first work for someone else for a couple of years and really learn from them so that I could set myself up for success." She was completely transparent with Google's hiring team. After stating her intention to leave after two years, she asked the recruiter two questions: "Number one, am I going to burn any bridges by doing this? And number two, if not, do you have any examples of people who have done this program before and successfully left?" The recruiter assured Wessel she wouldn't be burning any bridges and listed a handful of successful entrepreneurs who had left the program to build companies. One such individual was Kevin Systrom, who went on to found Instagram, which was bought by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012. Liz Wessel Liz Wessel While Google was completely supportive of Wessel's career path, it may not be the smartest move at every company. "I don't think you can give your two years notice to just anyone," Wessel said. "Pick and choose who you do that with." It's also role dependent, she said. "There are some positions where you can't do that. I'm not going to hire a VP who wants to leave in two years, for example, because that just feels really short." As for turning down an offer from Google, ranked by Fortune as the best company to work for in 2016, "it was tough," the WayUp CEO said. "But I always tell people, you know it's time to quit your job when you can't stop thinking about what you want to do next." "I kept thinking in the back of my mind," she continued, "there's this problem of college students not being able to get jobs easily, and I know exactly how to solve it — but I can't do that while still at Google."

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 14, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Google’s biggest ever product announcement: what are the implications for search? Industry More News 10 Oct 16 | Tom Murphy Facebook0 Linkedin242 Google+18 Twitter 260 Google has been prepping a slew of new products for the limelight and after slowly and (probably) intentionally leaking those over time, it made the official announcement on October 4th. New products include a pair of Pixel smartphones, Google Home smart speaker, Daydream VR set, Google Wi-Fi router, and a higher-definition Chromecast streaming dongle. Something to note right off the bat is that the products themselves don’t offer new functionality for the consumer. In fact, they overtly mirror the utility offered by comparable products in the market, most notably Apple’s gold standard iPhone and Amazon’s wildly popular Echo platform. So what’s the motivation? Extend the search experience to new channels Google’s first (literally) cardboard VR experience was available for just $15. Now Google is upping the ante with a still very affordable $79 Daydream View headset custom tailored to Pixel devices. Turnkey advertising solutions won’t exist here out of the gate, so brand opportunities will revolve around content. Imagine a relatively seamless transition from a Google search for say, “St. Regis Princeville,” to a branded 360-degree VR experience on YouTube. It is exciting to dream up what the consideration phase will look like in another five years as brands begin to sponsor content creation in new, widely adopted formats. Voice search is becoming less of a fad and more of a simple reality. 20% of searches are already driven by voice commands. Google has already begun developing AdWords reporting to share voice search performance data with advertisers. However, Google Home isn’t only about monetizing more search queries, but building new pathways to capture search intent. Google Home will answer basic questions about the weather, the presidential debate schedule, or the number of quarts in a gallon, but we should consider more unique extensions – such as integrations with Google Express, Google Maps, or Uber to reduce friction on local purchase intent. Diversification away from search ads We are nowhere near peak-Google. CPCs are remarkably flat while ad inventory continues to increase. Google can still offer advertisers more paid clicks for low or no marginal cost, but continues to grow its own revenue aggressively. Everyone is still invited to the paid search party; more paid clicks are coming from new ad formats and more ad slots across Google properties. That said, opportunities to drive new search ad revenue are not infinite. It is undeniable that Google is trying hard to find a niche outside of search. Right now, none of its ‘other bets’ can rival its ad sales. In fact, they are really good at bleeding money and creating shareholder anxiety. Google will always have a strong ad sales organization, but long term growth depends on non-advertising revenue streams. Smart devices powering smarter homes isn’t a moonshot like self-driving cars, but it’s far more aligned to Google’s core value proposition of offering solutions to consumers’ rapidly evolving needs. Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin242 Google+18 Twitter 260 Related articles Five most important search marketing news stories of the week ​How young marketers can impact digital strategies Insurers starting to get to grips with online conversion and complex forms How Google Symptom Search will affect the healthcare industry Bridging mobile search to consumer electronics Everyone knows that Google wants to win at mobile. Mobile search accounts for a strong majority of Google search traffic and Google’s own AdWords platform was an early adopter of a mobile-first mentality. Google must be looking over its shoulder at Facebook’s astonishing 84% mobile share of ad revenue and wondering how to become a larger piece of the user’s mindshare. Google’s suite of free apps and services like Gmail, Google Drive, Chrome, Docs, and YouTube has long been subsidized by advertising revenue and made available to consumers in a device-agnostic way. Google’s Nexus line was moderately priced to increase accessibility. The question is: Can moving away from Nexus to offer a premium device with competitive tech specs make a compelling enough case for consumers to buy Pixels? Based on what we know now, the Google brand itself is the mechanism being asked to mobilize an audience large enough to carry a new standalone consumer electronics offering to heights it hasn’t been able to achieve with Nexus. Takeaways As marketers, it’s our job to understand macro trends and potential impact on advertising channels that may represent opportunities for our clients. After reflecting on Google’s largest product announcement ever, it is clear that Google is going all-in on the smart home. Consumers are more likely than ever to start the purchase journey on Amazon versus a search engine. Both Apple and Amazon are using Bing search results for voice searches coming through their devices. Google Home is a strong signal that Google doesn’t think it can win in voice search with Android powered devices alone. Amidst significant challenges from competitors, Google’s success in the smart home will depend on its ability to build new and innovative connections for the consumer. The quality of these executions have the potential to differentiate Google Home from other smart speakers in a material way. Tom Murphy is Associate Director of Performance Media at DigitasLBi.

Google announced one of the biggest typography projects, Noto, on Thursday. The font family covers more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff October 8, 2016 Save for later Saved About video ads Google launches Noto, a family of fonts that covers over 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. View Caption About video ads View Caption of When your computer doesn’t recognize a language, a blank box is displayed on the screen – commonly known as a tofu. Seeing a tofu constantly is frustrating for those who find that they cannot share texts in their original scripts. Ali Eteraz, a Pakistani-American writer, wrote in a Medium post in 2013 about how nastaliq, a script from Urdu, which is a language spoken in Pakistan and India, is not supported in digital devices, so Urdu speakers must resort to pasting images of words to share texts, using other scripts, or simply writing with Western letters. “Constantly uploading image files to communicate maybe romantic (or it can make you feel like a second class digital citizen), but it is not practical,” he wrote. Recommended: Five times Internet activism made a difference On Thursday, Google announced their solution for the problem: Noto, named literally for “no more tofu,” a font family that covers more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. The project, five years in the making, is one of the biggest typography projects in recent times. It will be open source and free for download. Five times Internet activism made a difference Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend “Our goal for Noto has been to create fonts for our devices, but we’re also very interested in keeping information alive,” Bob Jung, director of internationalization for Google said in a press release. “When it comes to some of these lesser used languages, or even the purely academic or dead languages, we think it’s really important to preserve them. Without the digital capability of Noto, it’s much more difficult to preserve that cultural resource.” Noto, a product of collaboration between Google and font company Monotype, aims to “enable global communications across borders, languages, cultures and time periods,” as stated in the press release. While some may be wary of Google’s motives – the project arguably plays right into the giant company’s ambitions for global expansion – the goal is fitting to a time when more people than ever are using the Internet. For global minorities to be welcomed to the Internet with a familiar language can be vital in encouraging accessibility. “I’m hugely excited about this because Noto is massive and it’s really an amazing public service,” Finn Bunton, assistant professor at New York University, tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview. “Companies have incentives for doing this, but this is a pretty amazing thing to be done by Google.” Professor Bunton says Noto is monumental because until now, text has been transmitted and displayed in screens only through limited codes, which means some fonts don't even offer accented characters. Since the 1990s, the Unicode Consortium, a nonprofit that sets standard code points for symbols, characters, and even emojis on the Internet, has worked to create unique identifiers for every glyph in written languages. “But that didn’t mean you would be able to translate that into something that you could rely on to look good, be readable and work appropriately across a huge variety of platforms,” Bunton explains. “This is what Noto has done which is so amazing.… They’ve made a consistent library where all the pieces are going to be visually harmonious and easy to read.” Figuring out the unique codes for different languages can be tough. As reported by NPR in 2014, Unicode ran into trouble when they  clumped Chinese, Japanese and Korean into one character set. “You’d get this mishmash of fonts,” Jung told WIRED in an interview. “That was always the complaint we got – fonts just don’t look good when you mix languages.” Monotype and Google worked with reviewers who are native readers of the language or experts in typography to refine the product, including a Buddhist monastery who critiqued the font and made adjustments for the Tibetan script. For some languages, this may be the first time the script has a digital presence, let alone a dedicated display font. "That in particular is something that many different language communities could not afford to do on their own,” Monotype linguistic typographer Kamal Mansour said in the press release. “Google has been the benefactor in funding this work, and in many cases, we’ve produced the first font ever to serve a particular language community. So to me, the aim is to serve that human community that would otherwise be deprived of the ability to have a digital heritage.” Next up Five times Internet activism made a difference How Saul Bass changed design Verbal energy: Going geeky over type fonts Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads Monitor's Best: Top 5 How Americans are handling post-election hate GOP-controlled Congress will still need Democrats Cover Story Why climate change divides us Minority women make big strides on Election Day The president is commander in chief?

REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) shares slumped more than 13 percent in early trading on Monday after a weekend Bloomberg report that top potential bidders, including Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N), had lost interest in making a bid for the company. Salesforce, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which had worked with banks on a potential acquisition, are unlikely to proceed, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. Twitter had planned to hold a board meeting with outside advisers on Friday to discuss a sale but canceled, Bloomberg reported, citing one person familiar with the matter. (bloom.bg/2dAlT7J) Twitter's shares plunged about 20 percent over the final two days of last week after technology website Recode reported that Google, Disney and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) were not interested in the company, which put itself up for potential sale last month. Twitter's stock fell to $17.21 on Monday, the lowest in more than two months. At that price, the company has a market value of $12.18 billion, compared with almost $53 billion at its peak in December 2013. Salesforce shares rose 5.3 percent to $74.65. Analysts and investors had raised concerns that a takeover of Twitter could severely hit the cloud software maker's market value. Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff had publicly expressed his interest in Twitter, but stopped short of saying the company would make a bid. Twitter, struggling with stagnant user growth and continuing losses, had told potential acquirers it wanted any deliberations on a sale to conclude by the time it reported third-quarter results on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Many investors and analysts believe that Twitter, co-founded and run by Jack Dorsey, does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as interim CEO in July 2015 and became permanent chief executive last October, has made a big push into live video, signing deals with a number of media companies and sports organizations to stream major events such as the presidential debates and Thursday Night NFL games. Up to Friday's close, the stock had lost nearly a quarter of its value since Dorsey took over as permanent CEO.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google makes Hangouts “optional” in Gapps package for OEMs By Ida Torres - October 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter While they are not technically killing it, it seems like Google is demoting its Hangouts app into something that is optional for OEMs in the core Google Mobile Services package or “gapps” that the tech giant requires for Android devices. Previously it was part of what’s required, along with Google Search, Gmail, Calendar, etc. But the latest email to their GMS partners says that they will no longer be required to include Hangouts here and so phones that will be released by 2017 will no longer have the messaging/calling app pre-installed. Surprisingly, what Google chose to replace it with as a “required” app is Duo, the stand-alone video calling service they introduced a few months ago and not Allo, the messaging app that they’re positioning as a competitor to Viber, iMessage, Messenger, etc. This is probably because Google believes that video calling is a pretty important core OS feature, especially since not all messaging apps and carriers actually have this capability available for their users. But still, it is strange that Allo was also not included as a mandatory app. It probably needs even more push as the competition in the messaging app market is pretty tough. There are a lot of more popular apps out there and more and more of them are introducing new features every few days or so. And since Allo is still a relatively new player in the market, Google probably needs to make it even more appealing to users who are used to Telegram, LINE, WhatsApp, etc. If you still prefer Hangouts though, you will still be able to download the app to your smartphone of course. And it’s already not a guarantee that OEMs will stop including it, as it is only a suggestion from Google anyway.

The firm has reportedly bolstered its fleet of autonomous vehicles with a number of new Chrysler Pacifica minivans. Forming part of Google’s partnership with Italian-controlled car maker Fiat Chrysler, two of the vehicles have already been fitted with sensors, ready for the road. Scroll down for video  Google's latest additions to its fleet of driverless vehicles could spell trouble for delivery drivers and tradesmen. A number of Chrysler Pacifica minivans have been seen at a car park in Mountain View, fitted with sensors, ready for the road GOOGLE'S MINIVAN PLANS Six Chrysler Pacifica minivans have been spotted at a Google car park in Mountain View, California. Two of the white vehicles have reportedly been fitted with updated sensors, ready for road tests. The addition of the minivans marks another step in Google’s ambitions for automation and a 'commercialisation friendly' vehicle. According to Electrek, six of the minivans were spotted in a car park in Mountain View, the Californian home of the firm. The arrival of the Chryslers mark another step in Google’s ambitions for automation, with its current fleet of self-driving vehicles limited to bubble car design as well as Lexus SUVs. Electrek reports that the roof-mounted sensors added to the new white vehicles are much smaller than existing sensor arrays. Pictures emerged showing Google has fitted sensors to two of the minivans, making them more ‘commercialisation friendly’ compared to the prototypes, making them more attractive to delivery firms and others and potentially threatening jobs.

Google's current fleet of vehicles with its current fleet of self-driving vehicles is limited to its bubble car design as well as Lexus SUVs (pictured) Fiat Chrysler and Google first announced the partnership in May this year, planning to add 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans which would more than double the size of Google's fleet of self-driving vehicles. As part of the agreement, Chrysler engineers will work with Google to install sensors and software so the vans can drive themselves. The added vehicles are needed as Google expands real-world testing, which has racked up two million miles on public roads. Google says it will own the gas-electric hybrid vans, and it's not currently licensing autonomous car technology to Fiat Chrysler or anyone else. Both companies are free to work with others.

By Jason Murdock October 10, 2016 14:51 BST Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses members of parliament from his ruling AK Party (AKP) during a meeting at the Turkish parliament in Ankara on June 11, 2013ADEM ALTAN/AFP/Getty Images In an attempt to curb the spread of leaked emails from a high-ranking government official, the Turkish government reportedly blocked access to a slew of well-known technology and cloud services in the country, including Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive. According to Turkey Blocks, a web monitoring organisation that reported the outages, the nationwide censorship attempt was launched on 8 October. It followed the release of 17GB-worth of leaked emails allegedly from Berat Albayrak, minister of energy and natural resources who is also the son-in-law of Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Upon analysis, the monitoring group found that both Google Drive and Dropbox services were issuing SSL errors. This, it said in a blog post, indicated the traffic was being intercepted at a national or internet service provider (ISP) level. Additionally, the impacted services included popular developer platform GitHub. Impacted ISPs reportedly included TTNet, UyduNet and Turkcell, although foreign visitors in Turkey would still be able to access the cloud platforms as "their data is tunnelled to the country of origin." In its latest Twitter update, Turkey Blocks said that access to Google Drive has since been restored due to the fact it complied with the takedown demands of the government. Some users in the region have indicated that Dropbox has been restored. A spokesperson confirmed to IBTimes UK that its cloud service appears to be back online, saying: "We are pleased to confirm that Dropbox is now available to our users in Turkey again." The leaked data in question is a massive trove of 57,623 emails from the Turkish government dating as far back as 2000, according to The Daily Dot, who obtained a full copy of the stolen messages. The emails exposed how pro-establishment social media trolls were silencing criticism and targeting any opposition to the government. The hackers were threatening to leak the stolen data if the Turkish government failed to set free a number of leftist dissidents. Far from complying with these demands, the government instead chose to ban a slew of news outlets and forced Twitter to suspend accounts circulating the leak, the Daily Dot said at the time. A court in Ankara confirmed the legitimacy of the email leak in a legal order that discussed the investigation of suspected RedHack members. IBTimes UK contacted Microsoft and Google for additional comment however had received no response at the time of publication. Previously, the Turkish government banned whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks after it published over 300,000 emails purportedly hacked from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party AKP. As reported, the Julian Assange-led operation claimed it came under "sustained attack" after announcing plans to release the data into the public domain. The censoring of technology and social platforms has long been used by Turkey to curb dissent. Even before the massive coup attempt in the country earlier this year, Turkish courts have been known to issue nationwide blocks to websites. In 2014, Tayyip Erdogan vowed to "wipe out" Twitter. During the bloody 2016 coup attempt, which claimed the lives of almost 300 people, Turkey Blocks claimed that Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were blocked in the country. Yet in an ironic move, the Turkish president himself was forced to rely on FaceTime streaming to address the nation during his time of crisis.

Spy photos capture Google's self-driving Chrysler minivans Engadget 10/10/2016 Steve Dent © Provided by Engadget Google will soon have self-driving minivans on the roads, judging by spy shots leaked by Electrek. The photos, taken from a Google facility in Mountain View, show a half-dozen Chrysler Pacifica vans being set up with Google's latest self-driving sensors. In total, it will equip 100 such vehicles with the tech, thanks to a deal with Fiat Chrysler. While a minivan may not be the self-driving vehicle of your dreams, Google said in May that it "gives us an opportunity to test a larger vehicle that could be easier for passengers to enter and exit, particularly with features like hands-free sliding doors." Judging by the photos, it has also developed a roof-mounted sensor pack, including radar, lidar and cameras that protrudes less, and some kind of bumper-mounted device. While a minivan may not be the self-driving vehicle of your dreams, Google said in May that it "gives us an opportunity to test a larger vehicle that could be easier for passengers to enter and exit, particularly with features like hands-free sliding doors." Google also said that the Pacifica design makes it "easy for us to install our self-driving systems, including the computers that hold our self-driving software, and the sensors that enable our software to see what's on the road around the vehicle." The model they chose is also a rechargeable hybrid minivan with a 16 kWh battery and 30 miles of range, providing the "robust" electrical system Google needs for its tech. Mountain View kicked off the self-driving vehicle craze after it developed some of the first models after recruiting researchers that won a DARPA challenge in 2010. However, despite recently hitting the two million milestone, it's lagging considerably behind Tesla, which has logged over 200 million "autopilot" miles. 100 new vehicles means it has tripled its fleet size, so it's now aiming to "make transportation more accessible for millions of people" with its autonomous technology, it said.

Home News Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones Stunning video shows capabilities of the Pixel XL camera An amazing 4K video which shows the possibilities of Google's new phone, Pixel XL By: Lana Jelic | Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones News | Posted: Oct 10, 2016 1:31 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Google spent a lot of time talking about the amazing camera on their new Pixel phone, calling it the "best smartphone camera ever made."     The camera of the Pixel and Pixel XL features a 12.3MP sensor with f/2.0, and during the presentation, they showed some amazing photos and videos adding that the speed of the camera and incredible video stabilization technology are very important.   One lucky user supposedly got to test the Pixel XL camera, and he posted an amazing 4K video which shows the possibilities of Google's new phone. He shot the video in two days and according to him, "Pixel XL blows the door of the iPhone 7 Plus when it comes to 4K video", which is quite an accomplishment. He added that the image stabilization needs some work, but overall, the result is amazing, which you can check out in the video below.     If you want to compare the Pixel XL camera, he also made a 4K video using an iPhone 7 Plus.   Update: There are some rumors that the video might be fake, pointed out by some Reddit users, and we will inform you when Google confirms or denies the video.

So much news goes on that it’s almost impossible for mere mortals with real lives to keep track of everything. That’s why we’ve compiled a quick and dirty list of the top 10 tech stories from this week. Everything from how a new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 forced a flight to evacuate to everything we know about “Blade Runner 2049”, it’s all here. Smoking replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 forces evacuation of flight The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 situation is getting more and more serious. Between children getting burned and fires getting started, Samsung has caused some serious havoc. The latest chapter in the saga? A smoking Galaxy Note 7 forced a Southwest flight to evacuate. The real kicker to this story is that the Galaxy Note 7 in question wasn’t an old model — it was one of the replacement models. What that means is that even replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones could be at risk of exploding. Obviously, that’s not good for Samsung. Read the full story here. Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — Oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event Google announced a bunch of new hardware at its October 4 event, including two Pixel phones, a Daydream View VR headset, Google Home, Chromecast Ultra, Google Wifi and more. We gathered all the product news into one handy article. Here’s everything you need to know about the new products and when you can get them. Read the full story here. Everything we know so far about ‘Blade Runner 2049’ In an era where studios relentlessly plunder the tombs of movies past, looking for the next successful remake or reboot, few revivals have caused as much trepidation and/or excitement as the upcoming Blade Runner sequel. Though some might consider it sacrilege to make a sequel to such a singular film, some big names behind the project — including Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott himself as producer and story developer — have made this one of the most anticipated sequels in the genre. Read the full story here. Jeep wants the Grand Wagoneer to be America’s Range Rover Jeep is moving forward with the development of a luxurious, range-topping SUV aimed squarely at Land Rover’s Range Rover. Recently approved for production, the long-rumored model will revive the storied Grand Wagoneer nameplate that has laid dormant for a quarter of a century. Some sources believe the Grand Wagoneer will share its basic platform and many mechanical components with the new Maserati Levante.

The promise of a premium-feeling Android phone, with a new virtual assistant and access to the latest Android software, is tantalizing enough to make even the most content iPhone users consider a switch at upgrade time. As someone who vacillates between iOS and Android fairly often, but who considers a lightly cracked iPhone 6S her daily driver, I’m also considering whether the Pixel phone is the next phone to buy. All of the software I use now is available on Android: all of my top email, calendar, music, fitness, photography, task-based, work collaboration, and social networking apps are there. But one app is not, and that’s iMessage. Every time someone has asked me if they should switch, I ask them one question: do you use iMessage? If the answer is "Yes," the Pixel decision becomes that much more difficult. Every app I use is on Android, except for iMessage Over time, iMessage has become indispensable in my everyday life. If the gadgets I have to carry with me on a daily basis are the bones of my tech existence, iMessage is the connective tissue. It’s quick work chats; it’s sharing location on the way to a meeting or dinner; it’s sending a GIF of a hug to a friend who is having a bad day; it’s keeping in touch with mom; it’s getting a series of poop emojis from my niece on her iPod Touch. Many of these functions are just what messaging is, and can be done on other apps, too; I also use Messenger and Snapchat. Google has just rebooted its entire messaging strategy, launching both Allo (an intelligent text messaging app) and Duo (the video messaging app below), which will supplant Hangouts as the default video app on Android phones. But other messaging apps feel like disparate, fragmented experiences, whereas iMessage has collated most people I communicate with into one place. iMessage, of course, isn’t the only incentive for established iPhone users to stick with Apple. Apple’s ongoing emphasis on privacy and security helps make the case, especially when it comes to authentication and payments. Another possible incentive is early access to apps. A lot of software developers I talk to still build for iOS first, despite the fact that the Google Play Store sees many more downloads. This is partially because it’s easier to develop for iOS — there are only so many devices to optimize for, compared with the Android hardware ecosystem — but also due to the amount of money people spend in Apple’s App Store compared with Google’s. But the main draw of iOS is really interoperability between iPhone and other Apple products, and nothing is stickier in that regard than iMessage (for better or worse). Is "continuity" a good feature? Sure, the Mail app pops up in the dock on my laptop when I’m composing an email on the iPhone, but I rarely take advantage of that. Is accepting a phone call over Wi-Fi on the laptop convenient? Yeah, but the call quality isn’t very good and it’s a last-resort option for me. iMessage is the core app I use most between the Apple devices I own or try out. For a company that has failed at social networks, Apple has inadvertently built one with iMessage's blue bubbles Back in June, when Apple showed off a bunch of new iMessage features and said it would be opening up iMessage to third-party app developers, some people wondered whether the company would go even a step further and bring iMessage to Android phones. It was a valid question in the "who-really-knows-what-Apple-will-do" sense, but still, the idea made little sense to me. Of course Apple wasn’t going to allow iMessage to function on Android: iMessage is the glue that keeps people stuck to their iPhones and Macs. That’s not to say iMessage is perfect; it’s not. There are times when that interoperability between desktop and phone just doesn’t work like it’s supposed to, like when group threads get chopped up into separate, unwieldy threads. And let’s not forget that Apple rolled out features like GIFs and sticker packs long after other popular messaging apps did. And if you have made the jump from iOS to Android, you know just how ridiculously frustrating it is to have your text messages lost into the ether, due to the screwy way the data-to-SMS transition is handled. But for a company that has failed at most attempts to create social networks, Apple has inadvertently built one with all of those little blue bubbles. Google’s new Pixel might very well be the high-end Android phone we’ve all be waiting for. Its virtual assistant may be smarter, and Google certainly has Apple beat in terms of volume of messaging apps. But for addicted iMessage users, it might feel impossible to quit. Poll Would you switch from iPhone to Pixel phone?

Machine Learning and the Simplicity of the World   October 10, 2016 at 8:00 am   Bill Gardner There are many potential medical applications of machine learning, such as reading radiological images. But despite decades of effort, machine learning has found fewer applications in medicine than in many other fields. Is this about to change? Machine learning is transforming many technology applications and attracting large investments from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. So I’ve been trying to figure out what machine learning is and how it works. That led me to a remarkable paper. The deep learning algorithm is a machine learning technology that enables computers to classify images by learning from example data. The key idea is that input data (e.g., the matrix of pixels that comprise the photo of the Audi on the left) are processed through a hierarchical chain of linear and non-linear transformations. Each transformation (or layer) is implemented as a neural network. Each layer takes the output of the previous layer as input, finds structure in it, and passes the results as output to the next layer. The final output is a classification of the original image (“Audi A7”). The Google Tensor Flow project documents the impressive recent progress in deep learning: error rates on a benchmark task have fallen by a factor of five in the last four years. The Deep Learning algorithm. The paper in question is about why deep learning works. Henry Lin, who seems to be an undergraduate prodigy, and Max Tegmark, a well-known theoretical physicist (hereafter, L & T), argue that deep learning works not only because it is a powerful algorithm, but also because the world, seen at a high level of abstraction, is simple, and hence learnable. We show how the success of deep learning depends not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can be approximated through “cheap learning” with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones, because they have simplifying properties tracing back to the laws of physics. The exceptional simplicity of physics-based functions hinges on properties such as symmetry, locality, compositionality and polynomial log-probability, and we explore how these properties translate into exceptionally simple neural networks… Why is it surprising that deep learning works? An image classification application is a function that maps complex data (e.g., a dense grid of pixels) to a category (a particular brand of car). Constructing such a function (“training” the machine learner) is essentially a curve fitting exercise. In math, how to fit a curve to a highly complex functions is a solved problem. But what the math shows is that you can approximate a complex function as accurately as you like, given indefinitely large amounts of data and unlimited time. But an algorithm that doesn’t converge to a solution before the Sun explodes won’t replace a radiologist. The computer science problem, therefore, is to find a computationally feasible technology. Deep learning models are simple enough that you can train them in a reasonable amount of time, and yet they solve challenging image classification problems. So, how do they do that? L & T say that deep learning works not just because the algorithm is built on clever, powerful math, but also because the physical structure of the world is simple. Moreover, the world is simple in a way that is mirrored by the structure of the algorithm. To me, the claim that ‘the world is simple’ is what stand-up humour must be like on the planet Vulcan. L & T remark that For reasons that are still not fully understood, our universe can be accurately described by polynomial Hamiltonians of low order d. That line just kills, no? The claim seems absurd: if you’ve studied molecular biology, you weren’t staggered by the simplicity of the world. But L & T’s point is that if you look up the famous eponymous equations (Maxwell’s, etc.), the ones that drive the world, they are often strikingly simple. This may not be an accident. Maxwell’s equations in differential equation form. As a commenter on the L & T paper noted, These properties of the… Hamiltonian[s] appear necessary in order for the world to “work”: to be described by equations of motion or, equivalently, field equations that have mathematically stable, robust solutions. In other words, if these fundamental laws were more complicated, the transitions of the world from one state to the next would be chaotic. Stuff would blow up. L & T also identify several other physical features of the world that make things simple. For each such feature, they argue that it is mirrored by a feature of the mathematics of deep learning. The most important of these features is the hierarchical structure of compositionally, which is mirrored by the layers of deep learning. One of the most striking features of the physical world is its hierarchical structure. Spatially, it is an object hierarchy: elementary particles form atoms which in turn form molecules, cells, organisms, planets, solar systems, galaxies, etc. Causally, complex structures are frequently created through a distinct sequence of simpler steps. The cool thing about this hierarchy — that big things are composed of little things that are composed of yet littler things — is that it makes human learning a lot easier. To understand what happens at one scale, you need to know about the littler stuff one level down that your objects are composed of.  To understand cell biology, you need to know some biochemistry. But you don’t have to master the entire stack: quantum mechanics not required. L & T argue that the compositional hierarchy simplifies learning for machines too.* That is, deep learning works because the layers of networks mirror the compositional hierarchy in that each successive layer condenses the information that was output from the previous layer.** The deep learning algorithm can concentrate its effort on one part of the problem at a time, rather than thinking about everything at once. So L & T’s argument is that: (1) The world has a physical architecture that is isomorphic to the mathematical architecture of deep learning. (2) Deep learning works when (and because) it finds this hierarchy and exploits the underlying simplicity to reduce the burden of computation. This suggests that deep learning represents a breakthrough in our ability to make machines that can perceive what we perceive. Even if that’s true, that doesn’t mean that deep learning can endow machines with human intelligence. We can do a lot more than process light on our retinas into percepts like “Audi 7”. We can also prove theorems. But it’s not obvious to me how a deep learner could carry out a logical deduction; and that’s just one example of what we can do. But who cares? If deep learning represents a tipping point in progress toward mechanized perception, it will lead to significant advances in many areas of medicine. I’m also struck that L & T may have uncovered something about why we are so at home in the world. By “at home”, I mean that we have minds that seemingly effortlessly project a world of objects that are “at hand” for our understanding and use. Our brains are much more complex than the deep learning algorithm, but they too can be described as layers of neural networks. If so, perhaps we are at home in the world because we too mirror the world’s physical architecture. *L & T are not saying that deep learning identifies an Audi by first recognizing molecules of steel and glass and then moving up. It’s just an analogy. As the figure at the top suggests, the algorithm decomposes images into features, but aren’t the same hierarchy of features as the canonical physical hierarchy that L & T reference. It’s not clear to me whether this is a significant weakness in their argument. ** That is, each layer calculates and outputs sufficient statistics that summarize the essential features of the inputs to the layer, with minimal loss of useful information. @Bill_Gardner Tweetable Comments closed     Explaining Research, Life, Medicine   artificial intelligence, machine learning Loading Follow the blog Why all these options?

While companies like Google are confidently pronouncing that we live in an "AI-first age," with machine learning breaking new ground in areas like speech and image recognition, those at the front lines of AI research are keen to point out that there’s still a lot of work to be done. Just because we have digital assistants that sound like the talking computers in movies doesn’t mean we’re much closer to creating true artificial intelligence. Problems include the need for vast amounts of data to power deep learning systems; our inability to create AI that is good at more than one task; and the lack of insight we have into how these systems work in the first place. Machine learning in 2016 is creating brilliant tools, but they can be hard to explain, costly to train, and often mysterious even to their creators. Let’s take a look at these challenges in more detail: First you get the data, then you get the AI We all know that artificial intelligence needs data to learn about the world, but we often overlook how much data is involved. These systems don’t just require more information than humans to understand concepts or recognize features, they require hundreds of thousands times more, says Neil Lawrence, a professor of machine learning at the University of Sheffield and part of Amazon’s AI team. "And if you look at all the applications domains were deep learning is successful you’ll see they’re domains where we can acquire a lot of data," says Lawrence, giving the example of speech and image recognition. Here, big tech firms like Google and Facebook have access to mountains of data (for example, your voice searches on Android), making it much easier to create useful tools. Right now, says Lawrence, data is like coal was in the early years of the Industrial Revolution. He gives the example of Thomas Newcomen — an Englishman who, in 1712, invented a primitive version of the steam engine that ran on coal, about 60 years before James Watt did. Newcomen’s invention wasn’t very good: compared to Watt’s machine, it was inefficient and costly to run. That meant it was put to work only in coalfields — where the fuel was plentiful enough to overcome the machine’s handicaps. A screenshot from Facebook's open-source image recognition tools. Lawrence suggests that all around the world there are hundreds of Newcomens working on their own machine learning models. They might be revolutionary, but without the data to make them work, we’ll never know. Big tech firms like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are today’s coal mines. They have abundant data and so can afford to run inefficient machine learning systems, and improve them. Smaller startups might have good ideas, but they won’t be able to follow through without data. "it's considered unethical to force people to become sick to acquire data." The problem is even bigger when you look at areas where data is difficult to get your hands on. Take health care, for example, where AI is being used for machine vision tasks like recognizing tumors in X-ray scans, but where digitized data can be sparse. As Lawrence points out, the tricky bit here is that it’s "generally considered unethical to force people to become sick to acquire data." (That’s what makes deals like that struck between Google and the National Health Service in the UK so significant.) The problem, says Lawrence, is not really about finding ways to distribute data, but about making our deep learning systems more efficient and able to work with less data. And just like Watt’s improvements, that might take another 60 years. Specialization is for insects — AI needs to be able to multitask There’s another key problem with deep learning: the fact that all our current systems are, essentially, idiot savants. Once they’ve been trained, they can be incredibly efficient at tasks like recognizing cats or playing Atari games, says Google DeepMind research scientist Raia Hadsell. But "there is no neural network in the world, and no method right now that can be trained to identify objects and images, play Space Invaders, and listen to music." (Neural networks are the building blocks of deep learning systems.) "we can’t even learn multiple games." The problem is even worse than that, though. When Google’s DeepMind announced in February last year that it’d built a system that could beat 49 Atari games, it was certainly a massive achievement, but each time it beat a game the system needed to be retrained to beat the next one. As Hadsell points out, you can’t try to learn all the different games at once, as the rules end up interfering with one another. You can learn them one at a time — but you end up forgetting whatever you knew about previous games. "To get to artificial general intelligence we need something that can learn multiple tasks," says Hadsell. "But we can’t even learn multiple games." A solution to this might be something called progressive neural networks — this means connecting separate deep learning systems together so that they can pass on certain bits of information. In a paper published on this topic in June, Hadsell and her team showed how their progressive neural nets were able to adapt to games of Pong that varied in small ways (in one version the colors were inverted; in another the controls were flipped) much faster than a normal neural net, which had to learn each game from scratch. The basic layout of a progressive neural network. (Image credit: DeepMind / Raia Hadsell) It’s a promising method, and in more recent experiments it’s even been applied to robotic arms — speeding up their learning process from a matter of weeks to just a single day. However, there are significant limitations, with Hadsell noting that progressive neural networks can’t simply keep on adding new tasks to their memory. If you keep chaining systems together, sooner or later you end up with a model that is "too large to be tractable," she says. And that’s when the different tasks being managed are essentially similar — creating a human-level intelligence that can write a poem, solve differential equations, and design a chair is something else altogether. It's only real intelligence if you can show your working Another major challenge is understanding how artificial intelligence reaches its conclusions in the first place. Neural networks are usually inscrutable to observers. Although we know how they’re put together and the information that goes in them, the reasons why they come to certain decisions usually goes unexplained. AI looks for curtains on the floor — not on the windows A good demonstration of this problem comes from an experiment at Virginia Tech. Researchers created what is essentially an eye-tracking system for a neural network, which records which pixels the computer looks at first. The researchers showed the neural net pictures of a bedroom and asked the AI: "What is covering the windows?" They found that instead of looking at the windows, the AI looked at the floor. Then, if it found a bed, it gave the answer "there are curtains covering the windows." This happened to be right, but only because of the limited data the network had been trained on. Based on the pictures it had been shown, the neural net had deduced that if it was in a bedroom there would be curtains on the windows. So when it saw a bed, it stopped looking — it had, in its eyes, seen curtains. Logical, of course, but also daft. A lot of bedrooms don’t have curtains! Eye-tracking is one way of shining some light on the inner workings, but another might be to build more coherence into deep learning systems from the get-go. One way of doing this is revisiting an old, unfashionable strand of artificial intelligence known as symbolic AI or Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI), says Murray Shanahan, a professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London (and also the scientific advisor on Ex Machina). This is based on the hypothesis that what goes on in the mind can be reduced to basic logic, where the world is defined by a complex dictionary of symbols. By combining these symbols — which represent actions, events, objects, etc. — you can basically synthesize thinking. (If creating an AI this way sounds like a monstrous, unthinkable task, just imagine trying it on computers that still run on magnetic tape.) Shanahan’s proposal is that we take the symbolic descriptions of GOFAI and combine them with deep learning. These would provide the systems with a starting point for understanding the world, rather than just feeding them data and waiting for them to notice patterns. This, he says, might not only solve the transparency problem of AI, but also the problem of transfer learning outlined by Hadsell. "It’s all very well to say that Breakout is similar to Pong because they’ve both got paddles and balls, but human level cognition makes these types of connections on a much more dramatic scale," says Shanahan. "Like the connection between the structure of the atom and the structure of the solar system." Shanahan and his team at Imperial are working on the new method (which they call deep symbolic reinforcement learning) and have published some small experiments. It’s still in its infancy, and finding out whether it will scale up to larger systems and different types of data will be telling. However, there’s every chance it could develop into something more. After all, deep learning itself was an unloved department of AI until researchers began to plug in the cheap data and abundant processing power made available in recent years. Maybe it’s time for another blast from AI’s past to try its skills in a new environment.

The December update is expected to come with an improvised JavaScripot engine that will reduce the RAM consumed by the browser to half.   Recomended Google is Finally Working On Fixing Chrome’s High Resource Usage Issue [Updated]   Google Chrome – Top 5 New Features Expected Soon   Google Chrome Now Comes with Mute Button for Individual Tabs, Helps Deal with Auto-playing Video Menace   Google Chrome browser is known to be resource hogging and this is one aspect of the browser that has proven to be Achilles heels over the time. Google has been making tall claims of future updates to make the Chrome browser frugal but sadly not much has been materialized in the recent past. Now, with the web pages loaded with several intuitive features it only becomes natural for the browser to be burdened with the task of taking care of additional resources, thus the memory management is of prime importance here.   Google’s Chromium team is currently working on improving the browser and is expected to consume half the RAM as opposed to now. This is possible all thanks to a new JavaScript engine in the Chrome 54. According to Google sites including Reddit, Twitter, The New York Times and YouTube were using 50 percent less RAM which is a feat indeed. Also, you will be able to see how Chrome browser will be able to handle a high number of open tabs with relative ease without giving up. These improvisations will go a long way for folks using machines with low specs. This just seems to be the beginning for the Chromium team which is striving to optimise the browsing experience for low-end machines with less than 1GB of RAM. The stable build is slated to go live on December 6th and if you want to check it right away you can do so by downloading the Beta from the Chrome Beta Channel but be warned that the Beta might surprise you with a few unexpected bugs. Personally, Chrome has been my primary browser but it starts lagging and getting sluggish if I open more than 10 tabs on my Notebook. Crashes due to low RAM is also not something new (especially on my Notebook that has 2GB of RAM). At the same time, it is very tough for me to ditch the convenience of the Chrome browser and the ease with which it syncs up my browsing data with the Android browser. If Google’s memory optimization works as touted it can turn out to be a world of difference for most of its users.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 13:54, Tue, Oct 11, 2016 | UPDATED: 13:54, Tue, Oct 11, 2016 GETTYGoogle has bundled a number of exclusive software features with the Pixel and Pixel XL The Pixel and Pixel XL were unveiled on-stage in San Francisco last week, alongside a number of new products from Google. The flagship smartphones are the first to be designed and "made" by Google.  Pixel and Pixel XL will showcase the US search firm’s vision of Android devices. That’s not something we’ve seen from Google before. Both the 5-inch Pixel and larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL phablet run Android 7.1 Nougat. However, the software on these flagship smartphones is a little different. Google has included a number of exclusive features into the operating system that customers with Samsung, LG, Nexus or other Android devices will not see anytime soon. First up – Google Assistant. GETTYPixel and Pixel XL are the first phones to come with the Google Assistant preinstalled In a nutshell, the Google Assistant is a personified version of the Google Now panel that has been a mainstay since Android 4.1 Jelly Bean.  The Assistant is summoned by saying "OK  Google" on pressing and holding on the Home Button at the bottom of the display. Talking to the virtual Assistant takes the form of a text conversation, with speech bubbles displaying your questions and Google’s responses. Google is smart enough to understand follow-up questions, so you can ask “How many Grammy Awards has Adele won?” followed by “How old is she?”. Google Assistant is able to work-out that your second question refers back to the artist mentioned in the first. Google Assistant is also able to analyse and read what is currently displayed on your display. So you can ask it to “remind me about it this tomorrow at 9am”. There are also some small tweaks – like the dynamic calendar icon that changes to display the current date within the app icon. Google has also included 24/7 customer support. This is another exclusive feature for the Pixel and Pixel XL, and reinforces Google's new emphasis on consumers. Included within a dedicated panel in the Settings app, the 24/7 customer support screen lets Pixel owners quickly start a text or phone conversation with a Google expert.  GOOGLEUK customers can buy the Quite Black and Very Silver variations in store on October 20th Like Amazon’s MayDay feature, you can choose to share your screen with the support staff who will walk you step-by-step to a solution. Google is also offering Pixel and Pixel XL owners unlimited storage for full-resolution photographs and videos in the cloud with Google Photos.  Once you’ve captured the moment, Google Photos keeps all your photos backed up, organised, and searchable, so you can find and share them with friends and family via your favourite chat app or social media feed. If you do not own a Pixel or Pixel XL, it is possible to upload all of your family snaps to Google Photos free of charge. However, this is limited to images 16-megapixels or under and 1080p high definition video. Google Pixel and Pixel XL owners are able to back-up 4K Ultra HD video shot on the device's hugely-impressive camera without flashing the cash. GOOGLEGoogle Assistant is the pre-emptive Google Now panel, personified Pixel and Pixel XL's camera app also bundles a few exclusive features. Google has also implemented a number of nifty software tricks into its camera app, including Smart Burst, which uses software to pick-out the sharpest, clearest image when taking a burst, and HDR+, which ensures you always get great photos, even in low light, while processing the picture twice as fast to allow for rapid fire shots.  There’s also video stabilisation to improve the quality of your home movies, even if you are shooting while walking or jogging. Express.co.uk got the opportunity to test out the Pixel and Pixel XL last week. Here are our initial impressions of the flagship smartphone from Google.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Apple iPhone vs. Google Android: Battle of Smartphone Lineups; Which Device Environment is Right for You? Price Details and Features Compared By Christian Ver Marcelo Oct 10, 2016 | 2:18 AM The war over which smartphone environment is better has been ongoing since the dawn of modern-age technology. With Apple dishing out their absolute best in the iPhone devices and Google answering back with even more innovations through the Android phones, which one should you pick? Device Diversity Up until the iPhone 5S, Apple fans are stuck with only one option per released model, with only the storage capacity and device colors being the main difference. With the iPhone 6 and future models, however, the Plus lineup was introduced, giving rise to 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch options. On the Android side, however, diversity is key. As there are several manufacturers competing and adapting the Android brand, customers are bombarded with a plethora of options. There's a diverse collection of features, screen sizes, carriers, materials, designs, colors, and a whole lot more. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Software Updates The main problem with Android's diversity is fragmentation. As there are tons of devices and manufacturers, as well as the carriers, updating the devices usually take a lot longer. Aside from Google's own Nexus and Pixel phones, software developers and programmers from other manufacturers still customize their proprietary software over Android first before rolling out updates. For Apple, nothing could be quite simpler and more direct than their over-the-air software updates. They integrate the updates seamlessly through the iOS, with a uniform and cohesive experience throughout all the devices, so cross-platform usage is definitely not a hassle. Customizability Perhaps the department where Android significantly trumps the iPhone is in customizability. There are options for different wallpapers, lock screens, fonts, widgets, launchers, and every other trinket that users can think of customizing. This is just not possible with the iPhone, where the device gives you only the things that the company thinks you need. Apps and Bloatware Apps in both these devices are largely similar, with developers creating software compatible with both environments. However, apps are launched on the App Store most of the time, with the Google Play Store following suit. Also, whichever carrier you choose to buy an iPhone from, there is a guarantee that only the native apps are loaded. This is especially advantageous over the Android, where, aside from the native Google apps, there are also apps from the manufacturer and the carrier. Performance, Features and Security For performance, there is no question that the hardware and software integration of the iPhone works absolutely great to its advantage. Even with perceived lower specs than some Android devices, the iPhone could still hold its own when used in real life. Also, Apple's security with their devices is insurmountable by any other platform. Along with the diversity, the performance and features of Android vary as well. There are entry-level light performers, mid-range capable ones, and high end speedy phones. Features vary as well, with some focusing on the camera, audio, security, productivity, ruggedness, and others. Suffice to say, there is an Android phone built for everyone's specific needs. Support With Android devices being fragmented by manufacturer and carrier, customer service experience may be a bit inconsistent. There are high quality, professional service providers, and definitely those that are sketchier and amateurish. Apple's customer support has never faltered ever since. Part of the experience of owning an iPhone, or any Apple device for that matter, is walking through an Apple Store, ask for help, and get it right away. While device maintenance and repair may cost higher, the quality of service you are getting is certainly a premium one too. Price Apple's iPhones are marketed as premium devices from the get go. Its market value has not flinched over the years that it has existed, and rightfully so. With the top-notch quality and service that Apple is providing with the iPhones, it's not just the device customers are paying for, but the entire experience itself. For the Android system, however, this is not the case. There is certainly a device for every budget. There are low cost, budget-friendly devices, there are mid-rangers that perform like high-end smartphones, and actual high-end smartphones that come at a premium price.

Not for much longer, says Google Google is tackling high memory consumption by its Chrome browser, promising major improvements, especially for mobile devices. By Liam Tung | October 10, 2016 -- 12:48 GMT (05:48 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Google's figures for low-memory devices since Chrome 53 suggest a 50 percent reduction in average heap memory consumption. Image: Google Google says the new version of Chrome that's in the pipeline will be less of a drag on your precious phone or PC memory. The claimed improvements are on the way in the form of Chrome 55, due out in December, with a new V8 JavaScript engine. Benchmarking tests from Google have shown Chrome can deliver a "significantly reduced" memory footprint when visiting several popular websites, according to its developers. Google built V8 to ensure Chrome was speedy when loading complex websites, but in pursuit of speed the browser has also gained a reputation as a memory hog that slows down the one billion machines it's running on. Key optimizations in Chrome 55 come via 'garbage collector', a feature it introduced last year that cleans out unused memory from Chrome. Google has also fine-tuned V8 for low-memory mobile devices and in tests on The New York Times mobile site achieved 66 percent reduction in average V8 'heap' memory consumption. It posted smaller reductions on several other popular sites, including Facebook, Hacker News, and The Washington Post. The company has also made improvements to V8's handling of 'zone' or temporary memory used in Chrome, with reductions of about 40 percent. Over the coming months it plans to focus on further optimizations for smartphones, targeting devices with RAM of between 512MB and 1GB.

October 10 AAPL: 116.05 1.99 Comment: Samsung’s literal meltdown will mostly benefit Google & LG, but should help Apple too Ben Lovejoy - 1 month ago @benlovejoy Feature AAPL Samsung View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit You might have thought things couldn’t get any worse for Samsung after a series of fires and explosions forced it to recall its flagship Galaxy Note 7. It had already been forced to recall almost 2.5 million devices at an estimated cost of a billion dollars, with all U.S. major carriers offering customers the option to return replacement devices also. But things have now gotten worse. Much worse. The Verge has found that no fewer than five replacement devices have caught fire in the U.S. alone. When it was just one case, I cautioned against jumping to conclusions, but with five separate fires in such a short time, we’re well beyond the point of being able to ascribe this to the simple statistics of lithium battery failures. All four major U.S. carriers have now pulled the Note 7 altogether, and Samsung has ‘temporarily’ halted production of replacement Note 7s … Right now, Samsung is trying to spin this as a temporary suspension – but it’s honestly hard to see how the Note 7 could possibly make a comeback from this. With both the original and replacement models now considered too dangerous to sell, who would be willing to risk their own safety, and the safety of their home and family, by giving Samsung a third chance? At this point, Samsung might as well write-off this year’s flagship phone as a lost cause, and focus its efforts on ensuring that nothing at all goes wrong with next year’s Galaxy Note 8. Even then, it’s likely that consumers will be cautious. I’m guessing many will decide to at least wait a few weeks after launch to find out whether next year’s phone is safe. But the damage done to Samsung’s reputation and prospects could well extend far beyond this year and next. The majority of existing Note 7 owners are going to replace the device with something else, and if they are happy with their new device, they may not return to Samsung in subsequent years. The main beneficiaries are likely to be Google and LG. Google has just launched its Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the successors to the old Nexus range. It never put much of a marketing push behind the Nexus models, but appears to be making a much bigger splash with the Pixel. For techies looking to replace their Note 7, the Pixel is probably going to be top of the list. It’s a true flagship device, with what appears to be a great camera for stills and video alike. But the biggest selling-point for anyone living in the Android world is the software exclusives it offers. Android 7.1 is – for now at least – exclusive to the new Pixel phones. Google’s Siri competitor, Google Assistant, looks set to remain a Pixel-only feature for some time. Plus you get unlimited full-quality photo and video backup to the cloud for the life of the device. That’s a better deal than anyone else offers. My namesake over at 9to5Google, Ben Schoon, says the software rather than the hardware is the reason he bought one. If Google continues to promote the phone as aggressively as it has done so far, many non-techies are likely to be persuaded too For those whose priority is similar hardware to the Note 7, the LG V20 is also a natural successor. With its edge-to-edge screen and curved design, those buying on looks may see it as the next best thing. Techies are probably not going to abandon Android for an iPhone. Most are pretty deeply embedded into either Apple or Android ecosystems, and switching platforms would be a major hassle. But it’s easy to forget that’s not true for most normals. For them, a smartphone is a smartphone. They all do the things they want, and the mainstream apps they use are all available on both platforms, so they largely buy on cute hardware. For the average mass-market consumer out there, it’s not that big a deal to switch from Android to iOS. Which means that Apple, too, is likely to benefit from Samsung’s woes. When a Note 7 owner looks around to see what else is available out there, the iPhone 7 is going to be on their radar. People have been switching from Android to iOS in significant numbers for some time now, and the Note 7 disaster is likely to add substantially to their number. So what is extremely bad news for Samsung is likely to end up being at least moderately good news for Apple. We won’t see those numbers factoring into the earnings Apple reports on October 25, but its Q1 2017 numbers are going to make for interesting reading.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 14, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Guide to Google ranking factors – Part 6: Trust, Authority and Expertise SEO 10 Oct 16 | Christopher Ratcliff Facebook0 Linkedin77 Google+25 Twitter 102 Last week we published the fifth instalment of our complete guide to Google ranking factors. It concentrated on ‘duplicate content and syndication’ and the practical ways you can ensure your webpages are passing on PageRank and not being ignored by Google. This week we dive into trust signals, paying particular attention to Google’s Page Quality Rating. Page Quality Rating Last year, Google published an extensive document laying out exactly what it looks for when it comes to evaluating your search quality. In order to work out your Page Quality Rating, Google takes into account the following most important factors: Main content quality and amount Website information/information about who is responsible for the website Website reputation Expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness We’ve already looked at ‘quality content’ in a previous instalment of this guide, so let’s explore the remaining three elements: trust, authority and expertise. Authority As stated in our article on what is an authority website? An authority website is a site that is trusted. It’s trusted by its users, trusted by industry experts, trusted by other websites and trusted by search engines. The strength of your authority will ultimately come down to the strength of your website’s content, which we’ve covered in earlier chapters. There are also many other on-site areas where a site can build trust and authority… Site Architecture 1) Your site needs to have a logical architecture. The homepage should be accessible at all times, and all your categories and subcategories should be thematically grouped together in your main navigation. 2) An easily accessible search box will aid the user experience, and help people looking for more specific information. If a searcher can’t find a specific page, make sure your search results offer something in a way that’s still relevant. 3) All your categories should be accessible from the main menu. All your web pages should be labelled with the relevant categories. Identity 4) Your website should have an easy to locate Contact Us page with an appropriate amount of contact information – emails, business address, business phone number. 5) Your Contact Page’s information should also match your WHOIS data. 6) An About Us page explaining your website’s purpose, it’s history and including profiles of your owners and senior employees will help engender trust in visitors. 4) On every webpage it should be clear who is responsible for the website (whether individual, organisation or publisher) and who created the content on the page (the author).

Not only will this keep your site up-to-date with fresh content and encourage repeat visits (and increase the frequency of search engine crawlers), but also show that you’re a relevant, trustworthy business. 6) User reviews and testimonials that you’ve uploaded yourself onto a webpage will probably be ignored by Google’s Page Quality rating. Instead Google pays attention to third-party expert testimonials from independent sources – reviews, references, news articles. Recommendations from professional societies, are strong evidence of very positive reputation. 7) A few negative customer reviews aren’t going to affect your Page Quality rating too much, particularly if you have thousands. Customer reviews also tend to be checked for their content rather than the actual rating itself. That being said, you clearly need to rethink your product or customer service if negativity begins to increase. 8) You must include a Terms of Service and Privacy Policy explaining your use of cookies. Expertise 9) If you purport to be an expert site, then you’d better make sure you have experts writing for you. Even if you’re site is an entertainment site or fashion blog. To use a few of Google’s own examples: High quality medical advice should come from people or organizations with appropriate medical expertise or accreditation. High quality medical advice or information should be written or produced in a professional style and should be edited, reviewed, and updated on a regular basis. High quality advice pages on topics such as home remodeling or advice on parenting issues should also come from “expert” or experienced sources which users can trust. High quality pages on hobbies, such as photography or learning to play a guitar, also require expertise. Google will routinely check on the ongoing quality of your ‘expert’ site. 10) Don’t worry if you don’t have any formal training or education in your chosen area, Google will take into account the “amount of life experience” that makes them an expert on the topic and will value this as “everyday expertise.” Other instalments in our Google ranking factor guide: For more chapters in our Google ranking factors series, check out: Part 10: backlinks Part 9: outbound links Part 8: internal links Part 7: site-level signals Part 5: duplicate content and syndication.

With the launch of Project Fi, Google told the world what it thinks about the role of the mobile operator in connectivity service provision. By requiring its operator partners to compete for the right to connect the end user wherever their networks overlap — with one another, or with freely shared Wi-Fi — Google puts its ‘partners’ in what it clearly believes is their rightful place. Nobody forced Google’s three wholesale partners to participate, of course. One particularly mischievous element of Project Fi is that, by design, it promises to reward the wholesale partner with the best-performing network; something which, in one way or another, most mobile operators claim to have. No doubt there will be upside for Project Fi’s wholesale suppliers, in the short term at least. Google also has some rather important device partners, between them responsible for putting the Android OS and its wider ecosystem into billions of hands worldwide. There is a mutual dependency at play here: Google needs vendors to create products, vendors need Android in order to play in a market which appears unable to sustain a third mobile platform. And yet Google seems just as intent on provoking device vendors as it does network operators. In August this year, Google made Wi-Fi Assistant — the software element which auto-connects Project Fi devices to certain public Wi-Fi networks — available to all Nexus-brand Android smartphones across a number of key markets. The benefit of Wi-Fi Assistant to the MVNO play is clear; whenever customers are connected to Wi-Fi, Project Fi slips the leash of its wholesale costs. But there is no such upside in giving it to all Nexus users in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the UK, and Nordic countries, where Wi-Fi Assistant will soon be available. Instead Google positions the development as a user benefit; a means of slashing cellular data costs and maintaining high quality smartphone connectivity irrespective of the mobile network’s reach and capacity in the moment. It appears now that building Wi-Fi Assistant into these devices was part of Google’s groundwork for a more muscular approach to the handset market, an approach which took physical form with the introduction last week of the Pixel, which will replace the Nexus sub-brand from here on in. The Pixel, the first device for which Google has closely controlled both the hardware and software, will of course be available on Project Fi. But it will also be supplied by a number of top tier mobile operators internationally, as outlined in Google’s announcements last week. A smartphone which automatically connects to a pool of shared public Wi-Fi networks to augment the experience and reduce cost is valuably and tangibly differentiated. The beauties of individual vendors’ interpretations of Android are, both by comparison and definition, largely skin-deep. The availability of Wi-Fi Assistant on Google’s devices suggests the firm is asking serious questions of competing Android devices from leading vendors: “What does this smartphone do to improve its owners’ connectivity experience? How does it keep them online at indoor locations where the mobile data service is found wanting? How does it save them money?” It raises the bar for Android smartphone comparisons. The spread of Wi-Fi Assistant delivers other significant benefits to Google. While it cannot test international enthusiasm for the full-fat Fi experience, offering a core piece of it to millions of consumers through a simple software upgrade will yield important insights into potential demand. And, of course, it allows Google to rattle the operators’ cages with a little more vigour. With Wi-Fi Assistant on all its branded devices, Google is positioning itself to move operators’ customers, using operator-supplied (and in some cases subsidized) devices, away from operators’ own networks. End users no longer have to be customers of Google’s MVNO to allow Google to insert itself between them and the operator, empowering it with the responsibility for key connectivity decisions. Moreover, as with Project Fi in the U.S., Google will be able to use Wi-Fi Assistant to build an understanding of precisely when and where Wi-Fi delivers a measurable improvement to the user experience offered by mobile operators. The wider deployment of Wi-Fi Assistant may have been positioned as a small step, made public with the minimum possible fanfare, and drowned out by the flurry of announcements in early October. But it can be convincingly read as part of a larger effort by Google to drive fundamental and lasting change in the power structure of the mobile industry. Next week, Dave Fraser considers the possibility that Project Fi prefigures Google’s plans for mobile industry disruption on a far wider scale.   Dave Fraser has been designing, building, marketing, and managing software for more than 30 years. He was instrumental in the development of Devicescape’s Curated Virtual Network and the connectivity, engagement and insight services it enables for operators, app developers, and consumer brands. Prior to joining Devicescape, Dave worked for Wind River (acquired by Intel), holding a variety of executive positions including chief marketing officer, and senior VP product business. He previously held senior roles at Convergent Technologies and Hewlett-Packard.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google ditches Hangouts for Duo Software Google ditches Hangouts for Duo By Sohil Nikam - Google is ditching Hangouts going by a new report, making the application optional instead of mandatory in Android devices. It apparently plans to place its two-month-old popular video chat app Google Duo in its place. According to an email Google sent to its Mobile Services partners on October 5, the brand does not need Hangouts to be shipped within the suite of core GMS apps starting from December 1. Google Duo will be replacing it on the same day. However, the missive doesn’t necessarily mean the older app has been killed. Original Device Manufacturers can still choose to include it with their products, though they would probably prefer to drop it and push their own apps instead. If they do choose to get rid of it, Hangouts users could always download it via the Play Store to continue having access to it. Also Read: Google outs Daydream View, Chromecast Ultra, Google WiFi, Google Home Google is supposedly planning to continue support for Hangouts in spite of this demotion. As for its usurper, Duo is a slightly odd choice for a replacement. The search giant’s AI-powered chat app Allo seems like the more natural choice, especially given the wide array of rivals Google has to compete against in that sector. Android Police theorizes that video calling as a core OS feature may be a major priority for Google. With that in mind, the company may feel like it’s important to push Duo now when the segment is still littered with applications possessing limited abilities.

So I asked Google's Gary Illyes on Friday if Panda (the content based quality algorithm) demotes or devalues and Gary said it does adjust rankings of pages, which is unlike Penguin which just ignores (devalues) the bad links. My question: @methode does Panda devalue, demote or both?— Barry Schwartz (@rustybrick) October 7, 2016 Here is Gary's response: @rustybrick anyway, panda adjusts ranking of pages based on quality of the site.— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 7, 2016 He was careful in his response, but I did later get him to go on record that this means more like demote than devalue. I'll share that shortly. In addition, John Mueller was asked about this in the Friday hangout and he said "I don't have any specific answer for that." He then goes onto non Panda related algorithms on how they do that, for example with keyword stuffing. Here is the video embed: I don't think this is a surprise to anyone but getting it clear for SEOs and webmasters is helpful. Forum discussion at Twitter. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Daily Search Forum Recap: October 7, 2016   Comments: Dan Richardson 10/10/2016 01:00 pm Cheers Baz Snuffy 10/10/2016 01:05 pm "panda adjusts ranking of pages based on quality of the site." Sounds to me like panda whacks your entire site, rather than considering each page on its own. What do you think? Deadpool 10/10/2016 01:09 pm Obvious as hell Dan Richardson 10/10/2016 01:45 pm Agreed ds 10/10/2016 02:33 pm what a stupid question Michael Martinez 10/10/2016 02:38 pm It's similar to questions we asked in 2011 that went unanswered, so it's not a stupid question at all. At least Google is willing to be more forthcoming about how Panda operates now. ads 10/10/2016 04:05 pm The question is invalid if the person understands Panda. You obviously do not Simon 10/10/2016 04:20 pm Watch the Hangout. The question to John (by me) was whether or not Panda will in the future start devaluing rather than demoting site-wide, given that Google has taken the decision to do this with Penguin. John's reply suggested Panda is already purely devaluing at a granular level to some extent, rather then demoting. Barry then tried to clarify this with Gary.

Google Tests Numerous UI Changes for the Play Store One of the changes is a renamed Entertainment section Oct 10, 2016 11:55 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Earlier this year, Google added eight new app categories to the Play Store and the company continues to make changes in order to improve the experience of users and developers. Apparently, Google is currently working on several new UI changes to the Store. Among the UI updates Google is prepping for the Play Store there is a new Entertainment section and a different look for the carousel, according to Android Police. In addition, the tech giant is thinking about removing the search bar in the Play Store and is also working on a new Google Play Store banner. The Entertainment section will have a more descriptive title: Movies, Music, Books. However, the long text does seem to look a bit weird on devices with lower resolution. The featured items carousel will get a new look, as Google decided to move it down and make the slides smaller. This makes it easier to scroll through featured items. Previously, the carousel spanned from end to end and stood on top of the home page. Changes were also brought to the search bar, which will be hidden by default. Users would have to tap on the search icon at the top in order to expand the bar and type in the name of the app they wish to find. The search bar is currently located at the top of the screen and it provides instant access to voice search. The change could require users to perform an extra tap in order to use voice search. It remains to be seen if Google will actually implement all the changes in an update or only a few will make it to the app.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Google#Play Store#UI changes#New sections#Search bar reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google tests UI changes (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Duo to Replace Hangouts as the Main Video-Chatting App for Android Phones Prisma Gets Offline Mode on Android and Video Editing Features on iOS Shazam Announced New Lightweight Application, Shazam Lite Facebook Launches Lifestage, iOS App for Teenagers Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 4 photos    Google Play Store logo New Android APKs Facebook Messenger APK: Updated November 14th, 06:30 GMT Facebook APK: Updated November 14th, 06:28 GMT Facebook APK: Updated November 14th, 06:23 GMT PokéMesh APK: Updated November 14th, 06:20 GMT Taskbar APK: Updated November 14th, 06:16 GMT Google Sheets APK: Updated November 14th, 06:13 GMT Maps APK: Updated November 14th, 05:23 GMT Reader comments Samsung Already Capable of Mass Producing Foldable Smartphones but It's Cautious more on: Samsung foldable phone i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

By Liam Tung | October 10, 2016 -- 11:35 GMT (04:35 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Google's methodology could have applications in any scoring system, such as a bank's credit-scoring system. Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto In an age where data is driving decisions about everything from creditworthiness, to insurance and criminal justice, machines could well end up making bad predictions that just reflect and reinforce past discrimination. The Obama Administration outlined its concerns about this issue in its 2014 big-data report, warning that automated discrimination against certain groups could be the inadvertent outcome of the way big-data technologies are used. AI, MD: How artificial intelligence is changing the way illness is diagnosed and treated While privacy and regulation will slow the pace of adoption, AI will bring some profound changes to healthcare. Read More Using social networks or location data to assess a person's creditworthiness could boost access to finance for people who don't have a credit history. However, big-data techniques might also raise barriers to finance and, since a decision could be made by a proprietary algorithm, there'd be no way to challenge the decision. To address this threat to minority groups, the White House has called for "equal opportunity by design". But as three Google researchers note in a new paper, there currently is no vetted methodology for avoiding discrimination against sensitive attributes in machine learning. "Consider the case of a group that we have relatively little data on and whose characteristics differ from those of the general population in ways that are relevant to the prediction task," writes Moritz Hardt, a research scientist on the Google Brain Team and one of the paper's authors. "As prediction accuracy is generally correlated with the amount of data available for training, it is likely that incorrect predictions will be more common in this group. A predictor might, for example, end up flagging too many individuals in this group as 'high risk of default' even though they pay back their loan," Hardt notes. "When group membership coincides with a sensitive attribute, such as race, gender, disability, or religion, this situation can lead to unjust or prejudicial outcomes." One approach might be "fairness through unawareness" or removing a sensitive attribute from the equation, but as Hardt acknowledges, an algorithm could still end up inferring that attribute based on a combination of other data points. Another approach, called "demographic parity", would require a prediction to be uncorrelated with the sensitive attribute, but Hardt argues in the case of predicting medical conditions such as heart failure, it's "neither realistic nor desirable to prevent all correlation between the predicted outcome and group membership". Google's attempt to navigate these issues starts with the concept of "equality of opportunity" in machine learning, built on the idea that "individuals who qualify for a desirable outcome should have an equal chance of being correctly classified for this outcome". In a credit context, if there are two groups who have applied for a loan, the same proportion of each should get the loan instead of allowing race or gender to influence the decision. The methodology could have applications in any scoring system, such as a bank's credit-scoring system that uses thresholds to determine whether a person should get a loan. According to Hardt, its methodology not only can measure and prevent discrimination based on sensitive attributes but also help scrutinize predictors. It also allows for adjustments to be made to predictors so that the user can choose between classification accuracy and non-discrimination. The methodology makes it possible to address discrimination in scoring systems, even for those who don't control the underlying system, and provides organizations with an incentive to invest in better scoring systems, according to Google Research. "When implemented, our framework also improves incentives by shifting the cost of poor predictions from the individual to the decision maker, who can respond by investing in improved prediction accuracy," writes Hardt. "Perfect predictors always satisfy our notion, showing that the central goal of building more accurate predictors is well aligned with the goal of avoiding discrimination." But the researchers admit that mathematics alone won't be able to tackle discrimination in machine learning.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (9) Post your comment Google is testing a few substantial UI changes for the Play Store 10 October 2016 Google is no stranger to redesign. Thus, it is hardly surprising to hear that the online titan is currently testing yet another tweak to the design of the Play Store. New "Entertainment" category First off, Google apparently felt that the "Entertainment" section was a bit too vague. The suggested replacement is the much more descriptive title - "MOVIES, MUSIC, BOOKS". This might save some confusion, although we doubt too many users are currently looking for books in the games department, but the long text does look somewhat questionable on a lower-res device. The featured items carousel also has a new suggested look. Instead of spanning from end to end and standing on top of the home page, behind the search bar, like in the first two shots, Google has decided to move it down and make the slides smaller, so you can get a better visual sense that there are more items to scroll through. New carousel Speaking of the search bar, it now behaves and looks a bit differently as well. Currently, the home screen has a big search box out in a fixed position at the top. That means it is generally the first thing you encounter when you open the platform and it also provides instant access to voice search (not that we think many people use it to begin with). In this new look, Google seems to be putting a lot less emphasis on the search functionality. The bar is hidden by default and can be expanded by tapping on the search icon in the top right. Since, currently search is invisible in most of the Play Store interface as well, this isnt really that much of a change. If you happen to rely on voice search, however, there is an extra tap involved. New search Lastly, there is a new splash screen in the updated GUI. It appears for a few moments when opening an external link to an app and seems to be there purely to promote the Play Store itself. It does have the potential to become a nuisance and might not make it to prime time. Speaking of which, it is important to note that all of these tweaks are currently being seeded by Google server-side as a pretty wide-spread beta test. We are yet to see, whether all or any of them will make it to a final release. Source Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- The somewhat glitzy launch that Google announced the Pixel XL with was symbolic of the seriousness with which the corporation is taking this handset, and it is hoped that the Android-driven device can rival major market players such as the iPhone 7. The launch of the Pixel XL is a landmark moment for Google, representing the first time that the software giant has fully designed every component of a smartphone. Considering the size and scope of the Pixel XL, Google is effectively pitching the technology against the iiPhone 7 Plus phablet. So how do the handsets compare to one another? Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus – Size The Pixel XL is marginally smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus, with the latter measuring 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches, and the former 6.1 x 3.0 x 0.3 inches. Naturally, this also means that the iPhone 7 Plus is a tiny bit slimmer than the Pixel XL, something that Apple has always prided itself on. Weight The iPhone 7 Plus is just over 10 percent heavier than the Pixel XL. The Apple phablet weighs in at 6.63 ounces, while the new Google contender weighs just 5.90 ounces. Considering that the Apple handset is only very slightly larger, this is a good achievement from Google. Display It is not hugely surprising that the display in the Pixel XL outperforms the iPhone 7 Plus, and in all honesty the resolution of the Apple smartphone is seriously due an upgrade. Google has announced that the Pixel XL offers quad HD resolution, while the iPhone 7 Plus is only full HD. This means that the Pixel XL is capable of displaying 25 percent more pixels per inch than the iPhone 7 Plus; 543 as opposed to 401. Apple must surely upgrade the iPhone 7 Plus to quad HD when the next generation iPhone 8 is released, as quad HD is becoming an industry standard, and it is possible that its great rival Samsung will introduce 4K resolution technology in its smartphone range in 2017. Camera It remains to be seen precisely what Google will deliver with the Pixel XL camera, and the iPhone 7 Plus is notable for possessing several valuable and innovative features. But the raw specs do suggest that the new Google device will compete favorably with the iPhone 7 Plus, with the former featuring a 12.3-megapixel snapper. This is slightly superior to the 12-megapixel unit included in the iPhone 7 Plus, although Google has been relatively coy regarding other features included in its camera. Meanwhile, the front-facing snapper in the Pixel XL is also superior to the equivalent iPhone 7 Plus device. The new Google release features an eight-megapixel camera compared to the seven-megapixel unit included in the iPhone 7 Plus. Battery Again, we cannot be entirely sure of the battery life of which the Google Pixel XL is capable, as numerous factors can contribute to the performance of a smartphone in this department. There is no doubt that Apple has significantly improved the battery lifecycle of the iPhone range in the iPhone 7 generation, and also the size of the battery. But the Google Pixel XL will feature a larger cell than the iPhone 7 Plus. The mega-corporation has indicated that the Pixel XL possesses a 3,450 mAh battery, which is more than 15 percent larger than the 2,900 mAH cell that was included in the iPhone 7 Plus. Whether this will translate into superior real world performance is doubtful, as the most recent version of Android has been somewhat more greedy on battery power than the latest iOS operating system. Storage Apple rightfully improved the storage capacity of the iPhone range significantly when the corporation announced the iPhone 7 series, and the choice it provided to consumers with the iPhone 7 Plus is superior to any other mainstream smartphone. With the largest storage version of the iPhone 7 Plus being 256GB, and 32GB and 128GB versions also available, there are good options available for consumers with the market leading Apple flagship. By contrast, Google has decided not to offer a 256GB version of its smartphone, which is slightly surprising considering the premium which is placed on storage by modern media. Memory Apple has always relied on its combination of proprietary hardware and software to ensure that the iPhone range punches above its weight. And this has meant that traditionally the iPhone series has less memory than many other smartphone competitors. This trend was repeated with the iPhone 7. Although the iPhone 7 Plus received an upgrade in memory, it still only contains 3GB of RAM. This is less than the Google handset, with the Pixel XL being fitted with 4GB of memory as standard. Conclusion All of the evidence from the early information on the Pixel XL suggests that Google has certainly packed its smartphone with impressive specs. This has always been a tactic of Samsung, with the Galaxy range noted for its outstanding specs over the years. It certainly seems that the Pixel XL will compete evenly with the Galaxy Note and Galaxy S series, and certainly is beefier than the iPhone 7 Plus in most categories. This won’t necessarily translate into superior performance, with Apple always optimizing the performance of the iPhone handset via software efficiency. And the interface and operating system utilized by the iPhone 7 Plus arguably remains the slickest on the markets. Apple, of course, can also call on the unrivalled iPhone branding, which has played a massive part in establishing the Californian corporation as the most powerful consumer electronics company on the planet. Google will have some hard work on its hands to convince customers to switch to one of its smartphones, and establish the sort of brand identity and loyalty that Apple now almost takes for granted, despite the recognisability of Google to everyday consumers. It seems that the Google Pixel XL is a very credible smartphone contender, and possibly one that can establish itself as a mainstream device. Whether it can have eve seriously rival the dominant iPhone is extremely doubtful.         LATEST STORIES (9) Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US TEHRAN (FNA)- Chanting “Not my president” and “love trumps hate,” hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in cities across the United States to protest against President-elect Donald Trump, who they say threatens their civil and human rights.

More from Google's analysis, shared with NBC News: · Clinton and Trump are tied with 50 percent each in candidate search interest across Google · Search interest in "vote for Trump" was 30 percent higher than search interest in "vote for Clinton" · Search interest in "Clinton website" was 130 percent higher than search interest in "Trump website" Facebook Twitter Email Emma Margolin Clinton Spokesman's Message to Trump: 'Go F*** Yourself' A spokesman for Hillary Clinton reacted hotly to comments made by Donald Trump Sunday night as the second presidential debate shifted to Capt. Humayun S.M. Khan, an American soldier who was killed in Iraq in 2004. Clinton brought up attacks her Republican rival has launched at Khan's parents, who are Muslim, following their emotional remarks at the Democratic National Convention in July. Shortly after the Khans' appearance at the DNC, Trump suggested Clinton's team had scripted their speech and questioned whether Khan's mother "wasn't allowed to have anything to say." During the debate, Trump suggested that Khan "would be alive today," if he had been in the White House. "Unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq," Trump said, reiterating a false claim that he never supported the Iraq war. Trump did, in fact, express support for the war before, and 48 hours after, the invasion, although he began questioning it within a week. Trump's response caused Clinton's foreign policy spokesman Jesse Lehrich to erupt on Twitter. He wrote: "hey, @realDonaldTrump — regarding your claim that Captain Khan would be alive if you were president: Go f*** yourself." Lehrich apologized a short time later "for the clearly inappropriate nature and language of this personal tweet."

By Agamoni Ghosh October 10, 2016 11:24 BST The 2017 Chrysler Pacifica minivanMark Blinch/Reuters The first few prototypes believed to be from a fleet of Google's self-driving cars – the Chrysler Pacificas – were reportedly spotted in Mountain View California recently. The Pacifica 2017 is Chrysler's new plug-in hybrid minivan, chosen as one of the premier car models by Google to develop in its self-driving fleet in partnership with Fiat Chrysler. According to a 9 to 5 Google report, Alphabet is currently testing a fleet of nearly 100 Pacifica minivans with a new set of sensors to try out its self-driving system. The prototypes are the biggest addition to Google's existing self-driving fleet, which currently consists of 24 Lexus Rx450h SUVs and 34 prototypes of its own design. One of the key reasons Google chose the latest Pacifica model is that it offers a plug-in hybrid option equipped with a 16 kWh battery pack that allows an all-electric range for 30 miles. Apart from that the 2017 Pacifica boasts of more than 100 in-built features like a surround-view camera, adaptive cruise control, and forward-collision alert. The special fleet to be used by Google will most likely have more automated controls on board. While Google has been developing its fleet of self-driving cars for years now, it has not yet run public trials like Uber or reached anywhere close to Tesla's 222 million miles driven on autopilot in a year. Last month Google's fleet barely passed the two million miles mark. However, the company has maintained that it does not want to rush the launch of its self-driving cars unless it is fully sure about its safety and viability.

The collaboration aims to make Arabic books more accessible for first-time online book readers and book lovers alike with discounts of up to 90 per cent on online books at the Google Play Books store, which hosts more than 5,000,000 titles. Discounts are valid across nine countries in the Google Play Store (both in IOS and Android) for the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. This is the first such online book initiative, and the first discount of this scale in the region at the Google Play Store. For a four-week period, Google will run its highest-ever discount on the Play Books store on more than 4,000 popular fiction, non-fiction and children’s titles in an effort to reach millions of smartphone users in the Middle East and GCC. Shaikh Ahmad Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President of Dubai Civil Aviation and Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates airline and Group, said: “Our ‘Celebrating Arabic Reading’ initiative with Google aims to encourage more people to read, and try out Arabic e-books. Smartphones and tablets are increasingly a part of our daily lives, so it makes perfect sense to promote reading on these new platforms as well. People are hungry for content, especially Arabic digital content, and there isn’t a smarter investment for the future of this region than providing access to e-books to broaden the horizons of millions.” Ronan Harris, vice-president for Large Customer Sales for Google Europe Middle East and Africa, said: “Technology has always played a pivotal role in providing people with equal access to information, and empowering them with knowledge. That’s something we’re very passionate about at Google and it’s in line with our core mission here in Mena to help promote and preserve local Arabic content on the web whether it was on YouTube, Search, Maps or Play. Through our collaboration with Emirates, we hope we can make Arabic literature more accessible and enjoyable than ever. There is so much opportunity to build the digital ecosystem here and we’re happy to have partners like Emirates make it happen.” Emirates also commissioned the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature and the Emirates Literature Foundation to help identify and curate a collection of over 50 Arabic books in the Google Play Books store that will be discounted at 90 per cent off. This curated book collection encompasses a wide variety of best-selling fiction and nonfiction titles.

(Credit: Michael Short/Bloomberg) Google has finally unveiled its new flagship smartphones, the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL. But its product launch on October 4 created as many questions as it answered. By and large, Google’s announcement confirmed leaks that had circulated beforehand: we got two new phones, the 5-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch XL, and they have better screens, improved battery life and fast charging, and a best-in-class 12.3-megapixel rear camera. We also got Google Assistant, an AI assistant that’s an improved version of the previous Google bot, a built-in tab for users to talk to Google customer service, and unlimited, full-resolution storage in Google Photos. All of this came wrapped up in a device that looks a whole lot like an Apple iPhone. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 108.43 +0.64 +0.59% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% But until we actually get our hands on these phones, a lot of questions remain about how they will work, and and if any of these new features could have unexpected downsides. Here are five big questions that still remain on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL: 1. How will Google protect your privacy with Google Assistant? Google CEO Sundar Pichai spent as much time talking about Google’s new software as he did about hardware when he announced the new phones. One of the most notable new features in Pixel is Google Assistant, which is supposed to be more interactive than Google’s previous AI and integrate seamlessly with Google Home and other smart devices. The way that Google Assistant works is by tapping your questions into the billions of points in Google’s knowledge graph, and by learning your habits and preferences over time. The whole design encourages you to share as much as possible about yourself and your day to build your own, personal Google. Here’s Google’s video pitch for it: In the middle of the video, the voiceover says, “Naturally, anything you share with it is safe and secure.” But Google has yet to drill down into the specifics of how it will keep your data safe from prying eyes, and did not respond to an emailed request for comment on this issue. 2. How powerful are the speakers? Google claims the camera on Pixel is the best camera on any smartphone ever. But what about audio? Despite the trend toward stereo speakers in top-of-the-line phones–including Google’s own Nexus 6 and 6P devices–the Pixel phones come with just a single, bottom-firing speaker. Will this one speaker be good enough for the Pixel to hold its own against competitors like the iPhone 7? 3. When will we see Andromeda OS? One big rumor swirling around before Google’s press event was that we might finally get the word on Andromeda OS, which is speculated to be a hybrid of the Chrome and Android operating systems. It looks like we’re not getting this on the Pixel phones, which will ship with Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box. But could we see Andromeda rolled out as an update within the next year? 4. Why will all Google apps have round icons in the Pixel Launcher? Let’s face it: the Pixel and Pixel XL sure look a lot like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Instead of sticking with a more typical Android look like we see in Motorola and Samsung phones, Google went for the sleek, camera-bump free aluminum body in classic Apple style. While Apple has been known for its perfectionism and tight control over its operating systems, Google’s Android ecosystem has historically been more open. Google has even run ads promoting how different its partners can be: Once upon a time, Google’s icons came in all shapes and size. Now, with the Pixel Launcher, they look more and more alike. It’s unclear why Google made this choice, but it does appear to be echoing Apple in software as well as hardware by pushing for greater design uniformity. 5. Is the Pixel Imprint and back glass a step forward or a gimmick? The Google Pixel comes with a fresh take on the fingerprint sensor on the back–dubbed Pixel Imprint. Now, the circular imprint for your fingertip on the back is surrounded by glass on the upper half of the phone. In addition to unlocking your phone using Imprint you can also swipe down with your fingertip to immediately pull up notifications. While the Imprint is one small step forward in Google’s fingerprint reader, the back glass around it is mystery. While I suspect Google was going for elegance, overall it seems like a strained move to separate Pixel from the Apple iPhone.

The initiative is to make Arabic books more accessible for first-time online book readers and book lovers alike with unprecedented discounts of up to 90 percent off on online books at the Google Play Books store. Discounts are valid across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and Chairman of Emirates Group, said, "Our ‘Celebrating Arabic Reading’ initiative with Google aims to encourage more people to read, and try out Arabic e-books. Smartphones and tablets are increasingly a part of our daily lives, so it makes perfect sense to promote reading on these new platforms as well. People are hungry for content, especially Arabic digital content, and there isn’t a smarter investment for the future of this region than providing access to e-books to broaden the horizons of millions." Ronan Harris, Vice President for Large Customer Sales for Google Europe Middle East and Africa, said: "Through our collaboration with Emirates, we hope we can make Arabic literature more accessible and enjoyable than ever. There is so much opportunity to build the digital ecosystem here and we’re happy to have partners like Emirates make it happen."

Mercury News  •  Monday October 10, 2016 4:35 AM View Slideshow Request to buy this photo Google Google’s Allo chat app will provide suggestions from Google Assistant, whether for restaurants (on the left phone) or conversation replies (on the right). If you’re looking for a quick way to fire off a message to a friend or family member from your phone or computer, you have a bewildering array of choices. Now Google has added one more. In September, the search giant launched Allo. The new app, which is available for Android smartphones and iPhones, is intended to be Google’s answer to the WhatsApps and WeChats of the world — an easy-to-use messaging program for consumers. But Google has added a tweak to Allo that helps it stand out from the pack, both for good and ill. The company has incorporated into Allo Google Assistant, its Siri-like technology that it previously called Google Now. At its best, Assistant can save you time and provide you helpful information when you need it. But its performance is uneven, and from a privacy standpoint, it’s a disaster. After testing Allo this past week, I came away thinking both the app and Assistant need more time to bake. Allo works like many other contemporary messaging apps. You don’t need to sign up for an account or create a login ID. You can link it to your Google account, but you don’t have to. Instead, Allo identifies you based on your phone number. In order to send a message to another person on Allo, you just need to know their phone number. The app can be linked to your address book so that you can easily find people to connect with. You can use Allo to send messages both to people who are already using the app and to those who aren’t; the app sends messages to the latter group via the SMS text system for free. You can also create group chats where you can send out messages to multiple people at the same time. Allo provides buttons that allow you to easily send photos and videos and to share your current location. It also offers a limited collection of stickers you can send. Weirdly, one of the default sticker themes includes a cartoon sloth doing a variety of different things such as hugging a wine bottle or surfing on a pizza. I found it relatively easy to sign up for Allo and start sending messages, but not any more so than other contemporary chat apps such as WhatsApp or Tango. Instead, Allo tries to make its mark with Assistant. Users can query Google Assistant for information by sending messages to it directly. In this way, it works a lot like Siri, only you type instead of speak. You can ask it about today’s weather or a recent sports score or have it translate some text. I found this function only somewhat useful. At least on my iPhone, it was easier to simply call up Siri, rather than having to type something into Allo. And Siri, interestingly enough, often had better answers. Siri knew when the Warriors play their first regular season game, for example. When I asked the same question of Assistant, it directed me to a webpage. But you can also encounter Assistant within the context of your conversations with other Allo users. It will, unprompted, suggest text responses or provide what it thinks is relevant information. The suggested text responses work somewhat like the autocorrect feature in Apple’s Messages app, but Assistant will offer them before you type anything, display them in line with the other messages in your conversation and won’t actually send them unless you tap on them. I found these suggestions mildly helpful at best. Sometimes they saved me a bit of typing. But the suggested responses could also be annoying, because they weren’t necessarily things I would normally say. When my wife replied “no” to a question I’d asked her, Assistant suggested I respond with “Bummer,” a word I rarely use. The other thing Assistant offers is potentially helpful information in the context of a conversation. If you ask a friend if she wants to go to dinner tonight, Assistant might ask you if you want to see a list of nearby restaurants. Or if you suggest going to a movie, it might ask if you want to see the latest listings. As with the suggested text responses, you can respond to Assistant’s offers of help by either ignoring them or tapping on one of the options it offers. Again, the helpfulness of these suggestions varied. The movie listings helpfully highlighted the latest releases. But it wasn’t clear, when I asked for a list of nearby restaurants, why it choose the seven it highlighted, none of which were interesting to me. Unfortunately, there’s no way to turn Assistant off, at least in your regular Allo chats. And even when its suggestions are helpful, Assistant’s capabilities are limited. It can’t purchase tickets for you or make reservations. And you can’t turn to another bot or third-party app, because Allo doesn’t yet support them. Instead, Allo will send you out of your conversation and over to a web browser. Assistant also has a big downside from a privacy perspective. To improve its responses, Google by default has set Allo to monitor everything you are saying and keep a record of your conversations indefinitely, unless you delete them. That’s in sharp contrast to Apple’s Messages app and WhatsApp, both of which encrypt users messages by default. You can turn on an “incognito” mode in Allo that will scramble individual conversations, but it can be hard to find and it blocks access to Assistant. Allo has other shortcomings. Unlike Hangouts, Google’s other messaging app, or Apple’s Messages, Allo right now is only available for Apple and Android smartphones. You can’t use it to chat with people on Windows or Mac computers or even people on iPads or other tablets. Unlike Skype or Tango or many other messaging apps, Allo doesn’t offer video calling. Google recently launched a separate video calling app called Duo, but there are no links between the two. And Allo doesn’t yet support any of the fun messaging features like those Apple recently added to Messages. So you can’t send an invisible message or fireworks in the background of your conversation. While interesting from a technology standpoint, Assistant doesn’t make up for those shortcomings. With so many other well-developed messaging options available, it’s hard to argue that you should switch to Allo. Troy Wolverton is a technology columnist for The Mercury News.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Valley Talk Elizabeth Holmes’s Surrender, Snapchat’s I.P.O., and Why Twitter Could Be Doomed Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Valley Talk Elizabeth Holmes’s Surrender, Snapchat’s I.P.O., and Why Twitter Could Be Doomed The Hive’s technology correspondents reflect on a wild week in the Valley. by Nick Bilton, Maya KosoffOctober 10, 2016 5:00 am Email Facebook Twitter By Richard Drew/AP/Rex/Shutterstock. Maya Kosoff: Welcome back to another segment of Valley Talk! There’s much to discuss, so let’s just start with the elephant in the room (or the small silhouette of a blue bird, as it were). Twitter is suddenly up for sale, but what’s not immediately clear is who is really buying. Disney makes sense if you think about Bob Iger and Jack Dorsey’s friendship and Dorsey’s seat on Disney’s board, and the potential for Disney to use Twitter as a new video distribution platform. Google and Apple pretty clearly want nothing to do with it. Marc Benioff seems either wildly enthusiastic or noncommittal and cautious about the prospect of acquiring Twitter for its data, depending on the day. Every time another report comes out that a company wants to buy Twitter, its stock dips, so while Twitter shareholders might be jazzed about the idea of Twitter selling itself, others aren’t keen on anyone actually buying it. Help me understand this, Nick: Why is Twitter trying to sell itself now, and what’s the best-case scenario for Twitter here? Nick Bilton: Poor Twitter. The last two weeks for the company (and all the employees) must have been pretty traumatic. First it wasn’t for sale. Then it was. Salesforce wanted to buy it. Then Disney, Google, and who knows who else wanted it. Then they didn’t. The company’s stock chart looks like a level of Super Mario Bros. right now with all the ups and down. Where do all these rumors stand now? I honestly have no idea. All that is clear is that it does seem that the board is finally ready to go to Plan B (a sale). The question is, does anyone want to buy it? I truly do believe that one of the reasons the company’s future is so unclear is because Twitter is too nasty, or in some instances, too dangerous—as is evident from the ISIS accounts the company has been trying to evict. I feel like if you ban all the people on Twitter who say mean and negative things, you’d probably only have a few bots left on the service tweeting porn at each other. The best-case scenario for Twitter, in my opinion, is that . . . drumroll . . . Facebook buys it. I know, I know. But hear me out: Zuckerberg and his team know social better than anyone on the planet and they can take all their learning from Facebook and Instagram and apply it to Twitter. (Facebook has teams that focus on adding empathy to the platform, which could change Twitter drastically.) It would benefit Facebook, too, as they still haven’t captured the live discussions in the same way that Twitter has. The problem is, Facebook’s philosophy on privacy and data collection has often been drastically different to Twitter’s over the years, and I’m not sure the cultures would mesh very well. Maya: Twitter selling to Facebook would also, of course, mean Jack Dorsey can set aside his ego and be okay with having Mark Zuckerberg lord over it. To your point about how Twitter has the capacity to be a cesspool for ISIS accounts, someone in tech recently told me they think harassment and hate are to Twitter as porn is to Tumblr—in other words, actually eradicating all the hateful, abusive Twitter accounts would hurt Twitter’s bottom line too much. And, this line of thinking goes, since Twitter has had such a hard time onboarding new users and keeping their M.A.U. numbers up quarter-over-quarter, they aren’t willing to do anything about abusive accounts, which would explain why so many accounts that have demonstrably harassed others are still allowed to exist on Twitter, even after they’ve been reported. Nick: Well, that’s the reason why I don’t think Twitter would end up selling to Facebook: egos. Right now, Zuckerberg and Dorsey are counterparts (putting aside the little point that Facebook has about 1.2 billion more people on its platform than Twitter). It would be difficult for Dorsey to go and work under Zuckerberg and alongside Kevin Systrom. And you’re completely correct about the trolls and Twitter. I think if the company banned everyone who was mean on the platform, their numbers would vanish, the stock would fall even more, there’d be cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria! I mean this sincerely, but it’s really sad what happened to the service. I barely ever use it anymore, and precisely because—to quote Louis C.K. when he quit Twitter —it just doesn’t make me feel good. It’s perfect for the election cycle because we are all supposed to be jerks, but I think, at the end of the day, that the grand experiment of everyone in the world having the opportunity to converse in the same chat room didn’t work out so well. Maya: Speaking of grand experiments, let’s talk about Theranos for a minute. This week Elizabeth Holmes basically announced a pivot for the company that will take it out of the blood-testing arena, laying off 340 employees, or about 40 percent of the company’s workforce. It’s more or less an admission of failure a year after John Carreyrou’s reporting in the Wall Street Journal showed how ineffective the company was at doing the one thing it claimed to be able to do. Theranos is probably going to start doing a lot of research and development so maybe, maybe the company can make its new miniLab diagnostic tool work. What are the odds that Holmes and the company actually produce something successful now? It seems to me like this is just a way for the company to kind of quietly fade into obscurity. Nick: “Fuck. You. Carrey-rou!” (Sorry, I couldn’t stop myself.) I do have to say, I’m not surprised by the latest move by Holmes, but at the same time, I am. She seemed unmoved by the tumult of bad press, the inquiries from government agencies, the lawsuits, and the hammering of stories by Carreyrou. I was convinced that she wouldn’t give up—ever. But it seems she had no choice. I really do feel terrible for the 340 employees who lost their jobs this week. I can’t imagine how difficult that must be. What happens next to the company is actually more predictable than what happens next to Twitter. I think Theranos will eventually change its name (how could they not?) and the company will continue its pivot away from the pinprick blood testing. Then there is the unknown: does Holmes stay as the C.E.O.? What happens to the lawsuits? If the company does change its name, will they re-paint the company’s headquarters from green and mustard yellow to something more monotone? Maybe it’s time for us to pivot this conversation... what do you think of the impending Snapchat IPO? Maya: I love the boldness of a fast-growing, immature company like Snapchat going public. Who knows how much of this company is actually the work of Evan Spiegel (more realistically it’s probably a mix of the incredibly bright product and finance people they’ve staffed up with over the past 18 months or so), but Snapchat is doing so many weird things and it’s raised so much capital that it doesn’t seem to care whether they end up working. The company bought Bitstrips, the Canadian start-up that makes Bitmoji, earlier this year, and now it’s doing something totally different—basically pivoting to become a camera company instead of being just a messaging platform—by launching hardware in the form of Spectacles. I don’t know if Wall Street will be as bullish on Snapchat as literally everyone under the age of 35 seems to be, or if Snapchat’s cool factor will ever dissipate, but a Snap I.P.O., if it really ends up being in the $25 billion range, would signal some good news for the otherwise-sluggish tech I.P.O. pipeline. Nick: Someone once told me that Evan Spiegel considers Snapchat a “toy” that kids play with. I thought that was so refreshing, because most of the people in Silicon Valley talk about their app as if they’re curing cancer. And here’s this company that’s worth $25 billion, and the C.E.O. doesn’t take himself too seriously, he just looks at his company as a toy. That’s probably why people under 35 love it so much, and why it keeps innovating as it has. But you’re right. It’s completely unclear if Wall Street will embrace it, or choose not to invest. They have Twitter as the harbinger of what can go wrong, and Facebook as an augury of what can go right, financially. Knowing a lot of people who work at Snapchat, I think the company is going to be just fine. Also, hat tip to Spiegel for turning down Zuckerberg’s $3 billion offer a couple of years ago.

The search giant has been producing its own Android-based phones for the last few years under the "Nexus" brand - but no more. Google has ditched the name Nexus in favour of the Pixel moniker. In the past, the company has used the Pixel name on its premium tablet and laptop products.

Alternatively, you can go to the network EE, which has an exclusive right to the Pixel phone in the UK. With EE, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month, 24 month 4GEE plan, which comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers.

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach The Pixel XL is also available free on a £55.99 a month, 24 month plan, and comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers. 4GEE Plan customers receive unlimited minutes, texts and 500MB of data a month for use abroad in the EU. Alternatively, for just £5 per month more, you can get Pixel and Pixel XL on 4GEE Max plans giving you access to the UK’s fastest 4G speeds, and inclusive access to the BT Sport App for the duration of the plan. Just as an extra sweetener, those who pre-order before October 20th will receive a £50 Google Play voucher they can use to purchase content from the Google Play store. Design The white Pixel bears a striking resemblance to the iPhone 6 although it has the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner popular with other Android handsets. This is #Pixel.

There will be a choice of either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and Google is also offering Pixel owners free unlimited storage for photos and videos through its Google Photos app. And - of course - Google has kept the 3.5mm headphone jack in place, unlike Apple which ditched it with the launch of the iPhone 7. Read More What makes phone batteries explode? And what to do if YOU bought Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Both the Pixel and the XL have a similar design to last year's well-received Nexus 6P albeit with a thinner bezel that means a near edge-to-edge display. Price Buying directly from Google or Carphone Warehouse means you can pick up the phones SIM-free and unlocked for the one-off price of £599 for the 5-inch Pixel and £719 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. That puts them in exactly the same kind of territory as Apple’s iPhone models. It looks like EE is the only network in the UK that will stock the phone on contract, and we'll update this as soon as we know for certain.

The search giant has been producing its own Android-based phones for the last few years under the "Nexus" brand - but no more. Google has ditched the name Nexus in favour of the Pixel moniker. In the past, the company has used the Pixel name on its premium tablet and laptop products.

Alternatively, you can go to the network EE, which has an exclusive right to the Pixel phone in the UK. With EE, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month, 24 month 4GEE plan, which comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers.

Alternatively, for just £5 per month more, you can get Pixel and Pixel XL on 4GEE Max plans giving you access to the UK’s fastest 4G speeds, and inclusive access to the BT Sport App for the duration of the plan.

There will be a choice of either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and Google is also offering Pixel owners free unlimited storage for photos and videos through its Google Photos app. And - of course - Google has kept the 3.5mm headphone jack in place, unlike Apple which ditched it with the launch of the iPhone 7. Read More What makes phone batteries explode? And what to do if YOU bought Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Both the Pixel and the XL have a similar design to last year's well-received Nexus 6P albeit with a thinner bezel that means a near edge-to-edge display. Price Buying directly from Google or Carphone Warehouse means you can pick up the phones SIM-free and unlocked for the one-off price of £599 for the 5-inch Pixel and £719 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. That puts them in exactly the same kind of territory as Apple’s iPhone models.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Google in ageist hot water Posted on October 10, 2016 by Nick Farrell - News A US judge has ruled that other software engineers over age 40 who were interviewed by Google but didn’t get hired can step forward and join the lawsuit. Two job applicants, both over the age of 40, were interviewed by Google but weren’t offered jobs. The judge turning the suit into a “collective action” means that people who “interviewed in person with Google for a software engineer, site reliability engineer, or systems engineer position when they were 40 years old or older, and received notice on or after August 28, 2014, that they were refused employment, will have an opportunity to join in. Google says it’s fighting the suit. A spokesperson told Rueters, “We believe the allegations here are without merit and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We have strong policies against discrimination on any unlawful basis, including age.” However the  judge has warned that Google’s defence of having anti-agist “policies” is not going to cut it: “Having such a policy does not necessarily shield a company from a discrimination suit, particularly in light of the evidence and allegations presented here … today, most, if not all, companies are well versed in anti-discrimination and make great efforts to ensure their written policies comply with anti-discrimination law.” One of the plaintiffs alleged that a Google recruiter told her she needed to puts the dates of her graduation on her resume so interviewers could determine her age. That same plaintiff argued that she had found seven others who say they had similar experiences at Google. She also presented evidence to the court that the median age of Google’s workforce is 29 while the median age in the US for programmers is 42.8 years old. Google has previous form for agism. It was sued in 2004 for age discrimination and, after winding through the appeals system, the case was ultimately settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.   Tags: age, agism, Google Search for: Recent Articles AT&T's purchase of Time Warner in trouble It is starting to look like AT&T's purchase of Time Warner could fall foul of the White House [s[...] String theory might be about to finally be killed off The world's top boffins are debating finally killing off one of the more elegant scientific theories[...] Facebook denies it is responsible for Trump Mark Zuckerberg has rubbished the notion that fake news on Facebook helped Donald "Prince of Orange"[...] There's more browsing on mobiles than PCs Internet usage by mobile and tablet exceeded desktop worldwide for the first time in October accordi[...] German telco wants “debate” on privacy Telefonica Deutschland's O2Dn.DE chief executive called for a debate about data privacy in Germany.

Pichai’s Google is starting to show its new shine. By James Francis. Added by James Francis on 10 October 2016. Saved under James Francis, Opinion, Top Tags: Apple, Facebook, Google, James Francis, Microsoft, Sundar Pichai Tweet Would I buy Google Home? I’m not sure. Then again, I’m not the target audience, since I’m not interested in Amazon’s Echo either. I like shouting commands at technology: I frequently use Siri to launch mundane tasks like start a timer or call someone. Yet it’s not a reliable experience, often snagged somewhere between a slow data connection and Siri getting confused by my utterances (some reports indicate that Echo and Home still have similar drawbacks). Reliability matters in tech: ponder that next time your car refuses to start. Nonetheless, Google believes this is the future. I agree, but I don’t think that future is about to arrive. That said, Google may be playing the long game here, launching hardware just to make sure it has a seat at the table. I’m getting ahead of myself. If you missed the Google announcements this past week, the company is now quite firmly an “ecosystem” or end-to-end consumer player. What do I mean? Well, you can buy a Google phone, log it onto the wireless of your Google router, then send instructions to stream a movie through your Google Chromecast dongle plugged into your TV, or bark at the digital assistant hidden inside the Google Home speaker to do the same. That assistant is the same one you’d talk to on your Google Pixel phone. This is accomplished by connecting to Google’s powerful networks of computers and artificial intelligence software. Step aside, Apple It feels a little like MomCorp in Futurama, a parody most often associated with Apple. Yet Apple is trailing here. It may still have a Mont Blanc-level of style appeal, but is about to be sidelined in the mainstream. Not for a lack of hardware: Apple has a very decent home/lifestyle beachhead in the iPhone, Apple TV, Airport and more, all surrounded by a nice walled garden that makes it easier to stay than leave. Google, Amazon and Facebook certainly envy that. But Apple has comparably little cred in behavioural data, the currency of the modern age. Google and Facebook not only make fortunes from data insight on how the world acts, but those stockpiles of bits are being channelled toward serious AI efforts. When Google CEO Sundar Pichai opened the event, he pretty much only spoke about the powerful digital assistants that will personalise all our experiences. Distributed computing has allowed machine learning (think of it as a single-task-orientated AI) to explode in use and mature rapidly. High-speed connectivity allows them to reach to other devices. When I tell Siri I need 10 minutes, I’m really talking to an online machine that teaches itself to understand me better. But it goes further than that: machine learning essentially automates complex software tasks. Given enough time, any software task. Doing your accounts in a spreadsheet? One day the spreadsheet will do it all for you. Google’s new Pixel smartphone To borrow another cartoon reference, it’s the robot built by the mad scientist in Rick & Morty, with the sole purpose of passing the butter. Getting back to Google – its new Pixel phones have a burst photo mode where AI selects the best shot for you (and seems quite good at it). The iPhone 7 also employs its own bag of photo-related AI tricks. Use cases are plentiful and growing fast both behind and in front of the scenes. Welcome your new robot overlords, yada yada. Building a data garden To make much of that work, you need data. To get data, you need devices that people (you) and things (your home) use. This is Google’s strategy, one that was all but official until now. The big G has laced its shoes, combed its hair, shipped the unruly moonshot projects of Google X to live with the new parent company Alphabet, and set about being a serious company with serious hardware products and services. Pichai is certainly displaying solid leadership. These products do not look bad. I like the mesh routers and what appears to be ample scope for applications on them. The Chromecast Ultra seems dull, but I’m a 4K cynic. The new Pixel phones truly do up the game, though distribution is still anaemic. If the Amazon Echo gets you excited, I can’t see why Google Home wouldn’t. (The new Daydream virtual reality system also looks interesting, but that’s an entirely different topic and the outlier of the event.) All of these help create the smart home/lifestyle garden Google wants to roll out around every willing consumer, including the exchange of data. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Google’s announcements have drawn a wide range of reactions, from gushing acolytes to outright denouncements. If I owned Google shares, I’d be comfortable with what I saw. This is a leaner, more focused Google ready to rumble Apple, Facebook, Amazon and anyone else found sniffing at its fence line — but with the intent of moving that fence aggressively. Still, it has a few things that will need addressing. Search results in many markets remain lacklustre and Google needs to help outlets improve their visibility if it wants the quality results that will make us reliant on its AI services. It also needs to demonstrate that its frequent habit of losing interest in projects is toned back. Finally — and most crucially — Google stinks at customer support. Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and especially Amazon are all far better at it. I’m not building my lifestyle around a company that isn’t known for listening to its supporters. The support feature on the Pixel phones shows it is aware of this. But Google will need to do a lot more if it wants to sit in the centre of our homes. That said, I’m bullish. Pichai’s Google is starting to show its new shine.

Google Pixel: Which One Should You Buy? Mobile 32 0 0 October 10, 2016 iPhone 7 Vs. Google Pixel: Which One Should You Buy? Samir Makwana Google announced the highly anticipated new Pixel phones at an event in San Francisco, California, earlier this month. The company has announced two Pixel models in its new line – Pixel and Pixel XL. Both new Pixel phones carry the words such as “Made by Google” and “Phone by Google” branding to show Google’s deeper involvement. Before we address the Google Pixel vs. Apple iPhone 7 comparison, let’s take a quick look at the new Pixel phones. With the Pixel phones, Google moves to the premium price tag and Google-optimized experience packed Android phones. The long-running Google Nexus line of products will now be replaced and rebranded under the Pixel banner. Google partnered with phone makers to deliver the best Android experience in the Nexus line. Now the company is stepping up to make the phones by itself. To transform the designs and concepts into a real phone, Google chose to partner with HTC, the first Nexus phone hardware maker. “We’ve now decided to take the next step and provide our take on the best Google experience, by bringing hardware and software design together under one roof.” Let’s take a look at the specs sheet of the Pixel and the iPhone 7. Apple iPhone 7 vs Google Pixel comparison [Image by Samir Makwana] Design Though Google may beat its chest about designing the Pixel to be different, its similarity with the iPhone’s design language is quite evident. The Pixel phones are not waterproof or dustproof, and it has a glass window at the back to give a break from the anodized aluminum. On the other hand, Apple’s iPhone 7 bears a close resemblance to the iPhone 6s. Apple has added the IP67 rating to make it waterproof to a certain extent. Also, the oleophobic coating on the Retina display prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet. On the other hand, Google doesn’t offer either of these in the Pixel phones. Every year, Apple uses a stronger aluminum alloy to construct the iPhones, and we can only hope that the latest model follows the same. On the other hand, the Nexus 6P did suffer a bendgate last year, and Google is yet to share details on the aluminum alloy that makes the Pixel’s chassis. Google adopts a USB Type-C port at the bottom in the Pixel and continues to offer the standard audio port. Meanwhile, Apple has yanked out the audio port and pushing the Lightning port for connecting headphones and other accessories. Apple added the matte black and Jet Black in the color options. While Google offers Pixel in Quite Silver, Very Black, and Really Blue color options. Display Apple uses a 4.7-inch LED-backlit display with IPS panel technology and a new Taptic engine. Apple calls it a Retina HD display because of the 1334 x 750-pixel resolution which translates to 329PPI pixel density. The screen offers a DCI-P3 Wide Color standard which covers the most natural range of colors often used in digital movie projections in the U.S. This year, Apple has gotten brighter with up to 600 nits of brightness. The display also has a layer of oleophobic coating to ward of fingerprint and smudges as much as possible. In a nutshell, the iPhone 7 has the best iPhone screen ever. The Pixel by Google offers a 5-inch AMOLED display with 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass 4 layer. Sporting a 1080 x 1920-pixel resolution, the Pixel provides a crisp 441PPI pixel density. The AMOLED displays are known to produce greater color gamuts and high refresh rates. However, the demerit of these display panels is that the colors can fade a bit over a period or even burn (not literally) if used at high brightness for a long time. Then again, the AMOLED displays consume less power. Software Experience While Apple trumpets about the 3D Touch and improved Siri with services integration, there’s hardly anything novel. The iOS 10 version continues to bother the current iPhone users with a few nagging bugs. That said, the iOS provides a smoother experience on iPhone, most of the time. The Google Pixel [Image by Google] Google has added the Artificial Intelligence powered Google Assistant in the phone along with the Allo app for messaging and Duo for video calling. Google has integrated the Now on Tap feature that takes a snapshot of the information on the screen and offers the best relevant search solutions. This feature can not only converse with you, but can also make bookings such as movie tickets or restaurant reservations on your behalf. Google’s Artificial Intelligence-packed Android 7.0 Nougat experience is indeed tempting. Camera According to Recode, Google has not only worked on the software side of things, but also selected the image sensor and worked on the lens part for Pixel phones. DxOMark rates the Google Pixel highly for having one of the best cameras in mobile available today. The Pixel’s camera is capable of capturing high-quality details and keep the noise minimal in the images. On the other hand, Apple’s iPhone is one of the most popular mobile phone cameras around. The 12-megapixel iSight camera with f/1.8 aperture can shoot 4K videos, provide better quality zoom, and fares well even in low-light environments. DPreview states that Optical Image Stabilization will give it an edge over the other smartphone cameras for low-light photography. Regarding camera app simplicity and capturing speed, the iPhone 7’s camera can clearly outweigh other smartphones. Battery Apple iPhone 7 has a 1,960mAh battery inside and theoretically promises more run time than the iPhone 6. However, the early reviews of the iPhone 7 have a different story to tell. Apple promises 14 hours of talk time over 3G network, standby for ten days, 13 hours of wireless video playback and 40 hours of audio playback. The Inquisitr reported that the initial impressions of the iPhone 7 indicate sub-par battery life. Meanwhile, Google Pixel houses a 2,770mAh battery, which in comparison looks more than the one in iPhone 7, regarding capacity. The Pixel promises up to 26 hours of talk time over 3G network, up to 19 days standby time, 13 hours of video playback, and 110 hours of wired audio playback. The Google Pixel offers a better battery life than the iPhone 7, at least on paper for now. Pricey Affair Apple iPhone 7 [Image by Apple Inc.] Apple sells the iPhone 7 starting at $649 for a 32GB model, and Google Pixel’s 32GB model sells for the same $649 price. Even the 128GB models of the iPhone 7 and Pixel cost the same at $749. Both phones compete head-to-head and offer no discounts if you buy it directly from the respective companies. However, Verizon is offering up to $300 off on exchange of a working old phone under the trade-in program. Then again, Verizon’s Google Pixel will have a locked bootloader. So if you plan to tinker around with the Pixel, buy it directly from Google. Google Pixel phones set a new path for the company entering into the phone making business. Apple, on the other hand, has high hopes with its new iPhone 7 models. Especially, since the iPhone sales slumped in the last quarter, according to The Wall Street Journal. At the end of the day, it comes down to choosing between two different ecosystems. You can buy the iPhone 7 for some waterproof protection, great camera, 3D Touch, and a battery that barely lasts a day. Or you can choose Pixel for the Google-optimized Android experience, competitive camera performance, twice the RAM than the iPhone 7, and a battery that can last more than a day. One of the key differences is that the iPhone 7 is water-resistant but the Pixel isn’t. Both companies certainly need their phones to win the battle. Since you have read enough arguments about both devices here, which phone would you buy?

Click here to enlarge image Editor’s choice Seeking a choice of voices in technology By Quentin Hardy / New York Times News Service Published Oct 10, 2016 at 12:02AM Jason Mars is an African-American professor of computer science who also runs a tech startup. When his company’s artificially intelligent smartphone app talks, he said, it sounds “like a helpful, young Caucasian female.” “There’s a kind of pressure to conform to the prejudices of the world” when you are trying to make a consumer hit, he said. “It would be interesting to have a black guy talk, but we don’t want to create friction, either. First we need to sell products.” Mars’ startup is part of a growing high-tech field called conversational computing. This technology is being popularized by programs like the Siri system in Apple’s iPhone, and Alexa, which is built into the Echo, Amazon’s artificially intelligent home computing device. Conversational computing is holding a mirror to many of society’s biggest preconceptions around race and gender. Listening and talking are the new input and output devices of computers. But they have social and emotional dimensions never seen with keyboards and screens. Do we, for example, associate the stereotypical voice of an English butler — think of Jarvis the computer in “Iron Man” — with a helpful and intelligent person? And why do so many people want to hear a voice that sounds like it came from a younger woman with no discernible accent? Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other. Where commerce is concerned, that creates a problem: Is it better to succeed by complying with a stereotype, or risk failure in the market by going against type? For many, the answer is initially clear. Microsoft’s artificially intelligent voice system is Cortana, for example, and it was originally the voice of a female character in the video game “Halo.” “In our research for Cortana, both men and women prefer a woman, younger, for their personal assistant, by a country mile,” said Derek Connell, senior vice president for search at Microsoft. In other words, a secretary — a job that is traditionally seen as female. Last week, Google introduced a number of voice-based products, including Google Home, its version of Echo. All of them use Google Assistant, which also speaks in tones associated with a young, educated woman. Google Assistant “is a millennial librarian who understands cultural cues, and can wink at things,” said Ryan Germick, who leads the personality efforts in building Google Assistant. “Products aren’t about rational design decisions. They are about psychology and how people feel.” The company has had internal debates about whether to respond differently on questions to the computer about suicide, Connell said. “We’ve leaned to providing information about suicide prevention everywhere,” he said, as opposed to offering no advice at all. But sometimes, if you want people to figure out quickly that they are talking to a machine, it can be better to have a man’s voice. For example, IBM’s Watson, when it talks to Bob Dylan in television commercials, has a male voice. When Ashok Goel, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, adapted Watson to have a female voice as an informal experiment in how people relate to conversational machines, his students couldn’t tell it was a computer. But Watson’s maleness is the exception. Amazon’s AI technology is another in the comforting female voice camp. “Alexa was always an assistant, and female,” said Peng Shao, who worked at Amazon on the Echo and is now at a Seattle startup, building another speech-based AI system. Amazon would not comment on its product. Gender is just the starting point. Can your AI technology understand accents? And can it respond in a way that feels less robotic and at least mimics some sort of human empathy? “You need a persona,” Shao said. “It’s a very emotional thing — people would get red, even get violent, if it didn’t understand them. When it did understand them, it felt like magic. They sleep next to them. This is heading for hospitals, senior care, a lot of sensitive places.” Capital One developed a banking app on Alexa and found it had to dial down the computer’s formality to make people comfortable talking about their finances with a computer. “Money is inextricably linked to emotion, enabling and preventing things in your life,” said Stephanie Hay, the head of content strategy, culture and AI design at Capital One. At first the app said, “Hello,” but that seemed too tense. “‘Hi, there’ worked better,” she said. “She’s my friend, hanging out with me in the kitchen. I need her to be reliable and approachable, but not invasive.” We don’t just need that computerized voice to meet our expectations, said Justine Cassell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. We need computers to relate to us and put us at ease when performing a task. “We have to know that the other is enough like us that it will run our program correctly,” she said. That need seems to start young. Cassell has designed an avatar of indeterminate race and gender for 5-year-olds. “The girls think it’s a girl, and the boys think it’s a boy,” she said. “Children of color think it’s of color; Caucasians think it’s Caucasian.” Another system she built spoke in what she termed “vernacular” to African-American children, achieving better results in teaching scientific concepts than when the computer spoke in standard English. When tutoring the children in a class presentation, however, “we wanted it to practice with them in ‘proper English.’ Standard American English is still the code of power, so we needed to develop an agent that would train them in code switching,” she said. Mars’ company, called Clinc, makes personal financial smartphone software that answers questions like “how much can I spend on a computer?” It relies on a similar Google-created female voice. He is hoping for enough success that he can eventually test and counter stereotypes with unexpected AI voices. “You need to be at a certain size before you can address these questions,” said Mars, who teaches at the University of Michigan. But maybe not too big. “I think consumers will eventually be open to exploring different voices and types,” he said. “Companies, they’ll probably stay conservative about it.” 15289503 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Print   Email   Font Resize How can I remove redirection malware from my PC? By Jack Shofield, The Guardian Updated:   03/16/2014 08:30:08 AM MDT There is plenty of free software that will locate and remove malware hiding in Windows. (Dominic Lipinski) I use the Firefox web browser with Adblock, and I run AVG anti-virus. Frequently, but not always, when I click on a link in a Google search result, it takes me to a page advertising something instead of going to the page indicated. If I go back to the search results and click the same link, it usually goes to the correct site. I thought this might be malware, but I have scanned with AVG and Malwarebytes, including anti-rootkit, and there is no indication of anything wrong. Researching the problem, I came across concerns that the Chrome browser could have this behaviour, and the suggestion was to disable extensions. I'm not very happy to do this because my various Firefox extensions add functionality I value. Geoff Google's Chrome browser has been having problems with something known as the chrome-navigation-error.info redirect, which may be botnet related. This also seems to afflict Apple Mac OS X users and apparently some Linux users, but not Firefox users. Either way, it's not your problem. Usually, the best way to tackle malware is to identify it, so that you can search for specific solutions. In this case, you're not sure if your PC has any malware, and you haven't identified it, so we will have to take a generic approach. This isn't a bad thing. The danger is that an attacker can use a small security hole to install more malignant software, so it's best to give your PC a thorough inspection. Advertisement Before you start, make sure you have all your programs and data backed up, and that you can restore Windows to its factory condition if necessary. Your PC probably has a hidden recovery partition that will do this. It's also a good idea to make a restore copy of Windows on DVD as well. Your PC may well prompt you to do this each time you restart it. Unfortunately, there are several ways of redirecting search traffic, so we can't even be certain that Firefox is the problem. It could be something to do with your Hosts file (though it probably isn't), with a rootkit on your hard drive, or with a “poisoned” domain name service (DNS). Some redirections are the result of websites being hacked, and in these cases, there's nothing wrong with the user's PC.Preparations Start by making a list of your useful Firefox extensions and then uninstalling and re-installing Firefox. Make sure you download the new version from https://www.mozilla.org/ (note the https for security). This link takes you to a page where you can download all the localised versions from Acholi to Xhosa, including “English (British)”. Don't use Google to search for this kind of thing: it is targeted by scammers and it is far too easy to be duped by the adverts that Google puts above search results. As when searching for visa, health card and similar application forms, use the DuckDuckGo search engine, which doesn't track you and also protects your privacy. Does your new, guaranteed-legitimate version of Firefox still have a redirection problem? If not, you can start to install the extensions you need. You could start with Adblock Edge – a forked version of Adblock Plus – and then install one extension per day. Don't install a new extension until you're sure the last one is OK. Next, replace your Hosts file, since one of its purposes is to redirect websites. I recommend the MVPS Hosts file created by a group of Microsoft-designated Most Valuable Professionals (they're not employees). This also works on non-Windows systems. Follow the instructions to install it, bearing in mind that you must have Administrator access. Finally, in this section, download Farbar's MiniToolBox from Bleeping Computer. This can detect and fix problems with proxy settings and search redirects, hijacked routers and so on. You don't need to install MiniToolBox, it just runs. In this case, tick the boxes for Flush DNS, Reset IE Proxy Settings, and Reset FF Proxy Settings, then click Go. Problem solved? If not, it's time to play hunt the malware...Malware removal In general, I've found that running Malwarebytes Anti-Malware in Safe Mode is the quickest way to remove malware that has evaded whichever anti-virus program you have installed. Start by saving the free MBAM to your desktop, updating its detection database, and running a quick scan. Remove any malware it finds, but don't stop there. Reboot your PC and keep pressing F8 before Windows loads, to bring up the boot menu (some PCs may use a different hotkey). When you get the boot menu, select Safe Mode, and run Malwarebytes again. If it finds any malware, delete it and repeat the process. Keep rebooting and re-running Malwarebytes until it doesn't find anything bad. You've already tried Malwarebytes so you may want to try an alternative such as Norton Power Eraser. It's another program that targets the sort of stuff that everyday anti-virus programs might miss, and it targets “scamware” in particular. Symantec warns that it is aggressive and may detect threats in legitimate programs, but at this stage, a bit of aggression is a good idea. If Malwarebytes and/or NPE don't find your malware, there are a few more targeted programs you can run. The ones worth trying include – in order – Bleeping Computer's RKill, Kaspersky Lab's TDSSKiller, SurfRight's HitmanPro, and Xplode's AdwCleaner. RKill tries to kill any known-bad processes running on your PC, which may be preventing other programs from running or finding malware. TDSSKiller finds rootkits. You can download all of these from Bleeping Computer's Downloads section. There are also lots of tutorials on the site to explain how to do things. When everything else fails, there's ComboFix. This has been developed by Bleeping Computer to tackle hard problems, and is used by many other anti-malware forums. However, unless you're an expert, it's not something you should run yourself. You should create an account at Bleeping Computer (or a similar website such as Geeks To Go), select the correct forum for your problem, and start a new query as explained in the Welcome Guide. One of the site's volunteers will try to help you to find a solution. This will often involve running RKill and ComboFix and posting logs from your PC, but you need to be familiar with the area to make sense of the logs.Updating Windows Malware is relatively rare on Windows nowadays, at least since we all stopped using 32-bit Windows XP – I've not found any on my 64-bit Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8 in more than half a decade of running multiple machines. However, that's mainly because I keep Windows and all my other software up to date. I run Secunia's Personal Software Inspector (PSI), which does a weekly scan, and I check Windows Update manually, often after Microsoft auto-installs updates on “Patch Tuesday”. I also minimise the amount of Adobe, Apple and Java code on my Windows PCs, though they all have Adobe Flash installed. Microsoft's SmartScreen filter has also helped a lot. When you run a new program, SmartScreen creates an SHA-256 hash of the executable code and sends this gibberish to a Microsoft server, which looks to see if the same hash is associated with any malware. If it is, it blocks the code or website and puts up a message to say that “Windows protected your PC”. Importantly, it provides protection against social engineering attacks (eg fake codec updates) and drive-by downloads. SmartScreen has been part of Internet Explorer but is now plumbed into Windows 8. Yes, it has some privacy implications, but they're nothing like as bad as downloading anything from the Windows Store, iTunes, Google Play or a similar service. You don't have to be perfect. Most malware writers target the “low hanging fruit” represented by the hundreds of millions of users who never install patches, run pirate copies of software with built-in back doors, or are still using Windows XP. Being up to date will not save you from a professional attack from the National Security Agency, GCHQ and other organisations with access to unknown or zero-day exploits, but unless you're a potential target, you're very unlikely to fall victim to one of those.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are now available in India - we saw lines forming outside Apple stores for the 7pm launch on Friday, showing that there's a fair amount of demand for these handsets in India. The iPhone 7 price starts at Rs. 60,000 and the iPhone 7 Plus starts at Rs. 72,000, but there are still plenty of deals you can go for to get a slightly cheaper phone. Aside from the new iPhone models, the Apple Watch series 2 is now available in India as well, from Rs. 32,000 onwards.Apart from the various e-commerce deals, Airtel and Reliance Jio are also giving special offers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Airtel's infinity plan is offering users 120GB of free 4G data, while Jio's iPhone offer gives users 12 months of free services including 20GB of data per month, and access to Jio services - a total bundle that the company pegs at being worth Rs. 18,000 for the year's use. Airtel has another offer where it is iPhone 7 at Rs. 19,990 and you can check out all the details here. Our own review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be coming soon, but first impressions have been very positive. You can also see exactly what all is inside the package you get through these unboxing photographs, or see the video below. A word of caution for all prospective buyers - the phone does not come with a 3.5mm audio jack - something that worried people into being willing to try anything. Including being fooled by a viral video that tricked them into drilling into their brand new phones. Don't drill holes into your phone, and instead check out our picks for alternatives you can use with your new iPhone. (Also see: Best Headphones to Use With the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus) If the iPhone release was big news in India, then Google had the attention on the global scale with the launch of the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL phones. The Pixel phones will be up for pre-order in India from next week, with the smaller Pixel being available at Rs. 57,000, while the Pixel XL starts at Rs. 66,000. The two phones are identical on all fronts except for the battery and screen - the Pixel has a 5-inch screen while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch screen. Both phones are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, with two cores clocked at 1.6GHz, and two cores clocked at 2.15GHz. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will pack 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and sport Pixel imprint fingerprint sensor. They sport a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX378 sensor, PDAF, f/2.0 aperture, and 1.55-micron pixels. Both sport an 8-megapixel front camera with a Sony IMX179 sensor, an f/2.4 aperture, and 1.4-micron pixels. The two phones also have some software tweaks that are exclusive for now, including early access to things such as Google Assistant and Android 7.1, and some features that will not trickle down, such as free, unlimited backup for pictures and videos. See full specifications of Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. (Also see: Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) Google also announced the launch of the new Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Google Wifi, and Google Daydream View. Apart from the iPhone, we saw another high profile phone launch in India this week - the Moto Z and Moto Mods. The phone was first launched in June but the global rollout started in September. Now, the phone has launched in India, with a starting price of Rs. 39,999. The cheaper Moto Z Play starts at Rs. 24,999. You'll be able to buy the phones from October 17, along with the Moto Mods - modular components that can dramatically add features to your phone. The Moto Mods connect to your phone via the 16-dot connector interface, and a number of them are going to be available in India. The JBL Soundboost costs Rs. 6,999, the Moto Insta-Share Projector costs Rs. 19,999, the Hasselblad True Zoom costs Rs. 19,999, the Incipio offGRID Power Pack costs Rs. 5,999, the Wood and Ballistic Nylon Motorola Style Shell costs Rs. 1,099, while the Leather Style Shell costs Rs. 1,599. These will all be available with a slight discount if you buy them with the phone. Other launches this week included the Lyf Wind 4S with 4000mAh battery and the Lyf Flame 7S with a 4-inch display. There was also the Asus ZenPad Z10 tablet with a 9.7-inch display and 4G LTE support. The Zen Cinemax Force also launched this week as did the Oppo F1SDiwali Edition that comes with a redesigned rear panel and Diwali theme. The Intex Aqua Strong 5.2 with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage also launched, and the Vivo Y55L with a 5.2-inch display. Sony also launched two premium cameras, the A6500 and Cyber-Shot RX100 V. The week also saw the big online sales coming to an end, with Flipkart, Snapdeal, and Amazon all reporting great sale numbers. Flipkart says customer saved over Rs. 1000 crore during its Big Billion Days Sale, while Amazon registered strong growth in mobile shoppers and Prime subscribers. Snapdeal says it saw total number of shoppers increase four times in the sale. The latest round of spectrum auctions also concluded this week, falling short of its target by a large margin. The auction began on October 1, with the goal of shoring up gaps in spectrum holdings, and Telecom Secretary J S Deepak said the next such sale may not happen for "quite some time". However, on day 2 the auction appeared to slow down and on day 3 the auction for the 700MHz and 900MHz bands saw no takers. These 4G bands continued to be ignored by operators on day 4, and on the final day the 900MHz band still saw no takers. (Also see: What Is Spectrum, and Why Is It Being Auctioned?) Aside from this, another interesting event this week was Oculus Connect 3, Facebook's virtual reality event. Facebook is making a Web browser for VR and it showed off a lot of developments from Oculus. It showcased the Oculus Touch motion controllers, which will be available from December, and finally brought up room-scale VR, which is a pretty big development. The company also talked about a VR device that fits between the PC-powered Oculus Rift and the mobile-powered Gear VR. At OC3, Facebook talked about a standalone device that would offer experiences somewhere between these two extremes, with inside-out positional tracking. Zuckerberg also showed off Oculus Rooms and the concept of "social VR", as he showed a demo of people hanging out, holding a conference, and watching movies together using the Oculus platform. And in news you're not likely to believe - a Nokia phone saved a man's life as it stopped a bullet. And no, it wasn't the old unbreakable seeming models either, but a modern Nokia featurephone. This is actually not the first time that a Nokia phone achieved this feat. In 2014, a Nokia Lumia 520 stopped a bullet fired at a Brazilian policeman, though the handset – predictably – got destroyed in the process.

The aim of the UAE’s Year of Reading is to nurture an entire generation of lifelong readers, and ensure the groundwork is in place to support the country’s knowledge economy goals. The mission of the ‘Celebrating Arabic Reading’ initiative is to make Arabic books more accessible for first-time online book readers and book lovers alike with unprecedented discounts of up to 90 per cent off on online books at the Google Play Books store, the world’s largest ebookstore that hosts more than 5 million titles and offers readers smart technology. Discounts are valid across nine countries in the Google Play Store (both in IOS and Android) for: the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. This is the first such online book initiative, and the first discount of this scale in the region at the Google Play Store. For a four-week period, Google will run its highest ever discount on the Play Books store on more than 4,000 popular fiction, non-fiction and children’s titles in an effort to reach millions of smartphone users in the Middle East and GCC. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman and chief executive, Emirates Airline and Group said: “Books can stimulate, inform, touch minds and hearts, and open up a world of possibilities for readers. As founding sponsors of the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature, we are staunch supporters of the written word. "Our ‘Celebrating Arabic Reading’ initiative with Google aims to encourage more people to read, and try out Arabic e-books. Smartphones and tablets are increasingly a part of our daily lives, so it makes perfect sense to promote reading on these new platforms as well. People are hungry for content, especially Arabic digital content, and there isn’t a smarter investment for the future of this region than providing access to e-books to broaden the horizons of millions.” Ronan Harris, vice president for Large Customer Sales for Google Europe Middle East and Africa said: “Technology has always played a pivotal role in providing people with equal access to information, and empowering them with knowledge. That’s something we’re very passionate about at Google and it’s in line with our core mission here in Mena to help promote and preserve local Arabic content on the web whether it was on YouTube, Search, Maps or Play. Through our collaboration with Emirates, we hope we can make Arabic literature more accessible and enjoyable than ever. There is so much opportunity to build the digital ecosystem here and we’re happy to have partners like Emirates make it happen.” To showcase the best of Arabic content, Emirates also commissioned the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature and the Emirates Literature Foundation to help identify and curate a collection of over 50 Arabic books in the Google Play Books store that will be discounted at 90 per cent off. This curated book collection encompasses a wide variety of bestselling fiction and nonfiction titles such as Rua Falsafia Fel Hekam Wal Forousia and Tell You About My Tribe, as well as a robust list of children's e-books like Creatures on the Ceiling, Altghrayib Al-Bilaliyah and I Love. Emirates actively supports and sponsors a number of educational and cultural initiatives in the UAE, including the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature, which last year attracted over 40,000 participants, 170 writers, thinkers and speakers from 35 countries. The airline also supports literature through its extensive audio-book section on ice, as well as engaging author interviews on Emirates World, a popular channel on ice. In addition, Emirates SkyCargo recently carried almost 8 tonnes of books to different parts of the world to support reading. Internet connectivity and mobile technology has helped cut the information divide in the Arab world. More people than ever own or have access to a digital device, whether it is a tablet, mobile phone or laptop. According to the Mobile Economy Arab States 2015 Report, over 200 million people across the region are subscribed to a mobile device, presenting a unique opportunity to deliver e-book and educational content. The UAE 2021 Vision and National Agenda includes a direct emphasis on Arabic language literacy. Data from 2014 shows that just under 60% of students are currently at this level in the UAE. By 2021, the UAE is targeting that 90 per cent of students have proficient Arabic literacy skills. According to Unesco research, 67 per cent of adults living in Arab states have basic literacy skills, compared to a global average of 82 per cent, underscoring the need for developing local, relevant Arabic content on the web which is central to information knowledge sharing. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Google | Emirates | Arabic | initiative | reading | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories VR, robots to become the future of theme parks Gulf Air adds Colombo to destination network Air Arabia Q3 net profit up 26pc Trump effect dampens ME tourism to the US Al Futtaim, InterCon ink deal for UAE's largest Holiday Inn Family-friendly staycation at Emirates Park Zoo and Resort Mövenpick Hotel West Bay Doha wins two top honours Emirates Skywards adds The Wall Street Journal to partner list Sharjah Museums takes centre stage at WTM London Jannah Hotels to open first RAK property in December Honda targets 80 business jets annually Modul Dubai starts hospitality management course Abu Dhabi airport interchange project on track New Doha 5-star hotel names resident manager Saudi Arabian Airlines names new CEO Jet Airways flies high with $850m revenue in Q2 Dubai hotels see occupancy, rates decline in October Bahrain Tourism Authority to take part in Jewellery Arabia Travco Group sells stakes in Air Arabia Egypt Fairmont The Palm appoints two new culinary talents WTM London closes on a high $24bn hotel projects under construction in Saudi, UAE Dubai South appoints TMIL for VIP Terminal branding Anniversary celebrations at Ramada Downtown Dubai Emirates moves to an all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleet VFS Global launches France visa service in Oman Exclusive Staycation packages at Al Raha Beach Hotel Emirates Skywards eases ground travel with Careem partnership Fairmont Hotel creates first tea etiquette guide Big success for Bahrain stand at WTM London Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

(Image: Google Inc) Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri -- enabling users to organise and use information on the devices and in the cloud -- to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort o provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, light bulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana -- a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" -- responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers. Thousands of people are expected to attend a World of Watson conference later this month in Las Vegas. amazon echo apple siri artificial intelligence artificial intelligence technology Trending Articles Scrapping Currency Cannot Deliver Corruption-Free India: Chinese media Tehchnology Will Help Develop Agricultural Pattern: Modi PM Narendra Modi, President Pranab Mukherjee Pay Tribute To Nehru on His 127th Birth Anniversary Congress Seeks Probe Into 'Huge Transactions' Prior to Demonetisation Trending Articles Scrapping Currency Cannot Deliver Corruption-Free India: Chinese media Tehchnology Will Help Develop Agricultural Pattern: Modi PM Narendra Modi, President Pranab Mukherjee Pay Tribute To Nehru on His 127th Birth Anniversary Congress Seeks Probe Into 'Huge Transactions' Prior to Demonetisation Scrapping Currency Cannot Deliver Corruption-Free India: Chinese media Tehchnology Will Help Develop Agricultural Pattern: Modi PM Narendra Modi, President Pranab Mukherjee Pay Tribute To Nehru on His 127th Birth Anniversary Congress Seeks Probe Into 'Huge Transactions' Prior to Demonetisation From Our Network Jayalalithaa releases first statement from hospital, says she has taken 'rebirth'- FirstPost Naxal-hit village in Latehar gets electricity for the first time - Pradesh18 Thousands throng gurdwaras to mark Gurpurab - Pradesh18 About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News To Ease Cash Crunch: Recalibrated ATMs, Old Notes For Utility Bills Till Nov 24 Scrapping Currency Cannot Deliver Corruption-Free India: Chinese media Tehchnology Will Help Develop Agricultural Pattern: Modi PM Narendra Modi, President Pranab Mukherjee Pay Tribute To Nehru on His 127th Birth Anniversary Happy Children's Day: Sridevi to Urmila; 8 Child Actors Who Became Bollywood Sensations Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. Also read: Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Full specs, top features, India price and everything you need to know "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Also read: Pixel, Pixel XL: Google's phones should make Apple, Samsung et al nervous Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."
