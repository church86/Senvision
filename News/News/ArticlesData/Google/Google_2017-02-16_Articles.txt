Digital Trends Home > Mobile > App Attack: Flipboard’s big update tailors… App Attack: Flipboard’s big update tailors magazines just for you By Julian Chokkattu — February 12, 2017 9:00 AM Subscribe Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Flipboard is one of the most popular news-reading apps, and Version 4.0 makes it easy to find content tailored to your interests. Pre-installed apps like Apple News and Google’s multiple news-aggregating apps may enjoy a large base of users, but for a long time Flipboard was the default news reader on most smart devices. Now vying for the spotlight again, the app making a comeback with a revamp that uses machine learning to personalize and improve reader experience. Version 4.0 focuses on Smart Magazines, which let you create a personalized magazine with more granular preferences. You’ve been able to create magazines before — in fact, Flipboard said more than 28 million magazines were created by users last March — but Smart Magazines go a step further thanks to human curation, machine learning, and more. More: Google is fighting fake news in France with a new project called CrossCheck Because of these granular controls and options, it’s unlikely your Flipboard will match someone else’s — even if they’re interested in similar categories. For example, if you click on “Photography,” you get the option to narrow your interest even further down to “Canon” or “Nikon,” and more. These magazines are automatically updated. You can create up to nine smart magazines that will appear on the home screen, and any others will show up as tiles on another screen.  Furthermore, the more you use and interact with the app — by liking or sharing an article, for example — the better Flipboard gets at offering up content you’ll enjoy reading. Here’s how you can create a Smart Magazine: Scroll to the right where you’ll see “What’s your passion?” in big, bold text. Here you can either type a category in, or choose one from the list below — like “Travel,” “Technology,” or “Business.” You’ll then see a “Personalize” page come up — choose hashtags that you want to see in your magazine, like #SiliconValley, or #Wearables. More: Tinder for moms? Peanut app helps get gang together for friendship, playdates These options help hone in on your passion, so that you’ll get a unique feed that’s tailored to you. You can add or remove hashtags at any time by tapping on the three dots on the top right corner of the magazine, and then hitting “Personalize.” You can also move around magazines on the home screen by tapping “Edit Home,” which sits below. The version 4.0 update is available for iOS and Android, and you can grab it on the App Store and the Google Play Store.
Digital Trends Home > Web > You can now explore seven countries in Africa… You can now explore seven countries in Africa thanks to Google Street View By Lulu Chang — February 12, 2017 12:15 PM Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you If you've ever wanted to explore the National Parks of Uganda or see the National Theatre of Ghana, Google is giving you a chance. Globetrotting can be hard, but Google is here to make it easier — not when it comes to flight and hotel accommodations, but rather with an ever-expanding repository of the most incredible sights from around the world. Google has added some of the highlights from the majestic continent of Africa to its Google Street View knowledge base and starting today, you’ll be able to take virtual tours of “some of the most iconic landmarks and monuments in Ghana, Senegal, and Uganda.” You can now explore a total of 81 countries without ever leaving your home by way of Google Street View, seven of which are located in Africa. There’s the UNESCO World Heritage-classified village of Nzulezo in Ghana, built over Lake Tadane, whose stilt-supported structures are integrated with the water-centric landscape of the area. More: Watch this astounding trip around the world, made entirely from Google Maps You can also pay a virtual visit to the National Theatre of Ghana, which houses the National Dance Company, the National Symphony Orchestra, and the National Theatre Players. For a different kind of art, you can head over to Senegal’s African Renaissance monument, a bronze statue that rises 49 meters into the air. Or you can look at natural landmarks like the pink-watered Lake Retba. Google partnered with the Uganda Wildlife Authority to virtually bring you to seven of that country’s most famous National Parks, home to various primate species and more than 600 species of birds. “We are excited that what began with a few South African cities in 2009, has now expanded to many other cities in 7 countries across the continent,” Google concluded, “From Cape Town to Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania and now Ghana, Uganda and Senegal, we are glad that more people from around the world are turning to Street View to to get a glimpse of this beautiful continent. We wouldn’t be surprised if you’ll be tempted to pack your own cameras to explore in person as well!”
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google Assistant might be coming to your non-Pixel… Google Assistant might be coming to your non-Pixel device sooner rather than later By Lulu Chang — February 12, 2017 1:55 PM Subscribe Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Google Assistant has long been unique to Google Pixel and Pixel XL handsets, but a new alpha test suggests that Google could be spreading the love. You don’t have to go out and get a Google Pixel in order to get Google Assistant — rather, it would appear that the AI tool is beginning to make its way onto non-Pixel hardware. As first reported by Android Police, it looks as though an alpha version of the Google app has appeared in the wild by way of the version 6.13 update, and while it’s rather buggy, it’s the first time we’re able to see Assistant on a phone that isn’t a Pixel or Pixel XL. As Android Police noted, both a Nexus 6P (running Android 7.1.1) and a Samsung Galaxy Note5 (running Android 6.0.1) were able to launch Google Assistant with the user simply holding the Home button. After a few moments, a dialogue with the message “New! You just got the Google Assistant” popped up, and allowed for users to set up voice training. More: Google Assistant adds another 10 skills, including a virtual sommelier Be warned, however, that given that this is still an alpha version of the newest software, it’s working better for some than it is for others. It doesn’t seem to be linked to device type (some Nexus 6Ps got Assistant to work, while others didn’t), though it could be contingent on phone settings or other app versions. Regardless, the very presence of Google Assistant on v6.13 could mean exciting things for folks who have been waiting to get Google Assistant on their existing Android devices. While we’re not rushing to any conclusions, it could be the case that Assistant will be made available to everyone when v6.13 becomes officially available. However, it’s also possible that some devices got Assistant as an error when mistakenly identified as a Pixel handset in settings (that said, the introductory messages that new users received suggest that this was not an error). Regardless, we’ll have to wait a bit longer to see exactly when Google Assistant becomes more widely available, but perhaps not as long as previously thought.

Abhijit Ahaskar AI specifically refers to the enhanced ability that a piece of software may have, where it can understand specific information, add contextual knowledge to it and suggest responses based on that. Artificial intelligence, popularly referred to as AI, is no longer seen only in movies and TV series. Many of us are already taking advantage of it through mobile apps and smartphones. AI specifically refers to the enhanced ability that a piece of software may have, where it can understand specific information, add contextual knowledge to it and suggest responses based on that. For example, the suggestion about which content to view on YouTube has an element of AI working in the background. Smarter photo and filter apps Available by default in many Android smartphones, Google Photos uses AI and machine learning to identify objects or human faces in a photo and club ones with common elements and the same faces into specific folders without the user’s intervention. It is this ability to understand the content in a photo which makes Google Photos better than an ordinary photo storage app. This also makes it easier for users to find images they want quickly. A number of photo and video filter apps such as Prisma and Artisto use AI to apply filters. Prisma uses AI and a set of neural networks to understand the contents of an image to convert an ordinary photo into a beautiful work of art. Click here for enlarge Chatting made fun Google’s instant messaging app Allo uses AI and language processing tools to understand how a user converses with friends and the built-in personal assistant on the messenger. It focuses more on the context and content in a message so it can come up with smart suggestions and more accurate answers. Its accuracy depends on how much time you spend on the messenger. The more you use it, the more accurate and interesting its suggestions will become. Allo can also detect content in photos shared with the user to suggest a more appropriate reply. Typing made easy Typing on touchscreen phones is not as comfortable as typing on a proper keyboard. This is where predictive text input, a feature of touch-based keyboards, can help users overcome the limitations of small keys and keyboards. Click here for enlarge Microsoft’s SwiftKey takes it a step further by using AI to understand the context in what is typed to provide more accurate text predictions and auto correction options to users when they are typing. It focuses on a user’s writing style and factors in the entire sentence and not just a few words. So, if you type “We are excited for”, SwiftKey’s predictions will be “New Year” and “Future” which can actually help complete the sentence. Making smartphones actually smart What makes Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones unique is the AI assistant that has been incorporated into the phone’s software. At the start, it seems like another voice-based personal assistant such as Apple’s Siri or Microsoft’s Cortana, but brings a lot more to the table. Like the AI in the Allo, it creates a virtual image of a user based on his queries, commands and browser history, so it can understand the context in query better and provide more appropriate suggestions. HTC has deployed a similar AI tool called Sense Companion in the HTC U Ultra and U Play smartphones. It works on similar lines as Google Assistant and uses machine learning to understand a user’s interest and tastes to provide better suggestions and improve their overall experience with the phone. For example, it will give more priority to notifications from apps that are regularly used or contacts that are more frequently called. AI in smartphones is still at a very nascent stage. The way we interact with smartphones is not going to change anytime soon, but the coming of AI into our lives shows its immense potential.

The Irish Independent states that these talks have been on-going for some two months and that Google is prepared to spend up to €125m on the Dublin property. This is well above the building's estimated value of €100m. The building is a short walk from Google's European HQ - the company is believed to be bringing 400 new jobs to the capital. It was wildly reported in January that Google is planning to create more roles in Dublin if it can find the right office space. Agents CBRE are managing the sale of one-third of the for Percy Nominees. The building was constructed in 1989 by Ambiorix, a company controlled by  Johnny Ronan, Paddy McKillen Jr and Liam Cunningham - it owns 67% of the property. The Treasury Building generates rent of more than €5m per annum. Google currently employs more than 6,000 people in Ireland. The internet giant has previously spent €99m and €100m on its current office blocks at Dublin's Grand Canal Dock. The NTMA is preparing to move to a new office on Dublin's North Wall Quay.

Image: Andy bridgewater By Sasha Lekach2017-02-16 03:33:30 UTC After an apparently very influential career talk with her father, 7-year-old Chloe Bridgewater decided to go where many hopeful job seekers have gone before: the Google careers page.  SEE ALSO: Third grader has no time for your silly homework nonsense After submitting her version of an application to work at Google (addressed to "google boss"), she waited for a response. But instead of the dreaded non-response or generic form letter, she received a letter from the company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, just a few days later. Google confirmed the letters between the tech CEO and young girl from Hereford, England, are real. Letter-writer Chloe with her career coach and dad. Image: andy bridgewater In the letter, which wasn't exactly a rejection but more of a supportive message, Pichai wrote, "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :)" He added encouragement for the girl to keep learning about computers, robots and technology, saying, "you can accomplish everything you set your mind to." my 7 yr old daughter wrote to the boss of Google asking for a job, she's so made up he replied! Thanks @sundarpichai pic.twitter.com/EMuANNHiVc — Andy Bridgewater (@B21DGY) February 13, 2017 This all started when a few weeks ago, her father, Andy Bridgewater, said in an email Wednesday. When the first-grade student asked her dad about his job as a refrigerator parts sales manager, he told her what he did. She then asked if there was anywhere else he'd want to work.  That's when Bridgewater told his daughter about Google. "I said Google would be cool and she asked why. So I showed her the pictures of their offices and the cool things they do." She was hooked after seeing the decked out Google campus in Silicon Valley, complete with bean bags, slides and go-karts.  When she said she wanted to work there too, he suggested she send an application, so she did (with some help from dad). In her "application," she was very up front about not really knowing how to apply for a job. "I don't really know what one of them is but [dad] said a letter will do for now," she wrote. She also offered up other possible careers if Google didn't pan out: chocolate factory worker and swimming in the Olympics. Image: andy bridgewater Like any good cover letter, she propped herself up: "My teachers tell my mum and dad I am very good in class and am good at my spelling and reading and my sums." And she gave specifics to show her skills. "My dad gave me a game where I have to move a robot up and down squares, he said it will be good for me to learn about computers." Bridgewater said he has no Google connections and his entire family — also consisting of his wife Julie and younger daughter Hollie — haven't even been to California. So he just sent the letter "and hoped for the best."  Her dad posted Pichai's response letter to his LinkedIn page earlier this week, where he explained how getting a response has given Chloe a confidence boost. "She is now even more eager to do well at school and work for Google." That post has been liked more than 94,000 times. For Chloe, who is still a kid and mentally healing from a scary car accident a few years ago when a taxi knocked her over, this is all a lot to handle, but still really exciting and encouraging, Bridgewater said. "Never imagined all this attention," he said.  As Chloe explained to Pichai, this was only her second letter she's written aside from one to Father Christmas — bet she didn't get this much of a reaction to that letter.  BONUS: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious Topics: Parenting, UK, Family & Parenting, Google, job-applicant, Sundar Pichai, Watercooler, Work & Play About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The reply to Chloe Bridgewater’s letter was sent by none other than the Google CEO ‘Sundar Pichai’. Andy Bridgewater, the girl’s father, shared a post on his LinkedIn account mentioning how his daughter was impressed with an image of the Google office having bean bags, go karts and slides. The girl then decided to write a letter to Google asking for a job. The girl very cleverly writes how she likes swimming, computers and playing games on her tab. She also mentions her good performance in her class and how her father motivates her to learn computers and get a job at Google in the future.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google, Amazon want smart speakers to be hands-free phones JC Torres - Feb 16, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit That smart speaker in your living room is just about to get smarter. Or maybe more invasive, for that matter. Google and Amazon, two companies that dabble in smartphones (or previously, for Amazon) are reportedly mulling over evolving their Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers from smart home hubs to part time hands-free smartphones. While it might seem like a small step, considering how both companies already have strong presences in the mobile market, it is going to be a big leap in terms of what the companies may or may not collect from users. Amazon Echo and Google Home would effectively become the modern equivalent of speaker phones. It isn’t an alien concept but it’s still an awkward behavior for many in practice. Even more so in this case, as you will be speaking to a speaker rather than to a phone. Then again, the Amazon Echo has almost become commonplace that speaking to a canister no long feels too weird anymore. One consideration for this new feature is whether the speakers themselves will connect to phone lines. They could, for example, get their own numbers or perhaps tap into existing land lines or smartphones. Either way, new hardware would be required at the very least, which means this generation of speakers could be left out in the cold. The biggest hurdle that the two companies will face, however, won’t be the technical. It will, instead, be about privacy. Technically, these speakers already do record some amount of audio all the time, which it requires in order to have that always listening effect. Phone conversations, however, are entirely different can of worms. Naturally, the two companies will promise they won’t record conversations, but they will most likely still harvest some metadata out of it. Such a new phase of development could throw a wrench in Apple’s plans of launching its own Siri-powered speaker. Rumors indicate that such a device is still in the prototyping stage, which could mean that Apple will be terribly late for the party when it does launch.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Telenor rolls out Google’s RCS messaging to Android users in Europe and Asia Emil Protalinski@EPro February 16, 2017 12:00 AM Tags: Android, Google, RCS, Telenor Google and Norwegian carrier Telenor partnered today to give Android users Rich Communication Services (RCS) in Europe and Asia. Although SMS is the standard for mobile messaging, it’s just plain text. RCS is one of many attempts to offer a more enhanced messaging experience out of the box. The default SMS app on Android — unless the carrier decides to change it — is called Messenger. Google is using this app to push its implementation of RCS so that Android phones can offer features like group messaging, IP voice calls, and file-sharing. The service is powered by the Jibe RCS cloud (Google acquired Jibe in September 2015). Google brought RCS to Sprint users (U.S.) in November and Rogers users (Canada) in December. Telenor is the third carrier to come into the fold, which is a big deal given its services are not limited to just one country. Starting today, Telenor customers with Android phones are getting features like group chat, high-resolution photo sharing, and read receipts. The carrier is bringing RCS to its 214 million subscribers across Europe and Asia, including Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, and India. All customers need to do is download the latest version of Messenger for Android from Google Play. Much like Google’s deal with Sprint and Rogers, Telenor’s partnership also includes preloading Messenger as the standard messaging app for new Android devices next year. While Google is certainly making headway, it will be years before a significant number of Android users have access to RCS. Furthermore, carriers are implementing the standard in different ways. So far, Google has three on board, but there’s no indication other carriers want to use Google’s RCS. It’s also unfortunate that the company is pushing Messenger on these new Android phones, instead of one unified messaging app. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

By India Ashok February 16, 2017 08:15 GMT Google researchers noted that the hacker group primarily used its first-stage malware Sofacy for a large number of attacksReuters A leaked private report by Google from 2014, reportedly reveals that the tech giant was aware of cyberespionage group APT28, also known as Fancy Bear and Sofacy among others, much before cybersecurity experts linked the high profile DNC hack to the state-sponsored hacker group. The leaked report also reportedly details that Google hinted that the group worked for the Kremlin. Google titled the report "Peering into the Aquarium", considered to be a subtle and clever reference to the headquarters of Russian military intelligence unit GRU (Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye), which is popularly known as "The Aquarium". Google researchers noted that the APT28's two malware variants, Sofacy and X-Agent, "are used by a sophisticated state-sponsored group targeting primarily former Soviet republics, NATO members, and other Western European countries." "It looks like Google researchers were well aware of Sofacy before it was publicly disclosed," Matt Suiche, security researcher and the founder of Comae Technologies told Motherboard, after reviewing the report. "And also attributed Sofacy and X-Agent to Russia before it was publicly done by FireEye, ESET or CrowdStrike." In the report, Google researchers noted that the hacker group primarily used its first-stage malware Sofacy for a large number of attacks. However, it used its more customised and sophisticated X-Agent malware when going after "high-priority targets". "Sofacy was three times more common than X-Agent in the wild, with over 600 distinct samples," Google's report stated. Google's report also stated that Georgia had the highest submissions rate of X-Agent malware to VirusTotal, the public malware repository acquired by the tech giant in 2012, indicating that the country was a high-priority target for the attackers at one point. Despite being fairly dated, Google's report reveals APT28's sophisticated cyberespionage activities and techniques, much before the group became known to the world. The report also sheds light on how a tech giant like Google can collect data on government hacker groups thanks to the kind of data it can access.

X AI research needs to be done in the open - Google chair Eric Schmidt tells RSA conference that machine learning capabilities should not be confined to military research labs about 3 hours ago Elain Edwards in San Francisco Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent Alphabet, told the RSA conference in San Francisco that research on machine learning and artificial intelligence needs to be done in the open and not by military research labs. (Photograph: Tony Avelar/Bloomberg)         Research on machine learning and artificial intelligence needs to be done in the open and not by military research labs, Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent Alphabet has said. Mr Schmidt was speaking at the RSA Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. Some 40,000 security professionals have been attending the event this week. Security threats discussed at hundreds of sessions include the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee in advance of the US presidential election last year, as well as threats to business, to government and to internet-connected devices. In conversation with journalist Gideon Lewis-Kraus, Mr Schmidt said machine learning capabilities, which allow computers to learn without being programmed, needed to be done in the open and not by military research labs. Mr Schmidt said that under a different scenario, “we’d spend all day worrying if they (the military) were in our networks; we wouldn’t know what they were doing. “The internet would begin to start getting shut down because of fear of the Russians or the Chinese or bilaterally,” he said. He said one of the questions the industry should be asking was whether it could come up with a way where countries would agree to not use machine learning technologies in a way that militarised the internet - “in other words a demilitarisation plan”. “Maybe I’m an optimist, but I’d like to see some discussions about that,” he said. Reiterating a fear he has written about in the past, Mr Schmidt said he was “extremely worried” about the likelihood that countries would begin to block the openness and interconnectedness of the internet. Globalisation and economic re-growth were dependent on such openness, he added. Mr Schmidt noted there had been a meeting last year between then US president Barack Obama and the Chinese president Xi Jinping in which they had agreed to reduce the number of attacks from China on the US. ADVERTISEMENT “I think getting the governments to agree that we are better off collectively by having a more open internet with less attacking - especially at nation state level - would be a clear improvement for everybody.” Google on Wednesday announced it was making available a new open source library called Tensorflow 1.0, which the company uses internally for machine learning. “We are doing this because we want to stimulate the (artificial intelligence) industry. We want you to build these solutions and identify these new opportunities,” Mr Schmidt said. He remarked on early machine learning techniques over a decade ago which had “discovered” the concept of cats on YouTube. “I would have liked them to discover something more profound. I was very upset,” he said. In a keynote address to the conference on Wednesday, Dr Hugh Thompson, chief technology officer of Symantec, thinking differently about analytics could transform the field of security. He said most discussion around the Internet of Things was currently about things that had been hacked, including cars and botnets. Most of the energy was currently being directed into the exposition of weaknesses in devices and a lot of people working on the security aspect were “still at the stage where we’re trying to comprehend how bad could this be”, he said. He proposed a standard for IoT devices that might look like a food label, which every single device would have physically attached or which would get transmitted digitally. It would list properties such as whether the device had Bluetooth connectivity. He suggested every device might also come with a behaviour graph to monitor what it should be doing. The conference concludes on Friday.       Topics: Eric Schmidt Google Read More Hackers will attack major infrastructure, conference hears Indeed begins advertising first of 500 new positions in Ireland Facebook says disclosures to US agencies have ‘appropriate safeguards’ How a Dublin teenager is helping you bring your secrets to the grave Verizon close to buying Yahoo’s core internet business Sex, drugs (well, coffee) and big data at the Dublin Tech Summit Cyber security experts warned of a hacked world MagGrow and MooCall selected for Alltech’s agri-tech accelerator Retroblox console goes modular to grip gamers Analytics firm NewsWhip raises $6.4m to fund expansion Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Personal Finance Just one in three of private sector workers have a pension Technology Adventure gaming for fans of Norse mythology Rugby Kieran Keane a strong contender be next Connacht coach Innovation The great innovation debate: has the revolution stalled?

Laszlo Bock, senior vice president of people operations at Google and the author of the new book, "Work Rules! Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead," gave ABC News a peek into how Google tackles a problem. Mark Zuckerberg Reveals His Hiring Secret Google Co-Founder Says People Shouldn't Have to Work So Much Bill Gates Reveals What Makes Him Feel 'Pretty Stupid' "The way we approach it is with data," Bock said. "What we do is we have a problem, we get a set of facts and someone takes one position and someone takes an opposing position." For instance: One difficult decision was whether Google should continue offering search results in mainland China. "We supplemented it with data as much as we could and argued until we reached a decision," Bock said. Google shut down its search engine in mainland China in 2009 in protest of the country's online censorship. Since then, access to Google's suite of products has been severely limited and blocked in China. Other times, a decision is made because it is the "right thing to do" and the data comes later -- such as when Google expanded its maternity leave from 12 weeks to four months, including salary and bonuses. "We later discovered the data supported it and it made people happier," Bock said. TKTKTK |Eric Laurits Laszlo Bock, Google's senior vice president of people operations, is revealing insights from Google in his new book "Work Rules!" While working at Google may be a dream for many people, the company hires only 0.4 percent of 2 million applicants, according to Bock, making Google around 25 more times selective than Harvard or Stanford. Many of those who apply to Google won't even get an interview. However, Bock said, there are plenty of takeaways from Google that could be used in other companies to create a balance of structure and creativity. Google employees famously dine for free in the company's cafes and Bock said it's not because they "want people to be stuck on our campus." "We offer perks to build community," he said. "We do the cafes because we want people to bump into each other." It's those moments, Bock said, where Google's product ideas are often born -- including Google News. Perks are also offered to "make life easier for people" and aren't a total free ride. For instance, Bock said Googlers can enjoy on-site oil changes and drop their dry cleaning off at the office. "You pay for it, but it makes life easier for you. Most of them cost us nothing," he said. "The question is: Why don’t most companies do these type of things." For those people who dream of a job at Google, Bock offers this advice: "Don’t do the gimmicks," he said. "Literally, last week we received a 16-by-16 wooden crate and we opened it up and there was a robot inside." The robot had a button asking to be pushed. Not only did it not work but "this poor person spent all this time, effort, money and care, and it arrived -- and, yeah, we saw it, but it didn’t work or do anything to make us want to interview them." The bottom line, Bock said, is: "Just apply." 0 Shares Email Star Comments " The Geeky Way Google Makes Tough Decisions China carfentanil ban a 'game-changer' for opioid epidemic AP NewsAlert Colorado's 834 million dead trees threaten to worsen fires Gene editing patent ruling sways fortune of biotech hopefuls Yahoo issues another warning in fallout from hacking attacks Yahoo warns users of potential malicious activity on their accounts between 2015 and 2016 Swedish supermarket tests lasers to label organic produce French president calls for more cybersecurity for election " Ohio zoo's polar bear moves to Chicago to find romance " House Republicans seek investigation into potential illegal DOJ leaks " Trump's secretary of labor pick Puzder withdraws nomination " Guilty plea expected involving San Bernardino terror attack Democrats and some Republicans want to stop Trump from lifting Russia sanctions

By KI MAE HEUSSNER May 11, 2010 0 Shares Email Star /ABC News 0 Shares Email For most of us, it will likely never be more than an idle threat. But what happens if you actually do decide to sign off from Facebook -- for good? Frustrated by privacy changes or perhaps simply overwhelmed by the non-stop online chatter, Facebook users sometimes say it's time to go cold turkey. But a few really do follow through. After Facebook's most recent changes and the discovery of a (now-fixed) security hole that let users see friends' chats, complaints from Facebook users erupted last week in comment threads and even a dedicated protest page on the site. But Peter Rojas, co-founder of the popular user-generated gadget site gdgt, announced on Twitter that he was actually going to cut the cord. "I was spending more time managing my account than actually using my account," he toldABCNews.com. "Having to constantly monitor the privacy settings was way too complicated. You can never be sure if you actually caught everything." Before Deactivation, Facebook Lists Friends Who Will Miss You Rojas said that though he never expected others in the tech community to respond to his action, he thinks the Facebook privacy issue is a big one. "I'm happy to use the site, but I don't want to be sharing my private updates [and] personal information with other Web sites," he said. After hitting the "deactivate" button listed under "Account Settings," he said the site tried to convince him to stay. Before completing the process, Facebook asks the question "Are you sure you want to deactivate your account?" and displays pictures of a few friends, captioned with the lines "[Friend's name here] will miss you." "It just seemed really desperate in a way that Facebook doesn't need to be desperate," he said. Maybe someone at Facebook thought it might be a clever way to bid departing users farewell, he said, but it "just seems kind of weird to be so almost pathetic. They certainly don't need to do that. It's not like they're hemorrhaging users." But according to the tech blog Search Engine Land, more and more people seem to be at least curious about how to delete their Facebook pages. Tech Blog: More People Searching for How to Delete Facebook Accounts In a blog post Monday, editor-in-chief Danny Sullivan said that while doing a "how do I" search on Google he noticed that "how do I delete my facebook account" was one of the top suggested search topics. According to Google, suggested search topics are based on the queries of others and are determined algorithmically without human intervention. The popularity of search terms is one of the factors used in the algorithm. To see how recent the Facebook trend was, Sullivan used Google Trends, which shows the popularity of certain searches over certain periods of time. Although there was not enough search volume for "how do I delete my facebook account," he said he found something interesting when he entered "delete facebook account." "Yes, there is definitely a rising trend," he wrote. "Over time, more and more searches at Google have involved it, it appears." Facebook Users Can Deactivate or Permanently Delete Accounts He also wrote that if you start typing in "delete" into the Google search box, the first suggested topic is "delete facebook account." Facebook gives users the option to deactivate or delete their accounts, though listed under "Account Settings," the deactivate option is much easier to locate. To find the delete option, users have to search for the option in the site's "Help Center." If a user decides to deactivate an account, the profile information is no longer available on Facebook, but the site still saves all of the information in case the user returns. "We preserve the account in its entirety. People often deactivate for temporary reasons and expect their content and information to be there for them when they return," a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. The user is taken off Community pages, photos tagged with her are de-tagged and status updates or other information posted to her own page are taken down. Posts on friends' walls remain, but the person's name appears in unclickable text. Facebook Waits 14 Days Before Deleting Account Still, Facebook said third-party applications or sites might be able to hold on to that information "to the extent permitted by our policies." If a user turned over credit card information on Facebook to buy virtual gifts or make other purchases, that information is also retained by Facebook. The social network said there is no limit on how long a user can keep her account deactivated. But if a Facebook user really wants to make the separation permanent, she can choose to delete the account altogether. If a user goes to the "Help Center" and searches for "delete account," she is directed to a link that lets her send a deletion request to Facebook. Once they receive the request, the spokesman said the site waits 14 days before deleting the account. "Because deletion is irreversible, this allows people who mistakenly submitted a request to let us know so we can cancel it," the Facebook spokesman said. After the 14 days, Facebook said it purges the user's information from the site. The policy says copies of some materials may remain for "technical reasons," but Facebook did not immediately explain this further. Though Facebook said it collects information about how many users have deactivated or deleted accounts, the spokesman said it generally does not publicize that information. Industry Watcher: Facebook Continues to Grow Still, despite user complaints and possible curiosity about leaving the site, industry watchers say Facebook appears to be attracting even more people. "The site is still growing really fast as far as we can tell. It's growing fast, especially some of the younger [users], men and women in their 20s," said Eric Eldon, co-editor of the Inside Network, which runs the Inside Facebook blog. He said Facebook grew by at least 4 million U.S. users in March to reach 117 monthly unique visitors and added about 20 million global users to reach more than 400 million users worldwide. "One concern at this point is that Facebook can do so many changes that eventually people get fed up and delete their accounts, or at least stop using the site regularly," he said. But "that's always a concern but it hasn't happened yet." "Maybe Facebook is so ingrained in people's lives so it's not a risk," he continued. "This is all such new territory." 0 Shares Email Star Comments " What Happens When You Quit Facebook?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 2:09 PM Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones by mark gurman Ambitious plans: A file photo of Huawei's mobile phones. The company is working on an assistant that would communicate in Chinese languages and target domestic users while continuing to work with Google and Amazon's Alexa service outside China, a source said. — Reuters Huawei Technologies Co, the third-largest smartphone maker, is preparing to enter the competitive world of digital assistants with its own voice-powered service, people familiar with the matter said.  A team of more than a hundred engineers is in the early stages of developing the technology at its Shenzhen, China offices, one of the people said. The efforts are extensive and are aimed at Apple Inc's Siri, Amazon.com Inc's Alexa, and Alphabet Inc's Google Assistant, not smaller players, the person said.  Huawei's assistant would communicate in Chinese languages and target domestic users while the company will continue to work with Google and Amazon's Alexa service outside China, a one of the other people said. They asked not to be identified as the details are private.   Building its own answer to Siri may help Huawei devices stand out in a crowded Chinese market, where many Google services that come with the dominant Android smartphone operating system are blocked.   Huawei is targeting US$33bil (RM147.08bil) in sales from its consumer business this year. The company trails only Apple and Samsung Electronics Co in global smartphone shipments as it pushes upmarket with premium features.   Having a major Android device manufacturer choose to build a voice assistant in-house may throw another wrench in Google's plans. Huawei last month announced it would use Alexa on its Mate 9 smartphones in the US. Currently, the Google Assistant only runs on Google's Pixel smartphone, Home speaker and smartwatches running the latest version of the Android Wear software. The largest online search company is trying to get third-party device makers to pre-install its assistant, according to people familiar with the talks.  Spokespeople for Huawei and Google declined to comment.   Huawei is not the first Android device manufacturer to develop its own service over using Google's.   Samsung acquired Viv Labs last year, a startup formed by some Siri founders, to serve as the basis for its own voice assistant. Samsung plans to release the first devices with this new technology later this year. Chinese search giant Baidu Inc announced its own voice service in 2015. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Ford bets big on artificial intelligence Spotify expands with World Trade Centre move Clash of Clans maker profit up despite Pokemon challenge Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Others Also Read Spanish giants to host coaching clinics at college in Negri Sembilan Places to go on a weekend Made to match an active lifestyle advertisement Latest News Bank Negara to work closely with Cabinet on forex losses Carpool and save with GrabShare DBS profit slumps to two-year low on oil and gas bad debts Maybank Indonesia posts record earnings in FY16 Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Carpool and save with GrabShare Stand up to cancer Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Google Home: Gene Munster Breaks It Down Shanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ?

(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), named Echo and Google Home, respectively. Based on a test, in which 800 different everyday queries were posed to Amazon Echo and Google Home, Loup Ventures found Google's fared better, answering 39.1 percent of the queries correctly compared to Echo's 34.4 percent. Meanwhile Echo understood 94.4 percent of the queries compared to 77 percent for Google Home, the firm noted. Test Results Along Lines of Core Strength Analyzing the results, Munster noted Amazon fared better on queries related to commerce, while Google did well on information. The queries asked were divided into five categories, namely local, commerce, navigation, information and command. With Amazon Prime members now being able to order products via voice control, Munster believes Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant service, can only help re-order simple, consumable products. He also pointed to reports of Amazon working on introducing an Echo model with a touchscreen sometime in 2017. Meanwhile, the analyst noted Google Home's role in commerce was restricted to giving store recommendations and price quotes. Loup Ventures believes Google Home's advantage is in information, though it fared better than Echo in navigation and command categories as well. This, according to the firm, is facilitated by Google Assistant's ability to engage in two-way conversations. This contrasts with Alexa, which needs to be asked complete individual queries each time and can't engage in two-way dialogue. Related Link: Ask Siri: How Will You Keep Up Amazon's Alexa? Strengths Vs. Weakness of Home Assistants Strength: Loup Ventures outlined Home audio control as the strength of Home Assistants, with Echo and Google Home being able to connect with Spotify, Pandora Media Inc (NYSE: P) and TuneIn. Additionally, Echo has access to Amazon Music and iHeartRadio and Google Assistant has access to Google Play Music and YouTube Music, the firm added. However, the firm noted that Echo is constrained by the necessity of Echo owners to be Amazon Prime Music or Spotify Premium subscribers to play specific songs. Weakness : Noting that Navigation Support and Reminders are the weaknesses, Loup Ventures said these are minor issues that will be fixed in the future. Next Logical Step Munster sees a bright future for these platforms as companions to VR and AR. The analyst believes the next logical step is adding third-party developers to the mix. Amazon already offers third-party add-ons, which it calls as skills, the analyst noted. Unlike Amazon, the analyst noted that Google is not needing users to download or enable skills but it announced conversation actions platform. This platform allows developers to create back-and-forth conversations with users through Google Assistant. Munster said he expects others, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), to push further into the space. "Our homes have just begun to be connected and we expect home assistants to be one of the centerpieces of managing our lives in the future," Munster said.

But the ratio of women to men in the tech world is still laughable. Luckily, 7-year-old Chloe Bridgewater is out to change that. This kid, who is a fan of computers as well as those much-touted tech-giant office amenities, up and applied for a job at Google recently. That's a cute enough story as it is, but get this: Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a really sweet response. Business Insider published Chloe's application letter, which was shared by her father, Andy Bridgewater. The missive aptly begins "Dear Google boss," and makes a pretty solid case for hiring Chloe. After all, she is experienced in tablet usage, computer games, swimming, spelling, reading, sums, and robot-moving. What more could a potential employer ask for, really? "My dad told me that if I carry on being good and learning things that one day I will be able to have a job at Google," Chloe writes. She explains that she doesn't know what a job application is, but hopes that her letter will do for now. "Thank you for reading my letter," she concludes. "I have only ever sent one other and that was to Father Christmas. Good bye." Pichai responded to thank Chloe for her letter and to admire her many achievements. "I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to — from working at Google to swimming in the Olympics," he said. "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school!" He even threw in a smiley-face emoji for good measure (and because, technology). Well done, Pichai. We're pretty sure Chloe is going to be the CEO of Google in 20 years or so — and imagine how silly you'd feel if you hadn't responded so nicely to her job application. Although if she changes her official title from CEO to "Google Boss," that's cool too.

GROW Here's What Happened When a 7-Year-Old Girl Applied to Google No, she didn't get a job. She got something that's probably a lot better. By Bill Murphy Jr. Bill Murphy Jr. is executive editor at TheMid.com and the founder of ProGhostwriters.com. Contact him at billmurphyjr.com. @BillMurphyJr Executive editor, TheMid.com, and founder, ProGhostwriters.com@BillMurphyJr WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Maybe you feel like you're stuck in a dead end job, or working at something that feels temporary at best, while you try to figure out what you really want in your professional life. Perhaps you worry that even if you did figure it out, you might not actually have the drive to go for it. Meet Chloe Bridgewater, a 7-year-old girl living in Hereford, England. She probably won't grow up to have that problem. Her dream job? Through her seven-year-old eyes, anyway, it's to work at Google. She saw some pics of the company's offices, "with their bean bags, go-karts, and slides," her father, Andy Bridgewater, wrote in a post on LinkedIn, and that was all she needed to decide it was the closest thing to getting paid to be a kid. Google Boss and Father Christmas With her dad's encouragement, Chloe wrote a letter to Google's CEO. Here's part of what it said (her dad shared it with Business Insider.) Dear Google Boss, My name is Chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with Google. I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics. ... My dad told me if I carry on being good and learning then one day may I will be able to have a job at Google. ... My dad told me to give you an application ... I don't really know what one of them is but he said a letter will do for now. Thank you for reading my letter, I have only ever sent one other and that was to Father Christmas. Good bye. Chloe Bridgewater, Age 7 Is there an opening for a vice-president of cuteness? Adorable, right? (As an aside, what's up with kids always announcing their ages? Just once, for the sheer fun of it, I'd like to receive a serious job application signed something like, "Howard McCarthy, Age 33.") But I digress. As the elder Bridgewater went on to describe in his LinkedIn post, Chloe's letter elicited a response from Google CEO Sunda Pichai. (You can see Pichai's letter here. Business Insider says they verified its authenticity.) Of course, it's short and sweet: "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school," Pichai wrote. Still, that little 6-line letter left his daughter "delighted" the elder Bridgewater wrote, and left her "even more eager to do well at school" (and to work for Google). What you can learn from a 7-year-old So, it's a cute story. But is it really unique? And if not, does it matter? Because I highly suspect that a decade and a half ago, kids were sending cute little letters like this to Microsoft, and 30 years ago they were writing to Jack Welch at GE. Seventy years ago they probably wrote to Henry Ford. The difference of course was that there was no social media for proud parents to show off their work to the world. But before you take a hard-hearted, cynical view of this story, consider the takeaways: First, it's never too early to start networking. In 10 or 15 years when Chloe Bridgewater is applying for her first "real job," she'll have a heck of an ice-breaker story. Second, you never know how much impact a small act of kindness will have. Kudos to Pichai for taking the few minutes the letter must have required. And finally, especially if you're stuck somewhere, trying to figure out what you really want out of life, remember this: If you never ask for what you want, you're not going to like the answer.

Bridgewater provided CNBC with the original letter, addressed to "google boss": Like a skilled job seeker, Chloe discusses her own qualifications ("I like computers") and explains why she believes she would be a good fit for the company. She even provides references: "My teachers tell my mum and dad that I am very good in class and am good at my spelling, reading, and my sums."

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here When the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) created a record by blasting 104 satellites into space on Wednesday it was not the only one entering the record books. With its remarkable feat ISRO helped a pioneering US-based startup, Planet, put 88 satellites in orbit- the largest satellite constellation ever, which would enable the company to image the entire planet daily. ISRO's achievement was so remarkable that it went largely unnoticed that Planet now has the capability to image every piece of land, every day. The satellites launched are small and lightweight, but the combined strength is much more than what your conventional military satellites can achieve. Planet's journey started in 2011 when it set the bold mission of imaging the entire Earth land area every day. Their internal calculation said it would take between 100-150 satellites to achieve this and it set about building it. The extraordinary effort involved miniaturizing the satellites, learning to produce them at scale, reducing cost to a fraction, building the world's second largest private network of ground stations; customizing an automated mission control system, creating the systems to process the vast amount of image that would be generated and developing a software that would allow its customers to make sense of the images. Today Planet operates 144 satellites in orbit. "We were convinced that armed with such data, humanity would be able to have a significant positive impact on many of the world's greatest challenges," said Planet, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Robbie Schingler in a statement. Schingler says next up is getting this data to its customers and to those who need it the most. Who needs the data? It has been an eventful 2017 for Planet. On February 3, the company announced it is acquiring Google's satellite arm Terra Bella, which included the SkySat constellation of satellites. On closing the deal Google will enter into a multi-year contract to purchase Earth-imaging data from Planet. Google has acquired Terra Bella about two years ago for as much as $500 million. We are in the midst of resurgence in the commercial space arena and companies like Google depend on satellites to power everything from its Maps to cloud services. Facebook, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Michelin, the list of corporate that depend on satellite imagery is long. From Mapping & Planning, Media, Energy & Exploration, Security, Defense & Intelligence, Insurance, Engineering & Construction, Civil Government, Forestry, Maritime and Agriculture sector, satellite imagery is vital and Planet has positioned itself in a unique position where it can image every part of earth's land mass. The nature of information that Planet can now provide is mindboggling. Planet calls its satellites 'Dove' and Schingler says, "It's taken a minor Apollo project to get here." For now Planet has the herculean task of processing terabytes of data every day. Here are some additional facts and figures regarding this launch: 1. The 88 Dove satellites (collectively known as "Flock 3p") rode aboard a PSLV rocket from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India. 2. This leads to two world records: a record for the most satellites ever launched on a single rocket; and a record for the largest private satellite constellation in history, totaling 149 satellites in all. 3. This is our 15th launch of Dove satellites and second aboard India's PSLV. The launch of Flock 3p comes off the successful launch of Flock 2p on the PSLV in June 2016. 4. After deployment, all 88 satellites will be autonomously commissioned in batches. We expect Flock 3p to enter normal imaging operations in about three months. 5. Each of the Flock 3p satellites-our 13th build-sports a 200 mbps downlink speed and is capable of collecting over 2 million km per day.

In New York City, all but one of the public golf courses stay open during the winter.CreditPhotograph by Ernst Wrba / Alamy A few years ago, a Google app on my phone offered to navigate me to “work.” I didn’t know what to make of that, because my office is in my house, so I clicked the tab and discovered that Google had deduced, based on how I spend my time during a typical week, that I must work at 10 Golf Course Road—the address of my golf club. Google must also think I get laid off every winter, because between early December and early April I hardly ever go to the club. I live up in the hills in western Connecticut, a hundred miles north of New York, and our course almost always shuts down within a week or two of Thanksgiving. That doesn’t mean I quit playing, however. My friends and I spend hours every winter searching the Web for open courses within plausible driving distance of where we live. Playing golf is the best way to survive the emotionally difficult period between one golf season and the next; it’s also a useful distraction when there are bigger things to worry about. John Updike, who was an avid golfer virtually his entire adult life, once described his regular weekend rounds as “islands of bliss”; I feel the same way. Occasionally, I’ve been lucky enough to take wintertime golf trips to places like Arizona, South Carolina, Florida, and New Zealand. Most years, though, I play closer to home. On January 1, 2009, two friends and I celebrated the New Year by spending two days on a golf course just outside of Atlantic City, which is a four-hour drive from our town. I wore two pairs of gloves, plus a knit cap on top of a baseball cap on top of a skier’s balaclava, and on both days the three of us were the only players on the course—a great old one, where the ShopRite L.P.G.A. Classic is held every spring. Most winters, we’re able to find real grass even closer to where we live—as I wrote in a New Yorker article in 2005. One Sunday last month, for example, twelve of us escaped lousy weather in Connecticut by driving to Pelham Bay Golf Course, in Pelham Bay Park, in the Bronx. Pelham is one of fourteen courses owned by New York City, and, like all but one of those courses, it stays open through the winter except when the ground is covered with snow. Playing the city’s courses during the summer can be frustrating, because, even though fourteen courses sounds like a lot to a non-golfer, it’s actually nowhere near enough for a city the size of New York. (It works out to more than thirty thousand residents per hole.) But the crowds thin out, sometimes by a lot, when the weather turns crummy. A few years ago, four of us played Pelham on a day when the temperature was so far below freezing that, when we went in to pay, the kid behind the counter in the golf shop told us that we couldn’t tee off yet because of a “frost delay.” But after ten or fifteen minutes he let us go. Pelham Bay was built in 1898, when golf in the United States was still almost brand-new. (America’s first public golf course—in Van Cortlandt Park, also in the Bronx—is just two years older.) Pelham is actually one of two courses in Pelham Bay Park: Split Rock Golf Course, on the other side of some railroad tracks, was added in 1934. Split Rock was built as part of a citywide project that was intended to create jobs during the Great Depression—and so was its clubhouse, which the two courses share. When my friends and I first played Pelham, a little more than a dozen years ago, that clubhouse was an unheated wreck, thanks to years of neglect by the Parks Department. Since then, the company that now operates both courses, on a twenty-year lease from the city, has spent millions restoring it to something very close to what it was in its Art Deco heyday—in part by removing floodlights that had been bolted to the hammered-bronze light fixtures hanging from the ceiling in the Club Room, replacing panes missing from the distinctive round windows up near the ceiling, getting rid of a drinking fountain in front of one of two basalt-and-marble fireplaces, and banishing rats. When even the Bronx has a snow problem, my friends and I sometimes have luck a little farther south, at Dyker Beach Golf Course, in Brooklyn. (Pelham and Dyker are just twenty miles apart, but they occupy different microclimates, since Dyker is closer to two major sources of snow-melting heat: the Atlantic Ocean and Manhattan.) We’ve played Dyker many times, including twice a couple of months after Hurricane Sandy, in early 2013. We had to avoid several enormous uprooted trees, which were encircled by police tape, but other than that the course was in terrific shape. Dyker was built in the late eighteen-nineties and reworked in 1935—part of the same citywide golf project that created Split Rock. Dyker is where Tiger Woods’s father, Earl, learned to play golf, in the early nineteen-seventies. (He was stationed at Fort Hamilton, across the street.) It’s also the home course of the Shore View Golf Club, a large men’s group that was founded in 1930 and has a charter from the city. A number of years ago, the Mob rubbed out somebody near the fourteenth green the night before Shore View’s annual Father’s Day tournament, and the cops said the course would have to stay closed all day. But Shore View’s tournament chairman, a retired customs agent, persuaded them that if they simply roped off the thirteenth and fourteen holes—two long par fours that Shore View guys grumble about anyway—the golfers wouldn’t interfere with their examination of the corpse. My friends and I have never had to play around a dead body, but if we ever came across one I’m pretty sure we’d keep playing, too. There’s no helping the poor guy at this point—and tomorrow it could snow. The only city golf course that doesn’t stay open all winter is the newest one, Trump Links at Ferry Point, which was built on top of a former landfill near the northern end of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. Ferry Point is the city’s “premium” public course; playing eighteen holes there on a weekend can cost more than two hundred dollars, which is several times the maximum in-season rate at Pelham, Split Rock, Dyker, or any other city course. Because Ferry Point is such a high-class operation—as you can tell when you grab a handful of souvenir plastic ball markers bearing Donald Trump’s coat-of-arms-like gold logo—golfers are not allowed to use pushcarts, which most of my friends and I use and which are common golf-bag conveyances on all the city’s other courses. In the summer of 2015, shortly after three friends and I had played Ferry Point, I asked Trump why he had imposed that ban. “They don’t look proper on a course like that,” he said. “You know, we’re doing a very high-level job, and we don’t want that to happen, and we don’t like the look of a pushcart,” he said. “We’re doing something special here. We’ve built something really special, to the highest levels, and everybody loves it.” Trump doesn’t own Ferry Point; like the company that manages Pelham Bay and Split Rock, he leases the course from the city, and although he was involved in the final stages of construction, he didn’t create it, despite what he sometimes suggests. Still, he has spelled “TRUMP LINKS” in enormous, permanent-looking letters on a grassy bank facing the bridge. “It is so amazing, and people are treating it with great respect, and it’s a phenomenal course, on top of everything,” he said. “It’s incredible. And, you know, the people on the Whitestone Bridge, they’re shouting down, ‘We love it! We love it!’ They love the sign. Everybody loves the sign, the grass sign. So we’ve had a lot of fun with it, actually. It’s been great, and it’s a great success.” It’s difficult to imagine people in cars on the Whitestone Bridge shouting loud enough to be heard half a mile away; maybe they’re like the people Trump saw cheering the fall of the World Trade Center. Ferry Point was designed by a golf architect in Jack Nicklaus’s firm. It plays like a windswept Scottish or Irish links course, which it closely resembles, and it has killer views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn skylines, of the cemetery where Charles Lindbergh tried to ransom his kidnapped son, and, especially, of the bridge, which from several angles seems to rise out of the course itself. It’s hidden under snow right now; but I won’t be going back to that one, in any weather, until the end of either the lease or the lessee. David Owen has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1991.

Marketers aren’t about to yank their ad budgets from YouTube, and most probably won’t stop working with these video creators who draw hard-to-reach teenage audiences. But ad buyers say they expect brands to ratchet up the scrutiny they place on YouTube, the influencers they work with, and the various middlemen involved in brokering deals in the social marketing ecosystem. This week, Walt Disney Co. severed ties with Felix Kjellberg, who goes by PewDiePie, and Google’s YouTube canceled his show after The Wall Street Journal revealed he made anti-Semitic jokes and showed Nazi imagery in his videos. While the second season of his show on YouTube’s subscription service was called off and his channel was pulled from its Google Preferred advertising program, Mr. Kjelberg can still post videos to his channel and ads can appear before them. “It looks like he went way over the line in an effort to be provocative,” said Eric Johnson, founder and president of the ad agency Ignited, whose clients have worked with PewDiePie in the past. “Now that big money is coming in and corporate parents are watching, you’ve got to be careful.” Mr. Johnson’s clients, including a mobile game tied to the “Walking Dead” franchise and the Universal Pictures film “As Above, So Below,” had work with Mr. Kjelberg, and he said the creator had been professional and easy to work with. And the campaigns he participated in performed well, which speaks to the power of the YouTube audience, Mr. Johnson said. (Forbes estimates that Mr. Kjelberg made $15 million in 2016). Even after the uproar over PewDiePie’s comments, Mr. Johnson said he doubted that marketers would abandon YouTube or the social influencer space altogether. It’s often easier and more cost effective to reach young consumers via web video stars than paying for pricey TV ads, he said. “There are thousands and thousands of people doing this and they’re getting an audience.” Rob Norman, GroupM’s chief digital officer, said that something like the PewDiePie incident was all but inevitable given the sheer number of platforms and potential endorsers available to brands these days. Marketers essentially have two choices, he said. Avoid digital influencers entirely, which will be increasingly difficult for brands looking to reach young people. Or, from the start, “recognize risks have increased and increase the precautions,” he said. “And from the minute they start [working with an influencer], have a plan for ‘what’s my walk-it-back strategy?’” That’s for marketers working directly with influencers. But, when marketers simply run ad campaigns directly through YouTube, they don’t always know where their ads are going to run. Mike Henry, chief executive at the YouTube analytics firm OpenSlate, estimated that a $100,000 ad buy using YouTube’s TrueView ads—the skippable pre-roll ads—will end up running across more than 250,000 different YouTube videos. That’s a lot to keep track of, and “the PewDiePie news is causing brands to think harder about exactly where their ads are running,” he said. Steve Carbone, chief digital and analytics officer at the ad buying agency Mediacom, said he’d like more ad-buying safeguards options from Google—and ideally he’d like to employ more third-party tech companies to monitor YouTube campaigns. “The ongoing challenge for YouTube is its ability to assure advertisers that its platform is, in fact, brand-safe,” he said. Could Google have done more to protect advertisers from the PewDiePie fiasco? For years, the company has employed technology that helps sniff out copyrighted material. But it can’t catch everything. “YouTube uses technology and policy enforcement processes to determine if a video is suitable for advertising,” said a YouTube spokeswoman. “We have stringent advertising guidelines, and work hard to prevent ads appearing against any video that is not appropriate for our advertising partners. When we become aware of ads that are being served against ineligible content we immediately take action to remove them.” Chad Gutstein, chief executive at Machinima, which manages multiple YouTube channels, said he believes that platforms like YouTube and Facebook are working on improving the ability of their technology to catch videos like this before advertisers are exposed. But it isn’t easy. The PewDiePie incident could actually help YouTube by giving marketers the impression that the platform is on its way to becoming more professional with more advertiser-friendly content favored, said Mike Bienstock, founder of Semaphore, an agency specializing in helping marketers connect with YouTube talent. “YouTube is growing up,” he said. “At the end of day, Google is the biggest ad-selling machine on earth. Anything that creates controversy they don’t want.” Write to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print CONTENT FROM OUR SPONSOR Deloitte CMO Insights and Analysis from Deloitte 2017 Banking and Securities Outlook Initial market reactions to the U.S. election results indicate rosier financial performance prospects for banks and capital markets firms in 2017.

According to Engadget, PewDiePie’s popular YouTube channel was also removed from “Google Preferred,” a premium advertising program for popular YouTubers. Swedish-born PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, has an estimated annual income of more than $12 million, and he’s only 27-years-old. With more than 53 million subscribers, PewDiePie’s YouTube channel is the most popular channel on the streaming service, and it has brought him several multi-million dollar deals with sponsors and studios. He is known for publishing videos of himself playing videos games, as well as running pranks and jokes. [Image by Chris Jackson/Getty Images] PewDiePie’s latest controversy started when Disney found out about nine recent videos in which PewDiePie included Nazi imagery and anti-Semitic jokes. According to Metro, One of the videos, since deleted, showed two men from Sri Lanka that were hired by PewDiePie on Fiverr. The two men, allegedly at PewDiePie’s request, were shown dancing and holding up a sign that said “Death To All Jews.” In another video originally posted on PewDiePie’s YouTube channel, the star was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat, and a Swastika was then shown, along with images of Hitler. In other subsequent videos, PewDiePie showed swastikas drawn by his fans, showed a clip from one of Hitler’s speeches, and played the Nazi Party anthem. Realizing these videos were controversial, on January 17, PewDiePie posted a video (since then deleted as well) in which he tried to defend his actions. “What I just think – and I believe strongly in – is that it is 2017 now. We’re going to have to start separating what is a joke, and what is actually problematic. Is a joke actually pure racism? Is something that would be considered a joke purely homophobic, or anti-Semitic and all these things? Context f***ing matters.” Shortly after publishing his “explanation” video, PewDiePie hired an actor to impersonate Jesus Christ and say “Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong.” Following these videos, Disney-owned Maker Studios announced today that they were dropping their joint venture with PewDiePie. As part of the now-cancelled deal, PewDiePie and Maker Studios were going to produce videos, mobiles apps and other merchandise together. In their statement, Maker Studios said that PewDiePie has “clearly gone too far,” and therefore they are ending their affiliation with him. Following Disney’s decision, PewDiePie’s YouTube series, Scare PewDiePie, has been canceled by Google. The show’s first season was produced by Maker Studios for YouTube Red, YouTube’s video subscription service. The show, with The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman serving as its executive producer, featured PewDiePie exploring sets created to mimic horror video games. On June 23, 2016, YouTube announced that the show would be getting a second season. Today, however, a YouTube spokesperson released a statement about the cancellation of the show. “We’ve decided to cancel the release of ‘Scare PewDiePie’ season 2 and we’re removing the PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred.” [Image by John Lamparski/Getty Images] At this point, no official comment was given by PewDiePie regarding these latest developments, but on February 12, the vlogger posted a statement on his Tumblr account, addressing the anti-Semitic accusations and claiming that he is in no way supporting hateful attitudes. “I was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online. I picked something that seemed absurd to me — That people on Fiverr would say anything for 5 dollars. “As laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people, to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups: No, I don’t support these people in any way.” With the removal of PewDiePie’s YouTube channel from Google’s premium advertising program, the cancellation of his show and the loss of his deal with Disney, the YouTuber’s reputation and business plans will surely take a major hit. It remains to be seen whether the popular young star can come back from this major blow.

Fascinated by her Kindle Fire tablet and robots, and totally taken by the idea of working somewhere with bean bag chairs, go-karts, and slides, Chloe decided to apply to Google for a job. Here is Chloe's letter, shared to Business Insider by her father, Andy: Super cute, right? Well, imagine her surprise and delight when she got a letter back from the CEO of Google himself, Sundar Pichai, who encouraged her to follow her dreams, adding "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :)" View As Photolist » Google CEO Sundar Pichai at IIT: 15 quotes you shouldn't miss 116 Google CEO Sundar Pichai at IIT: 15 quotes you shouldn't miss India-born Google CEO Sundar Pichai today visited his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur, West Bangal. This was Pichai's first visit to the IIT campus since he passed out 23 years ago. Pichai interacted with students and shared some interesting anecdotes about his student life; his favourite cricketer, actor and ideal; as well as shared insights into India's growth as a digital economy, startup culture in the country and much more. Here are 14 things you shouldn't miss from Pichai's interaction with students. I had my interview at Google on April Fool's day On Google interview: Was interviewed at Google on April Fool’s Day (April 1, 2004). Was asked about Gmail at the interview. Was offered ice-cream during the Google interview Pichai was offered ice-cream during the interview; the purpose was to tell that Google is a 'different workplace'. Academics is important but not everything When asked about the importance of education: Academics is important but not everything. Take risks, try different things, follow your passion. It is no longer a crime to fail in India Responding to the importance of success: Aim high enough to fail a few times. Entry to prestigious institutions important, but doesn’t guarantee success, so you need to enjoy what you doing. Loves watching Virat Kohli When asked about his favourite cricketer: I love watching cricket, love watching Tendulkar play. Watching Kohli through the last year has been incredible. Gavaskar used to be my favourite cricketer back in college. Job insecurity is common and natural On being asked about job insecurity: Pichai termed job insecurity as imposters syndrome. He said that it is natural to have it, when one is surrounded by good people. What keeps him going: The desire to build products for everyone When asked about his passion: What makes me keep going is the desire to build products that everyone can use. Favourite actors are Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone When asked about his favourite actors: Favourite actors are many, including Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone. His ideal during growing-up year: Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy When asked about his ideal during growing-up years: Was deeply influenced by Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy during his days at IIT. Big regret about life at IIT: Not participating enough in cultural activities About regret he has about life at IIT: Not participating enough in cultural activities and taking humanity subjects seriously. Got a C grade while at IIT On grades: Pichai said that he did get a C grade at IIT. As for my GPA, it was too embarrassing to admit in the first year and pretty good in the next years. Will send a request for Google doodle on IIT-Kharagpur to the concerned team When asked if he can have the Google doodle dedicated to IIT-Kharagpur for a day: Will send a mail to the team on this, but chances are very less that they will accept. Indian startups have changed the brain drain culture When asked about brain drain: Startups are changing the brain drain culture in India. Further added that startups in India are world-class. A good team is as important as the leader On the importance of leadership: Team work is very important. A leader is as good as his team. Best memories ever are from IIT campus days The best time of his life: My best memories are with my wingmates Take a look at the letter, shared in a viral LinkedIn post by Chloe's father Andy Bridgewater earlier this week : In that LinkedIn post, Andy Bridgewater writes that it's a much-needed confidence booster for Chloe, who was "knocked down" by a car years ago. Chloe's fascination with Google began recently, Bridgewater tells Business Insider, when she asked him where his ideal place to work would be. Currently, Bridgewater works in sales for a refrigeration system parts manufacturer. "And I said, 'oh, Google would be a nice place to work," owing to their world-famous perks and all of the cutting-edge work they do, he says. And so, when Chloe decided she wanted to work there too, her father encouraged her to apply and "get the ball rolling," he says. Now, with all the attention garnered from Pichai's personal response, it's only redoubled Chloe's drive to work for Google. Bridgewater says that his daughter now wants to go on TV and talk to the media and use that to find some way in to the Silicon Valley-based search company. He's largely resisted, wanting her to focus on her studies and develop her skills. Except now, the elder Bridgewater wants to brush up on his own technological skills to catch up with Chloe. "Sadly, I think I've got to up my game," Bridgewater says.

The search giant is looking to invest in Indian startups and is reportedly in talks with various entities, including various venture capital (VC) firms. In its report, GadgetsNow states that Google “is seeking to directly invest in or acquire companies in India that cater to whom it refers to as the next billion internet users.” The Economic Times’ sources tell them that Google is not interested in eCommerce and will, in fact, be looking at companies involved in cloud computing and cybersecurity. Google wants to get the “next billion” online and that would require investment in network infrastructure, financial service, healthcare, education and more. As it stands, India has a population of 1.3 billion, but it doesn’t have a billion internet users. The report points out that Google has acquired more than 70 companies globally since 2014, but is yet to acquire a company in India. Its domestic VC arm has invested around $15 million in companies in India. Google is very keen on tapping into India’s potential internet population, as is seen in its investments in RailWire, the Smart Cities programme and more. A number of education ventures are also in the works.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google Home and Amazon Echo might get support for voice calling It looks like Amazon and Google want their smart speakers to make and receive phone calls. According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, both the companies are planning to add voice calling functionality to Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers. The voice calling ability could be added on these smart speakers by the end of this year, added the report. Both the smart speakers have the ability to respond to voice commands hence the calling functionality has been one of the most requested feature by users. However, privacy concerns, telecom regulations, access to emergency services and user experience are some of the aspects the companies are thinking about. Both the Echo and the Home continuously record audio to enable AI responses. Hence, the companies are worried whether consumers want to speak on a device that is able to record conversations. The Amazon Echo speakers would store numbers that are dialed as well as the length of each call instead of the actual conversations. The Echo and Home would probably use voice over internet protocol tech (VoIP). It is tipped that these speakers might access a third-party VoIP system, such as Skype for the calling feature.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM One bot to rule them all? Not likely, with Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft virtual assistants by ethan baron No dominant player yet: Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all jostling for the biggest piece of the virtual assistant pie. — Bay Area News Group/TNS It's no wonder titans of tech are locked in an epic battle of the bots, racing furiously to produce the best virtual assistant.  Their respective help-bots – Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana – promise consumers one of the most valuable commodities in the world: free time.  Thanks to the sudden acceleration of artificial intelligence and advancements in speech recognition and big-data storage, the technology behind virtual assistants is rapidly spreading from phones to cars and homes, and the truly useful helper is approaching fast. The four giants are fighting for the biggest share of a market expected to grow to US$12bil (RM53.38bil) by 2024.  "There's a tremendous amount of promise for these agents to help and assist with many different tasks that we face every day," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. "The more the agent can help you with, the more value it holds."  The ultimate goal is our own personal genie in a bottle that awakens with a word or touch to liberate us from all our mundane tasks, organize our days and nights, and free us from the stress of lives that have become so terribly busy. But that's not going to happen quite yet.  Today, the aid these virtual assistants provide remains limited. Most users of Google Home and Amazon Echo devices – which host Assistant and Alexa, respectively – stream music, play audio books, and control smart-home devices, according to surveys by San Francisco analytics firm VoiceLabs.  Still, the virtual agent's foundation in AI means the more it learns about a user's preferences and behaviours, the better job it can do. So while experts predict a handful of firms will dominate in this field – most agree Apple, Google and Amazon will be major players, with Microsoft in a lesser role – they're split on whether consumers will be served best by one bot, or more.  "People want one assistant, they don't want two," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research in San Jose. "You want one assistant, to be very readily available wherever you are."  However, the various assistants will likely end up somewhat specialized in their expertise, with Google's Assistant, for example, excelling in providing knowledge and managing schedules, and Microsoft's Cortana leading on gaming, said VoiceLabs CEO Adam Marchick. In a few years, many people will use two or three different assistants, Marchick predicted.  The industry stands at a critical moment, because the first highly effective help-bot to get a foothold in a consumer's home, phone or car will likely stay, creating a barrier to competitors, Marchick said.  In order for a virtual helpmate to run your life, it needs to engage with the providers of all the services you rely on, from your calendar app to your Uber ride. Those providers must either partner with the company operating the assistant, or design their app to integrate with the assistant. So Spotify will stream music upon request via Alexa, and Honeywell's smart-home thermostat, via Assistant, will bump up the temperature 15 minutes before Grandma's expected arrival.  For providers, "if there is a competitive advantage to be gained, then absolutely they will do it," said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at market research firm Parks Associates.  For all the major players, virtual assistants provide important data that fuels the AI that powers and improves them, making both the assistants and the products they live in ever more marketable. For Amazon, Alexa is an enthusiastic purchasing agent for the e-commerce that drives the firm. For Google, Assistant is a turbocharged vacuum for the data the company collects to sell ads targeted directly at users.  Underlying the projected expansion of virtual assistants is the "voice first" approach to personal technology, said Brian Roemmele, a Los Angeles tech entrepreneur and expert in voice computing. Voice operation keeps hands free and it's faster, he noted, because speaking conveys information more quickly than typing.  So far, both Google and Amazon have focused largely on home-based assistants. Google's new Pixel phones host Assistant, but it has an uphill battle because Apple has far more phones equipped with Siri on the market, said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with San Jose market research firm Creative Strategies.  The popularity of Amazon's Echo and Alexa notwithstanding – the company has sold more than 8 million Echo devices since rolling them out in late 2014, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners – most people want their virtual assistant on their phones, Bajarin said.  "When you're driving, that's critical, or if your hands are busy," Bajarin said. "The phone will continue to dominate as the vehicle for delivering the virtual assistant."  Putting these robo-helpers into cars' onboard systems has become a priority for major firms, including Microsoft, which seeks to extend the reach of its PC-based Cortana through the "connected-vehicle" platform it announced this year.  In January, Nissan announced it would integrate Microsoft's platform into its cars. Siri already can be used in a car via a phone or Apple's CarPlay system, or in cars sold with Siri integration built in. Hyundai is bringing Alexa and Google's Assistant into some of its cars so, for example, an owner could start their car from their living room.  While building the supreme help-bot is clearly a priority for many major tech firms, experts say the software today lacks the knowledge base to take the next big leap: to enable virtual assistants that can predict our needs to serve us better.  "Some of it is just raw amounts of data and understanding about how the world works and what humans expect," Reticle's Rubin said.  Which companies rise to dominance depends both on the capability of their bots and the draw of the gadgets that house them.  "The story has not been written on what success is going to be in this space," Sappington said. — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Toshiba to delay chip business sale to next year: Kyodo China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Jaguar fuels in-car innovation with its latest app Toshiba shares tumble as bigger stake in chip unit likely up for sale Facebook shutters hundreds of Oculus VR demo stations at Best Buy stores Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Others Also Read Made to match an active lifestyle Places to go on a weekend Spanish giants to host coaching clinics at college in Negri Sembilan advertisement Latest News Carpool and save with GrabShare Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Carpool and save with GrabShare Stand up to cancer Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The company's AI assistant will soon be competing with Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Huawei has formed a team with over 100 engineers in Shenzhen, China which is currently in early stages of development for the new digital smart assistant, according to one of Bloomberg. Huawei’s digital assistant will be aimed at Chinese customers meaning it will communicate in Chinese languages. One of Bloomberg's sources claimed that Huawei will continue to work with Google and Amazon when it comes to providing other services to its phones internationally. The company's own assistant will mostly rival Apple’s Siri on iPhones as most of Google’s services in China are blocked off despite majority smartphone users  are using Android OS. Related Stories Apple iPhone 8 To Face Tough Android Competitors This Year Huawei Watch 2 To Launch At MWC 2017 Although Huawei intends to continue working with Google, the company’s endeavor to build its own AI assistant clashes with Google’s plan in convincing other manufacturers to pre-install its own assistant on their devices. Currently, Google Assistant is only available on the Pixel phones, Google Home and Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches. As for Huawei’s commitment with Amazon, the Chinese phone maker previously just released its Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S. last month and it comes with Alexa already pre-installed. The Huawei Mate 9 first launch in China and other Asian markets back in November 2016. Huawei new digital assistant for its smartphones in China will be the company’s second investment in artificial intelligence. Back in October, the company announced that it plans to fund UC Berkeley in a partnership to research deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision, according to TechCrunch. Huawei has proven to be quite ambitious with its future plans. One of he company’s top executives, Richard Yu, stated last month during CES 2017 that Huawei wants to be the number one smartphone manufacturer by 2021.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach When the HDR modes of Apple iPhone 7, Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S7 were put to test, they produced different results. It will be wrong to suggest which one has the best camera as it depend entirely on personal choice. Here, the differences between the cameras, focusing more on HDR, have been put forth. In HDR mode, all three takes brilliant photos where iPhone 7 tries more to keep the natural look in its images, even when the image is darker than expected. iOS’ advanced photo-editing software is a bonus to make the darkened spots pop out. According to PhoneArena, the Google Pixel’s HDR mode successfully balances light and shadow and produces some really impressive photos. However, at times, some of the images are heavily doctored and may look cartoonish despite simple photo edits. Samsung Galaxy S7’s HDR mode favours boosting the brightness of images, including the bright spots. At times, it sacrifices finer details to produce well-lit images. While this is a bonus for many, some professional photographers may not want to sacrifice details in favour of brightness. According to GSMArena, the Apple iPhone 7 has a 12MP primary camera with f/1.8, 28mm, phase detection autofocus, OIS and quad-LED (dual tone) flash. Other features include 1/3" sensor size, geo-tagging, simultaneous 4K video and 8MP image recording, touch focus, face/smile detection and HDR (photo/panorama). The camera supports videos at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps and 720p@240fps. The secondary camera is of 7MP with f/2.2, 32mm, 1080p@30fps, 720p@240fps, face detection, HDR and panorama. The Google Pixel primary camera is of 12.3MP with f/2.0, EIS (gyro), phase detection & laser autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Other features include 1/2.3" sensor size, 1.55µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama. It supports videos at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps and 720p@240fps. The secondary camera is of 8MP and comes with f/2.4, 1/3.2" sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size and 1080p video recording. The Samsung Galaxy S7 primary camera is of 12MP with f/1.7, 26mm, phase detection autofocus, OIS and LED flash. Galaxy S7’s features include 1/2.5" sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size, geo-tagging, simultaneous 4K video and 9MP image recording, touch focus, face/smile detection, Auto HDR and panorama. Videos are recorded at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps, 720p@240fps, HDR and dual-video rec.

Looming privacy concerns associated with the functionality is reportedly stalling development, however.  ( Amazon ) Advertisement Google and Amazon's respective smart speakers could soon gain another functionality: placing and receiving phone calls. The feature could arrive on both Amazon Echo and Google Home later this year, a new report by the Wall Street Journal suggests. You Might Soon Place Calls Via Echo Or Home Both companies are pursuing to activate the feature, but those attempts have been hampered by privacy and regulatory concerns, the report states, citing sources privy to the matter. Amazon has been apparently developing a voice call feature for Echo since 2015, but such efforts have been held up by "employee turnover." How Would This Work? How voice calling would function for both smart speakers remains unclear, but the report suggest that the devices would most likely take advantage of voice over internet protocol, or VoIP, a technology which facilitates calls over the internet, used by Skype and other messaging apps with calls and conferencing functionality. Amazon is considering other options beyond VoIP, however, such as providing individual Echo devices their own unique phone numbers and using call forwarding or synchronising the Echo owner's preexisting mobile number to the device itself, the report suggests. Google Is More Experienced Than Amazon In This Sphere Whoever gets there first matters not to Google, who has considerably more experience in the field, having operated Google Voice since 2009. The service provides users their own phone number, which can be used for call forwarding and VoIP calls. Google Voice's user interface has recently gained significant tune-ups. Additionally, Google also maintains wireless service Project Fi, which siphons off mobile data from a number of carriers, switching between them according to signal strength and speed to ensure consistent user connectivity. Privacy Concerns Loom As Business Insider notes, enabling phone calls is a logical trajectory both smart speakers are likely to take, given that both devices are increasingly finding their way onto people's homes of late, becoming smarter and more popular each time. But the notion of phone calls would likely agitate privacy concerns already associated with the system, especially since it can record conversations. Apart from that, there's also telecom regulation, access to emergency services, and the overall user experience are some of the few things that are likely being put into consideration. Citing a source, the report suggests that Amazon wouldn't record the content of the actual conversations — just the call duration and what numbers are dialed. All aforementioned considerations told, coupled with regulatory roadblocks that will potentially stall approval of such a system, it seems that Google and Amazon might still be miles away from the finish line. Suppose that both find a way to make it work, however, then Google and Amazon may very well soon replace traditional landline home phones. At present, AT&T already offers a skill for Echo's Alexa virtual assistant that lets users send text messages via voice commands using the speaker. Expanding that relationship to include calls can come as an evolution of that functionality. Would you like an Amazon Echo or Google Home that can make and receive calls?

This information comes from a new report allegedly originating with "people familiar with the matter". They say that by the end of this year, both Google's and Amazon's speakers could have support for voice calls. So you'll be able to say "call Mark" and that would happen. It's conceivable that the speakers will also ring when someone calls, but it's unclear if that functionality will actually be baked in too. What's more, there's no mention on how this will work - will your cell number somehow be paired with your speaker? Will your speaker get a phone number of its own? What's more, the requirement for access to emergency services is slowing down the potential rollout it seems. There's also privacy to worry about, as well as some ancient telecom regulations. So despite the fact that the technology to make this work is mostly in place, it may take a while for the feature to make its debut.

The talks, between KACST President Prince Dr. Turki bin Saud bin Mohammed Al-Saud, and Kent Walker, Google senior vice president for public policy affairs and social investment, were held at the KACST headquarters in Riyadh. The visiting delegation included Sam Baltteis, chief of government affairs of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and Selim Edde, Google head for public policy in the Middle East and North Africa. Hassan Al-Duhaim, managing director of the Saudi Arabian Investment Authority (SAGIA), was also present. Welcoming the Google delegation, Prince Turki outlined KACST activities in science, research, innovation, IT and communication, in line with Saudi Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program (NTP) 2020. He said the KACST will help the government and non-governmental organizations diversify their projects and investments, and help Saudi youth in innovation, science, technology and research. Prince Turki also highlighted KACST efforts in enriching Arabic content on the Internet via a program initiated by King Salman. Walker expressed his desire to cooperate with the KACST in future projects that service their mutual objectives and Arab users in science and technology. The visiting delegation held a meeting with KACST IT specialists and reviewed research proposals conducted by the KACST with other stakeholders in IT. These include the King Abdullah Initiative for Digital Content, which with the support of King Salman serves to foster the presence of the Arabic language in mass-communication platforms, as well as in science and technology. The Kingdom spent SR120 billion ($32 billion) on developing the telecommunication and IT sectors in 2015. Saudi Arabia is the largest such investor in the region, and among the top 10 globally.

The code would effectively eliminate the presence of links to copyright infringing material in search. According to a report by TorrentFreak, all parties have agreed the code should come into effect by June 1, 2017. This decision was prompted by roundtable discussions led by the UK’s Intellectual Property Office. Despite Google’s best efforts to remove links to copyright infringing content, the entertainment industry believes the search giant should do more. Google, in conjunction with representatives from the entertainment industry, are said to be extremely close to finalizing an agreement on what should be done. Baroness Buscombe states: “While there are still elements of detail to be settled, the group is now agreed on the key content of the code and I expect an agreement to be reached very soon.” Google voluntarily agreeing to introduce such a code to its search results will prevent the UK government from forcing the company to do so. The Baroness continues: “The search engines involved in this work have been very co-operative, making changes to their algorithms and processes, but also working bilaterally with creative industry representatives to explore the options for new interventions, and how existing processes might be streamlined.” It is said the UK-based agreement to implement an anti-piracy code will likely put pressure on Google to do the same in the United States as well.

A team of more than a hundred engineers is in the early stages of developing the technology at its Shenzhen, China offices, one of the people said. The efforts are extensive and are aimed at Apple Inc’s Siri, Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa, and Alphabet Inc’s Google Assistant, not smaller players, the person said. Huawei’s assistant would communicate in Chinese languages and target domestic users while the company will continue to work with Google and Amazon’s Alexa service outside China, a one of the other people said. They asked not to be identified as the details are private. Building its own answer to Siri may help Huawei devices stand out in a crowded Chinese market, where many Google services that come with the dominant Android smartphone operating system are blocked. Huawei is targeting US$33 billion (RM147 billion) in sales from its consumer business this year. The company trails only Apple and Samsung Electronics Co in global smartphone shipments as it pushes upmarket with premium features. Having a major Android device manufacturer choose to build a voice assistant in-house may throw another wrench in Google’s plans. Huawei last month announced it would use Alexa on its Mate 9 smartphones in the US. Currently, the Google Assistant only runs on Google’s Pixel smartphone, Home speaker and smartwatches running the latest version of the Android Wear software. The largest online search company is trying to get third-party device makers to pre-install its assistant, according to people familiar with the talks. Spokespeople for Huawei and Google declined to comment. Huawei is not the first Android device manufacturer to develop its own service over using Google’s. Samsung acquired Viv Labs last year, a startup formed by some Siri founders, to serve as the basis for its own voice assistant. Samsung plans to release the first devices with this new technology later this year. Chinese search giant Baidu Inc announced its own voice service in 2015. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Pokemon Go’ adds more than 80 new pocket monsters this week (VIDEO) Huawei said to plan own voice assistant for smartphones New Facebook job-hunting features challenge LinkedIn Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods BusyKid turns chores into child's play Focus on Vivo: Chinese smartphone maker known for audio quality, selfies Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Algorithms: The managers of our digital lives Sony's new 4K Ultra HD TVs, Blu-ray player hit stores in March Apple TV eyes Amazon Fire TV's success Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Related Articles Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple Apple joins group devoted to keeping AI nice From Alexa to virtual reality: Highlights of CES 2017 Amazon Alexa virtual assistant shines at CES 2017 Google pushes virtual reality harder with new phones from partners Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

By Zack Whittaker for London Calling | July 2, 2012 -- 17:56 GMT (10:56 PDT) | Topic: Google Search behemoth Google offered on Monday to settle an ongoing European antitrust investigation in a bid to prevent it from being served with huge fines and restrictions on its business practices in Europe. Google chairman Eric Schmidt has sent a letter to E.U. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, according to a Commission spokesperson, in which Schmidt offered a deal which could prevent a fully-fledged antitrust investigation. The letter addressed the "four areas the European Commission described" last month --- which can be found here. The details of the letter were not open for disclosure, but a spokesperson said it "will now analyse its content." A Google spokesperson confirmed to ZDNet the search giant had made a "proposal" to address the European Commission's concerns, and will "continue to work co-operatively with the Commission." Almunia said in May during a midday briefing that the Commission had asked Google to "make concessions" and offer a settlement bid to prevent an all-out antitrust investigation. If Google failed to adjust its business practices, a formal antitrust complaint would be sent to the company. Back in 2010, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic began investigating the company based on claims from rival firms that Google was discriminating them in the online advertising space. Not limited to Europe, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission also began an investigation, while Argentinian and South Korean authorities are also looking into how Google operates with an eye on the possibility of drawing up charges.  If Google concedes defeat and the European Commission allows Google to successfully settle, it's an admission of guilt. However, it does mean that Google would avoid an actual "guilty" verdict, which could cause business-restricting headaches for the company.  Should the settlement offer fail, Google would face a fine up to $3.8 billion --- a maximum of 10 percent of its $37.9 billion global revenue last year.  Update (12:05 p.m.): added remarks from a Commission spokesperson.

By Zack Whittaker for London Calling | July 10, 2012 -- 16:42 GMT (09:42 PDT) | Topic: Google France's data protection agency said it is looking to wrap up the inquiry over Google's privacy policy merger and will likely give its verdict in September, reports Reuters. Google remains at the centre of a privacy storm that saw European regulators riled and demanding answers as to why it combined some 70 privacy policies from its products and services and smashed them into a one-size-fits-all document. The search giant said it warned users of the changes for months in the run up to the March 1 switchover in form of emails and search page notifications, which it says it designed to improve search results better. Users cannot opt out of the new data-sharing policy. The 'simplified' privacy policy shares private user data from one Google product to another, making targeted advertising more focused and the collection of data by government agencies far easier. Simply put, it allows Google to build up an even greater, succinct picture of its users.  The Article 29 Working Party asked Google to put the changes on ice until it could consider the impact it would have on European citizens, but the company ignored the warning and went ahead on its scheduled date. The French Commission Nationale de l'Informatique (CNIL) said it planned to make it decision in June on whether Google's move complied with European law, but an influx of documents and paperwork from the search giant delayed the decision.  The CNIL, which was tasked with probing the regulator with the long arm of the law, will draw its conclusions and present its findings to the European Union's other data regulators later this year. The inquiry could lead to a slap on the bottom for Google in form of a fine up to €300,000 ($370,000; £240,000) and sanctions against the company's business practices within the EU --- something it would want to avoid.  However, individual member states could seek their own financial penalties, which could see the fines rack up into the millions of euros.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Huawei Reportedly Planning Their Own Voice Assistant For Smartphones By Tyler Lee on 02/15/2017 18:18 PST In the voice assistant market, Apple has Siri, Google has Google Assistant, Microsoft has Cortana. There are also voice assistants that aren’t natively integrated into phones or computers, such as SoundHound’s Hound and Amazon’s Alexa. We have also heard that Samsung is planning their own voice assistant called “Bixby”. This is why it doesn’t really come as a complete surprise to learn that Huawei could be working on their own voice assistant platform as well. This comes from a report from Bloomberg in which people familiar with the matter told the publication about Huawei’s plans. According to the report, Huawei has a team of more than 100 engineers who are in the early stages of developing the technology at their Shenzhen offices in China. This is particularly interesting because last we heard, Huawei was expected to bundle Amazon’s Alexa into its smartphones, so for Huawei to turn to their own platform would suggest that maybe Alexa could be a temporary measure until their own AI is up to scratch. However according to the report, Huawei’s voice assistant is meant more for the Chinese market and will communicate in Chinese. The company is expected to continue working with Google and Amazon for devices that are sold outside of China. Take it with a grain of salt for now, but it wouldn’t be a stretch to think that companies are seeing the benefits of having their own voice assistant as opposed to having to rely on third-party software, but whether or not Huawei’s efforts will be successful remains to be seen.

These include the King Abdullah Initiative for Digital Content, which with the support of King Salman serves to foster the presence of the Arabic language in mass-communication platforms, as well as in science and technology. The Kingdom spent SR120 billion ($32 billion) on developing the telecommunication and IT sectors in 2015. Saudi Arabia is the largest such investor in the region, and among the top 10 globally.

That is just a few of the awesome things you did not know you could use Google to do. With the help of Jumia Travel, we unravel the mystery and reveal six things you did not know you could use Google to do. Set a timer You can use Google to set a timer. Simply Google the amount of time you want to set and include the word ‘timer’ at the end. A countdown will come up and you can set it to make a sound when the set time has elapsed. Split a bill On a night out with a group of friends, you have all ordered your meals and eaten to your hearts’ content. Now it is time to pay the bill. Rather than struggle to calculate the amount each person is going to pay, you can simply Google ‘tip calculator’. You enter the cost of the bill and the number of people to pay for it. It will give you the cost for each person. If you want to add a tip for the waiter to the cost, you can include the percentage of the tip you want to give or you can just set the ‘tip %’ at ‘0%’ if you do not want to give a tip. Filter your Gmail Especially when using your Gmail to register or sign up to certain websites, you can add “+anything” to your email address; this will create a folder that all emails from that site will go to automatically. This will help you keep your Gmail in order and avoid irrelevant emails mixing up with the relevant ones. The format for this is your [email protected] e.g.david.michael+kamdora@ gmail.com. Find and download fonts Simply use this link ‘https://fonts.google.com/’or Google ‘Google fonts’ to access and download the large collection of free fonts Google has to offer. Plan your wedding Yes, Google can help you plan your wedding. You can either use this link “https://drive.google.com/ previewtemplate?id= 0AhN0y99GtIFTdEc0ZzFkMU8tZmFTS Vp3dmhhMlRycWc&&ddrp=1#” to access the all-in-one wedding planner, or Google ‘Google Weddings’ and follow the result with the heading “Wedding: All-in-One Wedding Planner.” Google Weddings helps you do everything from announcing the news of the wedding engagement to finding a venue, making a budget, creating the guest list, creating the schedule etc. Find out the week’s football fixtures All you need to do is Google the football league and a chart will come up showing the different teams in the league that have played alongside their scores, and the teams to play in the coming weeks along with the times they are to play. For example, if you Google ‘EPL’, a chart with all the scores and schedules for the teams to play in that league will come up. The chart shows you the scores and game schedules for all the teams in that league. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Q. Is it possible to talk with Siri on non-Apple devices? The short answer is no, Siri is a feature only available from Apple. It is the voice-controlled Intelligent Personal Assistant installed on Apple devices. Controlling devices with voice commands are hot right now, and Apple Siri has plenty of company. Microsoft has Cortana. Google has Google Voice. Samsung has Viv. Amazon has Alexa. Each has a common set of abilities, along with capabilities unique to that assistant. For example, any of them can tell you the weather, but only Siri can play content on AppleTV, and only Alexa can order products from Amazon. There is also a wide variety of devices to support these assistants. In addition to laptops, tablets, and phones, a new category of desktop device has appeared in the last year. The only one so far to get much traction is Amazon Echo, which is a line of devices ranging from $50 to $150. We are still in the early-adopter stage of desktop voice assistants, but there is an abundance of interesting developments to explore. Note that while Siri is Apple-only, most of the other assistants are available on multiple models via an app. Q. I have a small room inside my house where the light switch is in an inconvenient place. I have to awkwardly fumble around to reach it. Can home automation help? Because you mentioned “home automation,” I need to start with a warning. Home automation is a loosely defined term that includes a mix of products and services. Many of them show great promise, but they are not fully baked yet. There are incompatible standards, a device from company A is unlikely to work with a device from company B. Some vendors have gone out of business, stranding users. Often a device will solve one problem only to create two new problems. I will write about home automation in the coming months, but at the moment, my advice is to steer clear. Wait until the products mature. Now back to your light switch. When I was very young, my grandmother fell down the cellar steps because the switch inside the cellar door was in an odd place. Fortunately, she escaped with only a few bruises. It may seem like overkill for some, but I think switch placement is about safety as much as convenience, especially in homes built before modern electrical codes. I had a similar safety issue in my garage, and I solved it with the help of a licensed electrician and a wall switch with a built-in occupancy sensor. These switches sense movement in the room and turn on the power when needed. Better models include two sensors, one for motion and one for ambient light, so the light only turns on when the room is both occupied and dark. In the right situation, sensor switches are a worthwhile investment. Q. My phone’s battery no long-er lasts an entire day. The battery seems to go from 20% to empty very quickly. What can I do besides replace the phone? Try restarting the phone. A simple off-on cycle never hurts and often helps. If the problem remains, the next step is to look for an app that consumes too much power. Newer phones have a Battery Setting screen that lists which apps use the most power. With this information, you may be able to put your phone’s power consumption on a diet. When these software fixes do not work, it is time to look at hardware. Is the phone still under warranty? If the phone is old enough to be out of warranty, the battery is probably near the end of its life. Generally when a battery ages, the battery meter becomes less dependable. There are apps that reveal a phone’s battery cycle count, which is a good indicator to determine if the battery has developed a fault, or has merely been used up . If you work though the steps above and still do not have enough power, the solution is to add a bigger battery. Mophie (mophie.com) makes a line of “Juice Pack” phone cases that incorporate a battery. They come in different sizes, everything from small enough to add just a few hours to very large multi-day workhorses. A good battery case will add a few hours of usability each day, and it will add many months to the overall lifetime of the phone itself.

It's a little early to pen a full review, so instead I offer five things I learned after wearing the LG Watch Sport for a weekend. A giant watch Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Pictures of the LG Watch Sport don't tell the full story of just how big this watch looks and feels. It's not the diameter of the watch that's shocking, it's how thick it is. The bulk is likely to make room for LTE radios and added battery life for the extra connectivity. Speaking of battery life, my experience has been mixed so far. With LTE enabled, I'm able to get through a day of use, but not more. I'll keep testing and include a more in-depth report on battery life in an full review soon. Do I spin or swipe? Jason Cipriani/ZDNet The Watch Sport has three buttons on the right side. Two are dedicated app shortcuts you can customize, while the middle button does all sorts of things. A quick press opens the app list. A long-press activates Google Assistant. Within an app, the button takes you to the home screen. The Internet of Things 10 types of enterprise deployments As businesses continue to experiment with the Internet of Things, interesting use cases are emerging. Here are some of the most common ways IoT is deployed in the enterprise. Read More Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 This same button also rotates, making it easy to scroll through whatever information is on the screen. For example, when viewing your watch face, you can start scrolling up to view pending alerts, and then tap on a notification to view more information. Implementing a digital crown on Android Wear is a welcomed addition, instead of forcing users to swipe multiple times on a watch screen while simultaneously trying to view content on the display. It's also a feature that's not used in every app across the board -- and it's incredibly frustrating. Within several apps, where content goes below the screen and scrolling is required, it's hit or miss whether you can use the crown to scroll or if you need to swipe. In the Android Pay app, for example, you cannot use the crown to scroll. In the Google Fit app, you can use the crown to scroll up or down. The inconsistent experience makes no sense. Android Wear 2.0 doesn't feel finished Never knowing when to swipe or use the crown is just one example of Android Wear 2.0's hit-or-miss experience. The entire operating system feels as if it needs more polish, even after it was delayed for several months. Google Assistant, a key feature of the update, doesn't always launch, often begging for a data connection despite being connected to Wi-Fi, LTE, and my phone. Switching watch faces sometimes results in no watch face being displayed at all -- just a blank, black screen -- until you restart the watch. Android Pay Unfortunately, I can't test Android Wear's new Android Pay integration. According to the official list of cards supported by Android Pay, there are two providers who don't support Android Wear quite yet: Citi and Wells Fargo. As luck would have it, those happen to be the two cards I can add. NumberSync is confusing The LG Watch Sport is the first LTE watch I've used. I was excited about the prospect of leaving my phone at home when running errands or going for a walk thanks to AT&T's NumberSync feature. After adding the watch to my AT&T account for $10 a month, I attempted to activate NumberSync, with the Sport paired to Google's Pixel XL. The process takes a few minutes. It requires you to enter a sync code on the AT&T website to verify the watch and connect it to your phone number. However, after entering the sync code, I was greeted with an error message stating the phone I was using lacked support for HD Voice. Therefore, I can't use NumberSync. Bummer. Knowing my iPhone 7 Plus supports HD Voice, I reset the watch and paired it to my iPhone. NumberSync set up worked, and messages sent to my phone were delivered to the watch even with my iPhone turned off. Unfortunately, when my phone was turned on and connected to the watch, I would receive text message alerts twice. Once as a standard notification on the watch, then again as a standalone message sent just to the watch. After tinkering with settings, duplicate notifications still persisted. I need to look into it more, but as of right now, I have NumberSync disabled. Hopefully I was missing something and adjusting a setting or two is all that's needed to stop double delivery of text messages. While I continue to work on my review, make sure to read through Matthew Miller's story detailing why he thinks the Gear S3 is better than the Watch Sport.

Shares The HTC Vive is, to this day, the best way to experience virtual reality. One of its few downsides is that you’re required to pair it with a fairly powerful PC. But as HTC wants to push its master stroke VR chops into its mobile business, you can bet that we’ll see new Vive hardware in the future that relies on smartphone hardware to power the experience. What will it be called? What will it look like? How much will it cost? Let’s dive right in. Cut to the chase What is it? A mobile-friendly take on the HTC Vive When is it out? Possibly within the next few months How much will it cost? Likely a fraction of the PC-tethered Vive The idea of an HTC Vive headset that’s tuned for use with a smartphone has been on a slow, but steady boil since MWC 2016 when HTC stated that “it would make sense” for it to investigate such a thing. While Samsung has sailed into its second generation, but still largely unchanged Samsung Gear VR, and Google has introduced its Google Daydream platform, it is a bit odd that HTC has abstained from the fray. But HTC’s CFO Chia-Lin Chang said that the company is close to releasing something that will feed from the power of the HTC U Ultra, according to a recent interview. However, unlike the competition, the company will be taking a different approach instead of the common “phone slapped into a headset” as he put it rather frankly. While that tease trims away some of the possibilities as to how this HTC Vive made for mobile will receive its power, it leaves more than enough blanks for us to fill. Here’s what we want to see in HTC’s first mobile VR headset. Inside-out tracking Today’s mobile-driven VR headsets don’t offer much in the way of tracking anything other than your current X and Y axis thanks to the gyroscope and accelerometer inside of your phone. Tethered headsets, like the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and PSVR benefit from some added external hardware that allows what’s called outside-in tracking. Whether it be a camera or a set of lighthouses, the extra hardware allows spatial information to be collected, allowing it to track your head and controller movement in three dimensions. Basically, it helps to add immersion. The inverse of this is inside-out tracking, which puts that head-tracking tech inside of the headset. The Microsoft HoloLens is a good example of this in action, but we’d love to see the HTC Vive mobile headset come packing a similar setup of internal sensors.  Native Daydream support As much as we want to see HTC forge its own path in the mobile VR world, we also would like Google Daydream support for the headset. Given that this headset will connect to the HTC U Ultra in some fashion, the phone runs on Android Nougat out of the box, which means that it will be primed from the start to support Google’s high-quality VR platform. Taken a step further, it’s entirely plausible that the phone could work in a similar manner to the HTC Vive’s controllers, albeit without buttons. To remedy this, HTC could launch a face plate for the phone that applies capacitive buttons, making it compatible with any experiences already available through the Google Play Store. Two hours of use As novel and convenient as mobile VR may be, one of its inherent flaws is that it’s running entirely off a battery. And given that VR is such an intensive task, it puts an especially quick drain on most smartphone batteries, even if they are quite large. The HTC U Ultra stocks a respectable, but not-all-that-impressive 3,000mAh internal battery. While this is certainly enough to keep things running for at the very least an hour, it’s hard to tell how much longer it could feasibly last. Considering that VR backpacks, like the Zotac VR Go can run for about two hours, we hope that HTC has something up its sleeves that can squeeze out at least that much performance. Maybe we’ll see a little battery juice built inside of the headset to let the good times roll a little bit longer. Low price point HTC’s upcoming efforts could fall somewhere in the $199-299 price region, which already seems high considering that you apparently need to own the HTC Ultra U to operate it at all. This is but a fraction of the HTC Vive rather prohibitive cost at $799 / £689 / €899, as a mobile VR headset obviously doesn’t stand a chance at that price. It’s difficult to pin down what price will be acceptable for what HTC is creating since so little is known about it. However, if it arrives as the first of its kind: a highly capable mobile VR headset that’s stocked with inside-out tracking potential and unique software experiences, a higher price would be expected to follow. More processing power The reason that the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift are the preferred avenues with which to experience VR is all thanks to the loads of power coming through from a PC. But considering the fast evolution of smartphone chipsets, it’s certainly amazing what they can do today, though they don’t hold a candle by comparison. The throughput potential of the HTC Ultra U is likely to be at least as good as the Google Pixel since it features 4GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 821. However, these specs are a bit worrying for the headset as it will likely be outmatched by the Snapdragon 835, the chipset strongly rumored to be featured first in the Samsung Galaxy S8. To really impress with its mobile Vive, HTC would ideally install a processing unit of sorts into the headset, much like how the PSVR works with the PS4. Working in tandem with the phone, it’s easy to imagine that HTC’s headset would handily outperform what we’ve seen in the mobile VR space thus far. Comfort and function balanced Anyone who has tried the HTC Vive can probably agree that it’s among the most comfortable headsets out there. What’s better than its comfort is that it lets very little light inside, which is a common problem encountered with the Google Daydream View. Form and function is an even more delicate balance to strike when it comes to VR headsets and thankfully, HTC knows a thing or two about it already. Hopefully, the company applies its learnings to the mobile VR space as well. AR functionality Augmented reality is potentially on the brink of a major breakthrough. And thanks to Google’s own Tango software, the mixed reality technology is easier to access and develop for than ever. We have our doubts that the HTC Ultra U alone could provide a super-smooth AR experience, but if this headset had a little processing power of its own, this idea becomes way more feasible. It’s worth noting that including such a feature would also rely on HTC keeping the cameras that are on the Vive and tuning them to support spatial detection. This wish seems like the least likely to happen on our list, but fingers are still crossed as it would put this headset way ahead of the rest. Steam VR support HTC’s Vive and Steam are practically synonymous thanks to their partnership to get Steam VR off the ground. As Valve’s first partner for the platform, it’s entirely possible that we’ll see another company taking on the next headset. But until that happens, it’d break new ground for Valve to introduce some sort of cross-platform functionality for Vive compatible apps and games on Steam to also work on this mobile VR headset. Again, the likelihood here is slim given how large of a leap it would be for Valve. But a move like this would massively benefit both HTC and Valve. It’s possible that HTC could have something to introduce as early as MWC 2017. In that case, we’ll be sure to be among the first to try it out and report back. What do you think HTC’s mobile VR headset will be like? Have we missed anything? Let us know in the comments.

A 7-Year-Old Girl Asked Google For A Job - And CEO Sundar Pichai Responded Matt Weinberger Feb 16, 2017, 12:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories children community management job seeking managers Share Image: iStock Chloe Bridgewater, who lives in Hereford, UK, has a little more drive than your average seven-year-old. Fascinated by her Kindle Fire tablet and robots, and totally taken by the idea of working somewhere with bean bag chairs, go-karts, and slides, Chloe decided to apply to Google for a job. Here is Chloe’s letter, shared to Business Insider by her father, Andy: Super cute, right? Well, imagine her surprise and delight when she got a letter back from the CEO of Google himself, Sundar Pichai, who encouraged her to follow her dreams, adding “I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :)” Take a look at the letter, shared in a viral LinkedIn post by Chloe’s father Andy Bridgewater earlier this week: Business Insider has confirmed the veracity of the letter. In that LinkedIn post, Andy Bridgewater writes that it’s a much-needed confidence booster for Chloe, who was “knocked down” by a car years ago. Chloe’s fascination with Google began recently, Bridgewater tells Business Insider, when she asked him where his ideal place to work would be. Currently, Bridgewater works in sales for a refrigeration system parts manufacturer. “And I said, ‘oh, Google would be a nice place to work,” owing to their world-famous perks and all of the cutting-edge work they do, he says. And so, when Chloe decided she wanted to work there too, her father encouraged her to apply and “get the ball rolling,” he says. Now, with all the attention garnered from Pichai’s personal response, it’s only redoubled Chloe’s drive to work for Google. Bridgewater says that his daughter now wants to go on TV and talk to the media and use that to find some way in to the Silicon Valley-based search company. He’s largely resisted, wanting her to focus on her studies and develop her skills. Except now, the elder Bridgewater wants to brush up on his own technological skills to catch up with Chloe. “Sadly, I think I’ve got to up my game,” Bridgewater says.

McCray, who has been serving as CEO of Aero Communications and on the board of CenturyLink, takes over in the role previously held by Craig Barratt, who has since resigned that post and was recently named CEO of Barefoot Networks, a maker of fast, programmable Ethernet switch chips that counts Google among its financial backers. Late last year, The Information reported that CenturyLink was a “potential acquirer” of Google Fiber. RELATED: Building Fiber Networks: Difficult and Lame? “Google Fiber has been instrumental making the web faster and better for everyone — something I’ve been passionate about my entire career,” McCray said, in a statement. “I’m thrilled to lead Access as we continue in our mission to connect more people to abundant access, on networks that are always fast and always open.” McCray heads up Access following a recent decision to pause Google Fiber’s expansion plans as it concentrated on current deployments and explored less expensive wireless broadband alternatives.    RELATED: Google Fiber Pauses Expansion Plans, Laying Off Some Staff “Google Fiber remains focused on our customers and cities. We want to bring Google Fiber to customers faster, so we’re focused on making deployment more efficient and less intrusive,” a Google Fiber spokesperson said. “We’re thrilled that Greg has agreed to join as CEO, to drive this innovation and to grow the business.” The Google Fiber team is moving to a more decentralized structure that will allow for more innovation to come from the field, but a move that will also result in hundreds of employees shifting into new roles in Google and Alphabet, a person familiar with the matter said, confirming a story first reported by Bloomberg. The new structure, the person added, will likewise mean that Access will look a bit more like a startup again, with a focus on innovations designed to improve business results and service velocity. Google Fiber, the person added, will also look to serve existing subscribers and add new ones in the current cities, and is now in position to push ahead with previous plans to enter new cities such as Huntsville, Ala.; Louisville, Ky., and San Antonio, Texas. RELATED: Google Fiber to Ride Muni-Owned Huntsville Network Cities still on Google Fiber’s list for “potential” build outs include Dallas, Texas; Jacksonville, Fla.; Los Angeles, Calif.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; San Jose, Calif., Tampa, Fla.; and Portland, Ore.   Cities supported by Webpass, the wireless broadband company acquired last fall by Google Fiber, include Boston; Chicago; Miami, San Diego, San Francisco, and Oakland.

The impression of Silicon Valley as the Neverland of corporate life, a place full of office slides and go karts, captured the imagination of Chloe Bridgewater who decided to apply for a job at tech giant Google.  The 7-year-old was delighted to receive a response from Mr Pichai himself, her father Chris said in a post on Linkedin that has gone viral.  The letter sent by Sundar Pichai to Chloe Bridgewater Credit: Andy Bridgewater "I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish you set your mind to," the Google boss wrote in the letter.

Home Macs | 13 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (4) Chrome for iOS Gains QR Code and Barcode Scanning by Adam C. Engst I was playing around on my iPhone the other day and happened to use 3D Touch on the icon for the Google Chrome Web browser. Imagine my surprise when one of the “quick actions” that Chrome presented was Scan QR Code. And indeed, tapping it brought up a QR code scanning screen. It turns out that QR code and barcode scanning are new to version 56 of Chrome for iOS, which Google updated on 1 February 2017. For those who aren’t aware, a QR code uses regions of rectangles within a square to encode data, most commonly a URL to a Web page. QR codes are used in advertising, publishing, product tracking, and other fields where it’s helpful to have a graphical element stand in for a URL that would likely be impossible to remember or difficult to type, as I’ve done in the TCN screenshot below. QR codes are also used to seed two-factor authentication systems (see “Authy Protects Your Two-Factor Authentication Tokens,” 6 November 2014), and some companies even use the technology in payment systems — see “Walmart Pay Is Better Than You Might Expect,” 18 July 2016. Various apps and Web sites can create QR codes for you, and any designer using Adobe InDesign can insert one into a document merely by choosing Object > Generate QR Code. Although QR codes have been around since 1994 and in common use since 2009, they’ve never really taken off. That’s likely because Apple never built a general-purpose QR code scanner into the iPhone’s Camera app. (The Wallet app can scan QR codes, but it only understands QR codes associated with Wallet passes.) Glenn Fleishman bemoaned this lack almost five years ago in “Apple Could Make QR Codes Work with a Simple Tweak” (2 July 2012). With Chrome, scanning a QR code is easy, but you likely wouldn’t figure it out on your own because there is absolutely no indication of the feature within the app itself. Instead, you must either 3D Touch the app (if you have a compatible iPhone) and then tap Scan QR Code or search in Spotlight on “QR” and then tap a Scan QR Code search result. Then, center the QR code you want to scan in the camera’s viewfinder. Chrome scans nearly instantly (so much so that capturing the screenshots was hard), and puts the URL associated with the QR code into the address field so you can preview it — just tap the Go button to load the page. Chrome can also scan traditional barcodes, which it feeds directly into Google’s search engine to find product pages and the like. In the screenshot below, I’ve scanned the barcode on the bottom of my Garmin Forerunner 620 GPS watch box, and Google promptly displayed related information. If you have a dedicated QR code scanning app that you use regularly, you may prefer to stick with it. In particular, I found it clumsy to invoke Chrome’s scanner repeatedly, so a dedicated app may work better in such situations. But if, like me, you have to do a Spotlight search to find your QR code scanner anyway, it’s faster and easier to use Chrome from the Spotlight results screen.   Create a website to showcase your work.

Maybe I'm behind on the nomenclature or missed reading something, but if I do a search (in the window that appears if you drag down from the top), iScanner is the only app that shows up. And if I search for Chrome it opens and I don't see how to do scan. I get that I can do a 3D touch, but I have to find Chrome (is there a way to search and go to the app instead of opening it (macOS, show in Finder)? Thanks for the story. I almost never do a QR scan because I never remember how to do it. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-14 10:22 Hmm, I'm not sure why Spotlight isn't finding it.

You might also make sure the other switches at the top are on, though they didn't matter in my testing. Reply Anders Borg  2017-02-14 14:06 "they’ve never really taken off" They have industry/logistics-wise, but not for public use. I still try to change that. Can it only be activated via 3D Touch? That's a bummer, and not smart by Google. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-14 16:10 It's good to hear that QR codes are being used more in the back end of logistics systems. 3D Touch and Spotlight searches are the only way, yes. That's probably fine for casual users, but for anyone doing serious stuff with QR codes, a dedicated app would make more sense.

Maternity/paternity leave: The tech giant gives new dads six weeks paid leave and moms can take up to 18 weeks off after their child is born.

Google also awards new parents with ‘baby bonding bucks’, which helps with expenses such as diapers, food and other necessities. Living in the future: Employees can get their hands on cutting-edge products that are not year released to the public. Some employees have used devices, such as phones, tablets and Chromebooks, before they were released on the market.

The division of Alphabet has hired a new CEO, Gregory McCray, even as it shifted headquarters employees to other areas and some have speculated it might sell off the internet service division. File photo by John Sleezer jsleezer@kcstar.com i By Scott Canon scanon@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Google Fiber has a new boss, fewer headquarters employees and a future that’s becoming harder to predict. The company aimed to reassure customers Wednesday in its first-ever market that the TV subscriptions and internet connections it sells won’t be going away. “Google Fiber loves Kansas City and is here to stay,” the company said in an email. “We just announced our expansion into Raymore last week.” The statement comes after Access, the company division that includes Google Fiber, hired Gregory McCray to oversee the sale of internet service in markets such as Kansas City and the company’s exploration into other ways to deliver online connections besides fiber optic cables. McCray is the former CEO of broadband service company Aero Communications. “Google Fiber has been instrumental making the Web faster and better for everyone — something I’ve been passionate about my entire career,” McCray said in a statement issued Wednesday by the company. His hiring, first reported by Business Insider, fills a vacancy that had been open for months after Craig Barratt left the company. Barratt’s departure is one of a handful of signs that’s had analysts wondering if Google will stay in the business of selling broadband. Reports in The Information, Fortune and other publications in the tech trade press have explored the likelihood of whether Alphabet — the parent company to Google’s search division that has created hundreds of billions in stock value — would sell Google Fiber. A source who asked to be described as “familiar with the matter” said the company has no plans to sell. In an October 2016 earnings call, Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat was asked about the company’s commitment to Google Fiber. “There’s a sizable opportunity given the need for abundant connectivity … and we do continue to be committed to that vision,” she said. Analysts see a sale as at least plausible. Google Fiber was created, executives said when it launched the project in Kansas City almost six years ago, to make much faster internet available to home consumers. That’s happened. Most dramatically in markets such as Kansas City where Google Fiber built networks, consumer internet connections rocketed to speeds previously available only to large businesses and institutions like hospitals and universities. Average home internet speeds in the country ran about 5 megabits per second when Google Fiber said in 2011 it would build in Kansas City. Now the company sells internet hookups in nine markets. Its internet service moves a gigabit per second, or 200 times faster than the previous norm. Other telecommunication and cable companies responded, selling far faster internet connections than before. Spectrum, for instance, doubled speeds without raising prices in Kansas City. “Google Fiber accomplished their objectives, which is to get the telcos and cable providers to greatly increase their speeds,” said Glen Friedman of the Ideas & Solutions broadband consulting firm. Meantime, Google’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters has put increasing emphasis on its core business — the search functions that made it a tech giant. When Google Fiber was created, it pulled employees away from some of those functions. Now, hundreds of Google Fiber workers at the California headquarters will be shifted out of the division. The internet service division last year “paused” expansion into new markets. Instead, it’s exploring still-developing wireless technology to beam broadband to homes. “Google Fiber remains focused on our customers and cities,” the company said in an email. “We want to bring Google Fiber to customers faster, so we’re focused on making deployment more efficient and less intrusive.” The company’s new approach, in part, reflects the daunting cost of building a fiber optic network that reaches all the way through residential neighborhoods. “Just being in Kansas City” — and fewer than a dozen other markets — “is an interesting experiment. But if you really want to move the dial, you have to be national,” said Larry Gerbrandt, a cable industry analyst at Media Valuation Partners. “It’s a massive undertaking to wire the country. Is this where they want to put their money?” The job of hoisting wires on utility poles or burying them under streets and lawns “is one of the most capital-intensive things you can do,” he said. “It’s infrastructure. And that’s really expensive.” Analysts said it’s hard to speculate about who might want to buy what Google Fiber has already built. A cable company such as Spectrum, formerly Time Warner Cable, might be reluctant to purchase the customer contracts and physical networks in markets where it can already sell service. Other companies might be reluctant to buy a network to compete so directly with Spectrum. Yet analysts said the company has likely invested billions in Google Fiber assets across the country that would be valuable in a sale. &nbsp; Scott Canon: 816-234-4754, @ScottCanon Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Technology Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:31 Library program welcomes and informs homeless Pause 1:13 Wife and stepson of KKK leader Frank Ancona accused of murder 2:25 Kemper Arena plan envisions sports hub 3:55 How Schlitterbahn’s Verruckt was built in Wyandotte County 1:46 The science behind Schlitterbahn’s Verrückt 1:30 Helmet camera footage captures firefighter battling blaze 1:37 Trump wants to speed up NAFTA renegotiation 0:54 Royals Daily: Travis Wood is officially a Royal 0:47 Blue Valley students hold prayer vigil for coach Eric Driskell 0:32 Graphic content: Listen to K-State students chant '(expletive) KU' during recent game Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 5 days ago George, an 8-week-old Lab Mix, steals hearts on UberPUPPIES Day 1:49 5 days ago George, an 8-week-old Lab Mix, steals hearts on UberPUPPIES Day 2:12 8 days ago From CDs to fiber: AT&T exec talks about how the internet is evolving 0:53 8 days ago Smart City website launches in KC View more video Technology Google Fiber touts Kansas City presence amid speculation about company sale State, feds address cleanup at oil pipeline protest camp Deep Background: Has Google Fiber changed Kansas City?

Skip to content GPS Tracking Info Just another NEWS site Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Spain 2017: things are pretty nasty in Madrid, developments underway By admin in Uncategorized February 16, 2017 SPAIN – The turmoil continues in Spain. Various developments the past few hours cream a sentiment of upcoming developments soon with some fans even believing that in the end RTVE and Manel Navarro will withdraw from representing Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest and Mirela could replace him in Kyiv as rightful public choice. Well it remains to be seen… MIRELA’S MYSTERIOUS POST The runner up and tele voting winner of the Spanish national final, Mirela made a Facebook post days after the national final turmoil. In the post she says thank you to the fans who supported her, thanked the radio station which promised her to play her song after loosing the ticket for Eurovision and… promised to come back soon with … news! What can that mean? THE PARLIAMENT DEMANDS ANSWERS The entire parliament is against the government and the national final decision. The parliament demands from the government and TVE to answer a series of questions regarding the national final procedure and they demand an answer far before the legal deadline of March 20 as the EBU must have the song officially in their hands by March 13th. A DISTURBING GOOGLE SCREENSHOT In the meantime if you search in Google you can see this: Manel Navarro and his song seems to be available since August 11th, 2016 something which is breaching the rules of the EBU. Though when we click the link we see that the page content is not available in our country. We are trying to verify if there is a song actually posted on that date but Google search created questions. Not to mention of course that Los40.es posted that Manel Navarro is the Spanish representative in Eurovision 2017 before the voting started on 11th of February. WEIRD: LOS40 published the winner of Spanish final at 21:26 CET! kinda impossible for them to know the winner … unless…. well that's up to them to respond to it. In the meantime the chaos over Twitter and social media against RTVE and Manel Navarro continues with hundreds of post-protests – #eurovision #eurovisiongr #escpress #celebratediversity #oikotimes #avmag #melfest #umk2017 #impacthub #oev2017 #gay- join us for more on www.facebook.com/oikotimes and www.instagram.com/oikotimes A post shared by OIKOTIMES EUROVISION on Feb 11, 2017 at 4:13pm PST OGAE SPAIN FINALLY REACTS Lots of concerns forced OGAE Spain to go to public prosecutor asking explanation for various things regarding the national final. The regional fan club of Eurovision states that this doesn’t mean that they are pro or against the TVE national final decision but they are extremely worrying about various things.

Nji Patrick Gbah’s tailor shop in Bamenda is buzzing with business and pride. His son, Collins, was recently named one of 34 grand-prize winners in this year’s Google Code-In, a global challenge for young programmers. He used to punish his son for “joking” with the computer. Nji Collins Gbah “I was feeling that he is just spending his time without doing house chores. At times I used to seize my computer and lock it in the house and I tell him not to use it anymore because I was believing that he is just spending time on that computer for nothing,” said the teen’s father. Nji Collins Gbah has won a trip to Google headquarters in California this June with the other top finishers. The competition was open to students between the ages of 13 and 17. More than 1,300 young people from 62 countries participated this year. “The only thing I want to say is focus on studies,” Collins said. “Get to know more about the opportunities that are around you and go to sites which have real information about opportunities like this.” But that may be hard at the moment for his fellow students in Bamenda. In mid-January, the internet was cut to English-speaking parts of Cameroon, amid ongoing unrest. Collins had to plead with his uncle for travel money so he could go to to Mbouda, a French-speaking town 30 kilometers away, to get online and compete. He had just a few days to complete 842 programming tasks. Many believe the government ordered the internet blackout, though there has been no official confirmation. Teachers and lawyers have been on strike in the English-speaking regions since November. They have been joined by activists calling for secession. Some demonstrations have turned violent and dozens of people have been arrested. Officials say activists have been using social media to spread anti-government messages. Cameroon’s minister of post and telecommunication, Libom Li Likeng, told VOA there has to be a responsible use of technology. She says although social networks provide lots of opportunities, they have noticed that many people use them for unhealthy purposes. African countries have been increasingly responding to unrest by cutting internet access. Uganda, Congo and Mali are just a few other examples. Last week, a U.N. rights expert called the internet blackout in parts of Cameroon “an appalling violation” of freedom of expression. Residents in affected areas say it is impacting the economy as money transfer services and ATM’s are not working.

Today we have Facebook, WhatsApp, internet etc making life easy for our people even in the most remote areas. Hope you get out of that place soon before someone charges you with treason for traveling to Bafoussam to access internet. Your win came at this time to remind the world that everyone in West Cameroon is considered a suspect today in the land of their ancestors Even without internet? Good Luck!

Reply Mukong February 16, 2017 at 04:16 Nji Gbah, thank you for making us proud as well as for making the world appreciate the fact that not all youngsters in Southern Cameroon are like the weed smoking Brenda Biya of LRC. Please, stay focus and keep your eyes focus on the price. Reply AG February 16, 2017 at 06:10 Congrats Collins. It is safer for your to remain in California until your statehood is restored given the rate at which your age mates are being bundled up and incarcerated by the forces of darkness, lawlessness and disorder in LRC. You shall have all the resources to forge and never regret it. Reply benji February 16, 2017 at 08:10 Totally awesome petit frere. Go Indomitable Cub! Reply Colby February 16, 2017 at 08:49 Du courage petit ! you are a rare spice which can enhance the taste of Cameroon’s future . Reply Senator February 16, 2017 at 10:25 Mr Collins you have done it! Those who have Internet 24/7 still didn’t have a chance! Maybe if the competition was in the hands of Paul Biya he would have called Brenda and announce her the winner.

Huawei is said to be working on its own digital voice assistant according to a latest report from Bloomberg. The third largest smartphone maker is currently in the early stages of developing the technology with a team of 10 engineers. Initially, Huawei’s assistant will target domestic users and communicate in Chinese languages. However, the company will continue to work with Google and Amazon outside China, as per unnamed sources. Last month, Huawei announced it would use Alexa on its Mate 9 smartphone in the US market. Adding its own voice assistant will give Huawei leverage in the fiercely competitive Chinese smartphone market. The company was second largest smartphone maker in China in 2016 with 16.4% market share. Huawei is expected to announce P10 smartphone with dual rear camera on February 26 at MWC 2017 in Barcelona.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Phone 8.0 adds voicemail sharing and minor visual tweaks Newsby Edgar Cervantes2 hours ago 3 86 4 The Google Phone app is probably one of the most important in our devices. After all, a phone’s main feature is making calls… or at least it used to be. Either way, this application was updated on February 10 and most of us were left wondering just what the search giant did to it. It turns out it was more than the reported “bug fixes”. After some digging and a teardown, the guys from Android Police found a few features you may be interested in. These include voicemail sharing, a different “new contact” icon color and a future ability to send files during a call. Ever wanted to save a voicemail or share it with a friend? This is usually a complicated process that requires finding some loopholes, but the new Google Phone app gets rid of all your voicemail woes. Simply open the voicemail and scroll down to find the “Send to” option. It’s even possible to store the actual audio file wherever the user sees fit. One can put it in the cloud or a secure external hard drive, for example. As always, the new feature will come with its technical difficulties/bugs. For starters, reports claim the file is stored without a format clarification, but it is an MPGA. Another issue you might encounter is support for voicemail from the app. Some carriers and networks don’t go through the original app for voicemail (e.g. Project Fi). The last reported issue (and possibly the most annoying) is that sometimes the downloaded file appears to be empty. It is just a file with no information on it. In terms of clues discovered in the app, Google seems to be working on the ability to send a file and make a call simultaneously. This could be used to send an image of a location when calling someone, or possibly make the call a bit more personal with a special touch on the call screen.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here BERLIN: A Philadelphia court has made the unfortunate decision to reopen the legal debate on whether the US has the right to access e-mails stored on foreign servers if they belong to US companies. If Magistrate Thomas Rueter's ruling stands, anyone using US based internet companies will have to live with the knowledge that, as far as the US government is concerned, it's America wherever they operate. That's a dangerous approach that hurts the international expansion of US tech companies. Privacy-minded customers in Europe are already suspicious of the US government's cooperation with the tech giants, revealed by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Nationalist politicians in some countries want to ban cross-border personal data transfers. Last July, Microsoft won a landmark case against the US government, in which it argued it didn't have to hand over e-mails stored on a server in Dublin to investigators working on a drug case. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with the corporation, ruling that the US Congress never meant the Stored Communications Act to apply extra territorially. Just two weeks ago, the court allowed the ruling to stand. US internet companies have assumed that if communications are stored abroad, they are out of the US authorities' reach. Acting on that understanding, Google refused to disclose two users' data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI went to court in Philadelphia. Unlike Microsoft, Google doesn't even know the physical location of a file: its artificial intelligencebased system constantly optimises storage. Judge Rueter refused to be bound by the Microsoft precedent. In his ruling, he said : “When Google produces the electronic data in accordance with the search warrants and the Government views it, the actual invasion of the account holders' privacy -the searches -will occur in the United States.“ Within that logic, any information, public or private, that the US government can locate using computers on US territory is fair game. And if the logic applies, the European Union wasted its time last year as it tried to establish an acceptable privacy standard for US companies operating in Europe. A new framework for these companies became necessary after the European Court of Justice struck down the EU's so-called safe harbour agreement with the US, which allowed internet companies to shuttle personal data back and forth between the two jurisdictions based on an understanding that the US provided adequate protection for users' privacy. The so-called Privacy Shield is still pretty permissive, allowing companies to self-certify their commitment to user privacy, but it simplifies redress and gives European data privacy authorities more power over cross-border communication. If, however, the US decides that it can just take the data from foreign servers, the new agreement will be rendered meaningless. For US companies, this will mean a need to invent new private arrangements. It appointed Deutsche Telekom “data trustee“ for two data centres in Germany, making it impossible for anyone to obtain any information from the servers without the permission of the trustee and, ultimately, the client.Such tricks, however, may not stand up in US courts, if other judges agree with Rueter. The US Supreme Court will probably have to take a stand on the issue. Waiting for a decision, millions of foreigners must decide whether to cut their losses in this front of the online privacy wars: It may no longer be OK to expose their lives to US corporations.

At least, that’s according to Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet and former Google CEO. At the RSA security conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Schmidt spoke about the early days of his career building a network and mail system in the late 1970s while in a Masters program at the University of California, Berkeley. He touched on why internet security is still an ongoing issue, and why it’s not completely secure by default. “We now find ourselves back fixing it over and over again,” Schmidt said. “You keep saying, ‘Why didn’t we think about this?’ Well the answer is, it didn’t occur to us that there were criminals.” Hacking, stealing information and data breaches are common problems, and many people still don’t implement basic security features, such as strong passwords and two-factor authentication. And as more things become connected to the internet — like TVs and fridges — insecure gadgets in our home can be used as a network of bots that can take down major websites. Schmidt has said before that he and other early internet pioneers forgot to consider people who might use it for nefarious purposes. But internet companies still struggle to account for all the ways people might use their platforms. Twitter, a way to send 140-character blasts about what you’re eating for breakfast, morphed into a platform that elevates millions of voices, including harassers, racists and people inciting violence. The social media company was late on reacting to this behavior, and it’s still trying to wrestle with its ethos of supporting free speech and policing harmful behavior. Facebook, too, has experienced consequences its founders likely didn’t predict when launching as a platform for college students to connect. Fake news proliferates so much that the company now has to let users know what they’re reading is false. And despite founder Mark Zuckerberg denying Facebook is a media company, it’s evolved to be a key distributor of news and information, including launching its own video apps this week. As the Internet and companies built upon it continue to be used in new, unexpected ways, builders must account for behaviors outside of their own. No one will create a problem-free network. But by listening to and implementing diverse perspectives into the services people build, it may be possible to stop bad behavior before it affects literally everyone who uses the service.

Lee became one of 15 heads of an association of supporters for the South Chungcheong governor unveiled on the day. "The game of Go deeply pursues rationality. It is about maximizing the value of every move. No other figures are better associated with that kind of rationality than An," Lee said in an interview with An's campaign. Lee, a professional ninth-dan player, came into the international spotlight last year for his match with Google's AlphaGo. Lee lost 4-1 but proved his expertise and helped revive the popularity of the age-old Asian board game. Go, which originated in China more than 2,500 years ago, involves two players alternately putting black and white stones on a checkerboard-like grid of 19 lines by 19 lines. "I believe it is time that we should stop the dichotomy of progressivism and conservatism, or left and right. In this regard, I believe An is the best qualified," Lee said. An, a member of the main opposition Democratic Party, has recently surged in opinion polls of presidential candidates. A survey conducted by Realmeter this week put him in second place with an approval rating of 19.3 percent, up 2.6 percentage points on-week. He narrowed the gap with front-runner Moon Jae-in, former head of the party, who received 32.7 percent. South Korean Go champ Lee Se-dol (R), plays a game of Go with South Chungcheong Gov.

 That's a bit verbose and heavy to grab a few fields from a table. Fortunately, there's another way to access HBase data: by enabling Phoenix to allow for SQL queries against your dataset. You can create tables directly in SQL DDL with Phoenix, or you can create views on top of your existing HBase tables. Phoenix can be queried from the command line using the SQLLine Command line tool via  /usr/hdp/current/phoenix-client/bin/sqlline.py server:2181/hbase-unsecure. 0: jdbc:phoenix:server> select * from osquery limit 10;

</dependency> You can query Phoenix from most tools via its JDBC driver including DBVisualizer, Apache NiFi/HDF (ExecuteSQL), and others. For my Python people, you are not forgotten. pip install phoenixdb Here's a simple example usage: import phoenixdb

database_url = 'http://server:8765/'
conn = phoenixdb.connect(database_url, autocommit=True)

cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM tweets")
print cursor.fetchall() Phoenix is also queryable via Apache Zeppelin and its plain old SQL. That's a good selection for now. We'll do a deep dive into HBase and Phoenix in the next set of articles. As you can see, HBase is a nice database option, but with SQL on top, you get everything you need for big data with fast analytics, microservices access, enterprise querying, and tools.

Lee became one of 15 heads of an association of supporters for the South Chungcheong governor unveiled on the day.  South Korean Go champ Lee Se-dol (R), plays a game of Go with South Chungcheong Gov. An Hee-jung in this file photo taken in Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province, on Jan. 31, 2017. (Yonhap) "The game of Go deeply pursues rationality. It is about maximizing the value of every move. No other figures are better associated with that kind of rationality than An," Lee said in an interview with An's campaign. Lee, a professional ninth-dan player, came into the international spotlight last year for his match with Google's AlphaGo. Lee lost 4-1 but proved his expertise and helped revive the popularity of the age-old Asian board game. Go, which originated in China more than 2,500 years ago, involves two players alternately putting black and white stones on a checkerboard-like grid of 19 lines by 19 lines. "I believe it is time that we should stop the dichotomy of progressivism and conservatism, or left and right. In this regard, I believe An is the best qualified," Lee said. An, a member of the main opposition Democratic Party, has recently surged in opinion polls of presidential candidates. A survey conducted by Realmeter this week put him in second place with an approval rating of 19.3 percent, up 2.6 percentage points on-week. He narrowed the gap with front-runner Moon Jae-in, former head of the party, who received 32.7 percent. (Yonhap) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1. ‘The Handmaiden’ stays str... 2.

Nji Patrick Gbah’s tailor shop in Bamenda is buzzing with business and pride. His son, Collins, was recently named one of 34 grand-prize winners in this year’s Google Code-In, a global challenge for young programmers. He used to punish his son for “joking” with the computer. Nji Collins Gbah “I was feeling that he is just spending his time without doing house chores. At times I used to seize my computer and lock it in the house and I tell him not to use it anymore because I was believing that he is just spending time on that computer for nothing,” said the teen’s father. Nji Collins Gbah has won a trip to Google headquarters in California this June with the other top finishers. The competition was open to students between the ages of 13 and 17. More than 1,300 young people from 62 countries participated this year. “The only thing I want to say is focus on studies,” Collins said. “Get to know more about the opportunities that are around you and go to sites which have real information about opportunities like this.” But that may be hard at the moment for his fellow students in Bamenda. In mid-January, the internet was cut to English-speaking parts of Cameroon, amid ongoing unrest. Collins had to plead with his uncle for travel money so he could go to to Mbouda, a French-speaking town 30 kilometers away, to get online and compete. He had just a few days to complete 842 programming tasks. Many believe the government ordered the internet blackout, though there has been no official confirmation. Teachers and lawyers have been on strike in the English-speaking regions since November. They have been joined by activists calling for secession. Some demonstrations have turned violent and dozens of people have been arrested. Officials say activists have been using social media to spread anti-government messages. Cameroon’s minister of post and telecommunication, Libom Li Likeng, told VOA there has to be a responsible use of technology. She says although social networks provide lots of opportunities, they have noticed that many people use them for unhealthy purposes. African countries have been increasingly responding to unrest by cutting internet access. Uganda, Congo and Mali are just a few other examples. Last week, a U.N. rights expert called the internet blackout in parts of Cameroon “an appalling violation” of freedom of expression. Residents in affected areas say it is impacting the economy as money transfer services and ATM’s are not working.

It is this same attitude you started to use in hailing Hon Wirba after his parliamentary man of the year show only to make a u-turn few hours later and rejoice in police brutality. Always rushing to post junk 1st because of too much free time on your hands. Get a life idle turd. Reply MD February 16, 2017 at 02:28 Congratulations young man. Keep it up! Ras Tuge would hate him settling in Si Mountain Buea with his SWRM looney army that aims to own all mosquitoes while avoiding tigers! Nji Patrick, you will be welcome to the United States – a smart country that pulls top talent from all over the world to stay topmost. Reply John Dinga February 16, 2017 at 02:36 Congratulations for putting your country on the map! Great luck in scaling the hurdles along your path. Reply Lum February 16, 2017 at 03:11 Congratulations young man, like many in your generation you want to move Africa in a different direction, unfortunately there are to many grand papas in power who are willing to die with Africa than let you guys change it to benefit the many. Today we have Facebook, WhatsApp, internet etc making life easy for our people even in the most remote areas. Hope you get out of that place soon before someone charges you with treason for traveling to Bafoussam to access internet. Your win came at this time to remind the world that everyone in West Cameroon is considered a suspect today in the land of their ancestors Even without internet? Good Luck!

It is safer for your to remain in California until your statehood is restored given the rate at which your age mates are being bundled up and incarcerated by the forces of darkness, lawlessness and disorder in LRC.

Those who have Internet 24/7 still didn’t have a chance! Maybe if the competition was in the hands of Paul Biya he would have called Brenda and announce her the winner. Biya’s legs are now like a banana stem, you don’t need a weapon to knock him down just a gentle wind. That is same for his military! Just look at the trucks that had accident in Yaoundé yesterday… what kind of military is that?

CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is set to meet with Rev. Jesse Jackson "in the near future" to discuss the company's diversity initiatives ahead of its looming expansion into Oakland. The meeting was confirmed Wednesday by an Uber spokeswoman. Over the last couple of years, Jackson has been putting public pressure on major tech firms to disclose the demographics of their workforces and make commitments to improve the hiring of minorities and women. Uber has been one of the most notable companies not to release these figures or make public its efforts to improve diversity. Jackson zeroed in on Uber in January. The civil rights leader gave the tech company a deadline of Feb. 15 to create a program and make a commitment to reflect the diverse demographics of Oakland. Uber has yet to release these figures, but the company has been in touch with Jackson's Rainbow Push organization over the last few weeks. A spokesman for Jackson told Inc. that he will meet with the ride-hailing company around the time of Apple's shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for Feb. 28 in Cupertino, Calif. Jackson is an Apple stockholder. With Uber planning to move about 2,300 employees to Oakland as soon as this year, local organizations in the Bay Area city have also been calling on the company to release its diversity figures and make a commitment to hiring diverse local talent.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do." It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its $246 billion cash pile to meet ambitions sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things" rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3 billion purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400 million acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc.’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1 billion, including its $22 billion WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp. has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50 billion by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50 billion target, the company must find an extra $13 billion in services revenue over the next four years -- beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc. ended 2016 with sales of less than $9 billion, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co. and electric carmaker Tesla Inc., Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition," said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55 billion under management. The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry.  When AT&T Inc. agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd., people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc. and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger -- you may call it arrogance -- about the culture there,” said Risley of  Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for $9.5 billion, Microsoft had to write down $7.6 billion of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60 percent in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60 billion -- 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal. "There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers," Victory Capital’s Maronak said.

AFP PHOTO / BEN STANSALL (Photo credit should read BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images) × Disney, Google cut ties with YouTube star ‘PewDiePie’ accused of anti-Semitism Swedish video game commentator Felix Kjellberg, aka PewDiePie poses with his new book, 'This book loves you' at an event in central London, on October 18, 2015. AFP PHOTO / BEN STANSALL (Photo credit should read BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images) LONDON (CNNMoney) — A star YouTuber has been dumped by Google and Disney after being accused of using anti-Semitic jokes and Nazi imagery. With 53 million subscribers, Felix Kjellberg — or “PewDiePie” — is one of the most popular filmmakers on YouTube. The Swede has turned radioactive, however, after the Wall Street Journal reported that he has posted nine videos since August that include objectionable material. One video shows two men holding a sign that reads, “Death to All Jews.” YouTube said Tuesday that it has canceled the second season of Kjellberg’s show, called Scare PewDiePie, that had been commissioned for its YouTube Red subscription service. A spokeswoman declined to say how much Kjellberg would have earned for the season, but major stars can earn fees comparable to those of TV show creators. YouTube has also removed the PewDiePie channel from its “Google Preferred” service, which includes the network’s most watched and shared videos. Maker Studios, a division at Disney which produces YouTube content, confirmed that it has also severed ties with Kjellberg. “Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate,” the company said in a statement. YouTube has not removed the videos produced by Kjellberg, but it did strip some of them of advertisements. Kjellberg appears to have removed one of the videos himself. In a statement posted to his blog, Kjellberg said that he does not support “any kind of hateful attitudes.” “I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary,” he said. “Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive.” Kjellberg’s videos have been viewed more than 14.6 billion times on YouTube. Forbes estimates that he earned $15 million in the year ended June 2016.

Name: Subject: Message: Huawei may add to the already crowded field of voice-based digital assistants Newsby John Callaham5 hours ago 8 423 4 Are you ready to use yet another digital assistant? If you live in China, you may get that chance. A new report claims Huawei is working on its own voice-based AI service, which would compete with other similar products, including Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa. See also: Huawei CEO Richard Yu talks new partnerships, growth in interview at CES 2017 January 6, 2017 The report from Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, claims that Huawei is in the early stages of developing the voice assistant, but it still has over 100 people actively working on it. The assistant will only be used in China, according to the article. Huawei will work with other companies to add third-party AI services when it offers its phones outside the country. Huawei already plans to add support for Alexa to its Mate 9 phone in the US, via a software update that’s planned for release sometime in March. Even though this report says Huawei’s in-house voice assistant will only be used in China, that’s still a massive market for smartphones. It may mean that Google Assistant, which currently is only used in the company’s Pixel and Pixel XL phones, won’t be available for future Huawei Android handsets in that country. That could be a big loss for Google, as it is reportedly trying to get Assistant pre-installed on more third-party devices. Huawei is not the only Android phone maker developing its own AI outside of Google. Samsung will reportedly debut its Bixby assistant as part of the the launch of its Galaxy S8 phone in April. What do you think of Huawei making its own voice-assistant service in China? Do you think it could find its way to other markets if it is successful in its home country? Are there simply way too many voice-based assistants being made? Let us know what you think of this already crowded field that’s looks like it’s about to get even more crowded in the comments!

Firstly, Google Shopping will finally launch - a major step forward for Ireland's e-commerce stores. It opens the door to rich media ads on the search engine results page. Instead of just text ads, consumers can see the product and get a breakdown on specs. While it's still not known exactly when Google Shopping will arrive in Ireland, Lyons is telling clients to get set up with Merchant Centre and prepare product feed. That way, they can be up and running when the launch happens. Facebook ad revenue continues to grow, with 84pc of spend coming from mobile in the third quarter of 2016. Growth is partly due to new ad formats but mainly because it's still the best digital channel for using demographics. Advertisers can overlay their search campaigns by focusing on age and gender. However, Mediaworks' client trials found the results to be "underwhelming", due to the number of users in the unknown category. Google is trying to improve the functionality so audience targeting is more accurate. For advanced paid search, campaigns will become as much about audiences as they are about keywords. Search advertisers can reduce wasted clicks by using products such as Remarketing Lists for Search Ads, tackling irrelevant audiences and bidding higher for audiences with more lucrative leads. But Lyons isn't over-excited about 2017 being mobile's 'finest hour', as has been touted since 2014. Clients and search marketers need to think about landing pages, content and campaign set-up from a mobile-first perspective. Last year, mobile conversion rates improved and, as a result, consumers complete forms on their mobiles. Marketers should now build accounts knowing that most traffic growth will be from mobile. Expanded Text Ads mean mobile-specific ads don't need to be written. Using Google's device-specific bid modifiers, advertisers can run mobile-only campaigns. It will be key in speeding up slow mobile performance, in simplifying mobile page content and ensuring online forms and checkout processes are more streamlined. There's been much hype about voice search, with ComScore predicting half of all searches will be voiced by 2020. But Lyons says, while voice search will increase, there should be no let-up in consumers typing search queries. * One e-commerce retailer with plans to take advantage of Google Shopping is AppliancesDelivered.ie. Part of Denis O'Brien's Communicorp, the home appliances site says it now has a 10pc share of the €250m market after just a year competing with the likes of Currys, Harvey Norman and DID Electrical.   Communicorp's group marketing director, Cliona Hayes, says one reason AppliancesDelivered has excelled is that the old-style, bricks and mortar retailers haven't been able to fully crack the online market. "Buying such goods is a grudge purchase, so our brand promise is to take the hassle out of buying home appliances," Hayes told AdLib. "Consumers can go to the website and, in four clicks, can buy appliances from 9am to 8pm, seven days a week. They are assured of same or next day delivery in the greater Dublin area, installation and their old appliance taken away free of charge." Today FM presenter Dermot Whelan fronts the AppliancesDelivered ads. As well as Communicorp's Today FM, Newstalk, 98FM and Spin 1038, spots run on RTE Radio 1. After TV trials last May, Hayes saw a 63pc rise in online traffic. The TV ads were shot by Irish production companies Fail Safe Films and Along Came a Spider, with space buying by Core's ZenithOptimedia. Hayes hired Jonny Davis's Because experiential agency to create street stunts, with Mr Ireland showing up topless as 'Iron Man' to iron shirts on Grafton Street, much to the amusement of passers-by. Communicorp also invests in Google AdWords and paid search. Back in October, Ignite Research was hired to do brand tracking. After just nine months' trading, prompted awareness was at 42pc. Hayes hopes awareness will double by October. * Events agency Green Light has rebranded as Cogs & Marvel. Founded in 2006 by Roisin Callaghan and Jane Gallagher, the agency's first major gig was in staging Google's European sales conference in Seville. They have since handled projects for Fáilte Ireland, Matheson, MasterCard and Mason Hayes & Curran. Ex-Ogilvy boss Dave Smyth is Cogs & Marvel's ceo.

Nji Patrick Gbah’s tailor shop in Bamenda is buzzing with business and pride. His son, Collins, was recently named one of 34 grand-prize winners in this year’s Google Code-In, a global challenge for young programmers. He used to punish his son for “joking” with the computer. Nji Collins Gbah “I was feeling that he is just spending his time without doing house chores. At times I used to seize my computer and lock it in the house and I tell him not to use it anymore because I was believing that he is just spending time on that computer for nothing,” said the teen’s father. Nji Collins Gbah has won a trip to Google headquarters in California this June with the other top finishers. The competition was open to students between the ages of 13 and 17. More than 1,300 young people from 62 countries participated this year. “The only thing I want to say is focus on studies,” Collins said. “Get to know more about the opportunities that are around you and go to sites which have real information about opportunities like this.” But that may be hard at the moment for his fellow students in Bamenda. In mid-January, the internet was cut to English-speaking parts of Cameroon, amid ongoing unrest. Collins had to plead with his uncle for travel money so he could go to to Mbouda, a French-speaking town 30 kilometers away, to get online and compete. He had just a few days to complete 842 programming tasks. Many believe the government ordered the internet blackout, though there has been no official confirmation. Teachers and lawyers have been on strike in the English-speaking regions since November. They have been joined by activists calling for secession. Some demonstrations have turned violent and dozens of people have been arrested. Officials say activists have been using social media to spread anti-government messages. Cameroon’s minister of post and telecommunication, Libom Li Likeng, told VOA there has to be a responsible use of technology. She says although social networks provide lots of opportunities, they have noticed that many people use them for unhealthy purposes. African countries have been increasingly responding to unrest by cutting internet access. Uganda, Congo and Mali are just a few other examples. Last week, a U.N. rights expert called the internet blackout in parts of Cameroon “an appalling violation” of freedom of expression. Residents in affected areas say it is impacting the economy as money transfer services and ATM’s are not working.

Ras Tuge would hate him settling in Si Mountain Buea with his SWRM looney army that aims to own all mosquitoes while avoiding tigers! Nji Patrick, you will be welcome to the United States – a smart country that pulls top talent from all over the world to stay topmost. Reply John Dinga February 16, 2017 at 02:36 Congratulations for putting your country on the map! Great luck in scaling the hurdles along your path. Reply Lum February 16, 2017 at 03:11 Congratulations young man, like many in your generation you want to move Africa in a different direction, unfortunately there are to many grand papas in power who are willing to die with Africa than let you guys change it to benefit the many. Today we have Facebook, WhatsApp, internet etc making life easy for our people even in the most remote areas. Hope you get out of that place soon before someone charges you with treason for traveling to Bafoussam to access internet. Your win came at this time to remind the world that everyone in West Cameroon is considered a suspect today in the land of their ancestors Even without internet? Good Luck! Reply tendemo February 16, 2017 at 03:35 @BMG my Bros concerning our previous laptop debate any comments ? We should do well to encourage such young minds. Once more congrats Nji, now your Dads gonna be forced to buy about 2 computers for you and one each for everyone else in the house. Kikikiki life is good ! Reply Mukong February 16, 2017 at 04:16 Nji Gbah, thank you for making us proud as well as for making the world appreciate the fact that not all youngsters in Southern Cameroon are like the weed smoking Brenda Biya of LRC. Please, stay focus and keep your eyes focus on the price. Reply AG February 16, 2017 at 06:10 Congrats Collins. It is safer for your to remain in California until your statehood is restored given the rate at which your age mates are being bundled up and incarcerated by the forces of darkness, lawlessness and disorder in LRC. You shall have all the resources to forge and never regret it. Reply benji February 16, 2017 at 08:10 Totally awesome petit frere. Go Indomitable Cub! Reply Colby February 16, 2017 at 08:49 Du courage petit ! you are a rare spice which can enhance the taste of Cameroon’s future . Reply Senator February 16, 2017 at 10:25 Mr Collins you have done it! Those who have Internet 24/7 still didn’t have a chance! Maybe if the competition was in the hands of Paul Biya he would have called Brenda and announce her the winner. Biya’s legs are now like a banana stem, you don’t need a weapon to knock him down just a gentle wind. That is same for his military! Just look at the trucks that had accident in Yaoundé yesterday… what kind of military is that?

Google this week announced beta availability of Cloud Spanner, a distributed database service that it says combines the guaranteed transactional consistency of relational databases with the high-scalability of NoSQL databases. Cloud Spanner, according to the company, is currently the only available relational database service that is horizontally scalable, meaning it can run on thousands of servers while also supporting Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) transactions. It supports all the standard features associated with relational database management systems including SQL queries and relational schemas and is well suited for very high transaction workloads said Deepti Srivastava, Google’s product manager for Cloud Spammer in a blog. Examples of applications that are ideal workloads for Cloud Spanner include financial applications and inventory management systems that are outgrowing the capabilities of relational database technologies. Organizations that have MySQL or PostgreSQL systems that are running at full capacity in particular can benefit from Cloud Spanner, she said. As a managed service offering from Google, Cloud Spanner offers several benefits for database administrators.  For example, enterprises can now scale out their relational databases without having to resort to clustering or data "sharding," a process where very large databases are broken up into multiple smaller ones. Cloud Spanner allows administrator to scale their databases horizontally across hundreds or thousands of servers, instead of the more limited vertical scaling available with conventional relational database technologies. This makes it easier for organizations to take advantage of usage-based cloud models offered by Google, Srivatsava said, “Your database scales up and down as needed, and you’ll only pay for what you use.” Because Cloud Spanner supports high-availability features enterprises do not have to engineer and implement a separate failover and replication infrastructure for it. Importantly, Cloud Spanner includes several security features that are likely to appeal to enterprises including default encryption for data in transit and at rest, audit logging and identity and access management, Srivatsava said. Cloud Spanner supports standard development tools and currently offers client libraries in Java, Python, Go and Node.js so developers can work in familiar application development environments. Google began work on Cloud Spanner in 2007. Its goal was to bridge the gap between traditional databases with their high degree of consistency and reliability and NoSQL technologies, which offered the scale and speed needed for modern applications, but lacked some of the reliability offered by RDBMS. Over the past several years, Google has been using the technology internally to run hundreds of applications and petabytes worth of data across its global data centers, Srivatsava said.  Some of the company’s most critical applications including Google Play and its AdWords web advertising platform currently run on Cloud Spanner, according to Srivatsava. Pricing for Cloud Spanner is tied to the amount of nodes that an enterprise might use for a particular project, the amount of storage used and the amount of bandwidth consumed by an application. Pricing starts at $0.90 per node per hour while storage starts at $0.30 cents per gigabyte per month.           LATEST DATABASE ARTICLES   Microsoft SQL Server Surges in Solid IT's Database Rankings Why Graph Search Continues to Gain Traction in Age of IoT Microsoft Bolsters Performance of SQL Server Database on Linux Oracle Q2 Earnings Mixed, co-CEO Joins Trump Transition Team Microsoft Previews SQL Server With Linux Support                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows HPE Acquires Security Analytics Vendor Niara A Look at What's Next for Ubuntu Linux in 2017 Kaspersky Discovers New Malware Designed to Stealthily Steal Data Ransomware Takes Out 70 Percent of Washington DC Security Cameras Encryption for Data at Rest comes to Azure File Storage 10 Reasons Why Apple iPad Sales Conti...

In total, Google has been asked to remove over two billion individual URLs from search results. The number of takedown requests is up significantly year-over-year, which could be due in part to the fact that anti-piracy firms are asking Google to delist dozens of URLs at a time. Google investigates the requests and regularly pushes back on those found to not actually be infringing on copyrighted work. Here is just one of the several examples Google provides: It’s not just sites hosting illegal content that are being targeted, Google routinely gets asked to remove content from credible websites such as the BBC, NASA, New York Times, Netflix, and The White House. Needless to say, Google rejects requests to remove content from legitimate sites. The number of URLs approved for removal far outweigh the number of URLs that have been rejected. Within the report you can search for any domain or URL and see how many takedown requests it has received, as well as how many of the requests were approved or rejected. For example, you can see that IMDB (Internet Movie Database) has received over 1000 takedown requests to date — all of which have been rejected. On the other side of the coin you can see an illegal content site like Torrentz.com has received over a million takedown requests, 98% of which have been approved. Google details the process it follows when receiving takedown requests: Copyright owner sends takedown notice Google reviews the takedown notice and removes the URL from search results if it truly infringes on copyrighted work The administrator of the affected site is notified via Google Search Console The administrator then has the opportunity to file a counter notification Google reviews the counter notification and decides whether or not to reinstate the material If the copyright owner is not satisfied with the final decision, they can file a lawsuit Related Posts 1.75 Billion Websites Removed from Google Search Results Google Deals With Over 2 Million Piracy Takedown Requests Per Day Google Disabled Over 780 Million Ads for Policy Violations in 2015 Google Ordered to Remove Follow-Up Stories of Right to Be Forgotten Subjects ADVERTISEMENT Bio Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Latest Posts Matt Southern Lead News Writer at Search Engine Journal Matt Southern has been the lead news writer at Search Engine Journal since 2013.

CloudVelox eases migration of core business apps to the cloud Video Getting a bead on tech trends for 2017 Attracting more developers to Cloud Foundry's cloud native application framework is the top priority for the open source foundation's new boss, Abby Kearns. Kearns took on the role as executive director late last year, following the departure of former CEO, Sam Ramji, who joined Google's enterprise cloud division. Meanwhile, Chip Childers became the Foundation's CTO. The reshuffle followed a solid year for Cloud Foundry, adding new members including Google, Bosch and Volkswagen, while the Foundation has updated its strategy around containers with the transition to a new container manager system, Diego. There are now 2,800 code contributors and 140 full time committers for Cloud Foundry and, in a wider context platform as a service - which has lagged way behind other cloud delivery models - is gaining ground too, with revenues expected to grow at 18.5 percent a year according to Gartner. However, adoption remains at a relatively early stage in comparison to IaaS and SaaS and Kearns says that attracting more developers is a key part of expansion plans in the next 12 months. "Cloud Foundry is one of those rare products where it has tremendous adoption and no one really knows about it - it is like the best-kept secret," says Kearns. "While that is fun and all, I would like it to be a little less of a secret. So we are going to spend a lot of time this year building awareness." This means building out an ecosystem of services around Cloud Foundry to support developers, Kearns says, as well as catering more to programmers at the Foundation's Summit events. While Cloud Foundry is aimed at easing the process of application development, only a third of attendees at its annual US Summit were developers. "If you go to all the events this year you will see that there is a very different tone," Kearns says. "We are actually going to be targeting developers as well as the operators, so we will build out tracks and focusing on developer and language communities and make summits a place where developers can go and network and learn about developing applications on Cloud Foundry." Enterprise PaaS challenges A number of large enterprises are now using Cloud Foundry to build new applications. For example, Volkswagen is using a combination of OpenStack and Cloud Foundry to create new connected car and mobility service software more quickly. Most of the large UK banks are using the technology to some degree, according to Kearns. See also: Volkswagen continues open source cloud push with Cloud Foundry However, one of the challenges for growing enterprise adoption of Cloud Foundry is that it can require an overhaul of internal processes. Adopting new development practices and modern application architectures is as much a cultural issue as a technical one, Kearns says. This is reflected in how Cloud Foundry is used by customers. For example, vendors such as Pivotal and IBM are focused on helping businesses understand continuous delivery and test-driven deployment as well as selling them software tools. "Cloud Foundry in enterprise organisations is often used as a shim, a forcing function as it were, for digital transformation," Kearns says. "So it becomes a technology that is enabling that business transformation." "That shift is difficult to undertake and not just for developers and operators but the business as a whole, because it is asking you to really rethink the way that you think about your entire organisation and the role technology plays in it." She adds: "It is not just pulling developers and operators closer together, it is what are we developing, what is the product, how do we iterate, take in customer feedback and point that back into a new product or new technology, how do we hire or retain talent, what does that look like, how do we manage the financials and investments towards the future." Lessons from OpenStack There are clearly parallels to be drawn between Cloud Foundry and OpenStack, the open source cloud project which targets the infrastructure as a service layer in data centres. Kearns says that the Cloud Foundry Foundation has learned from both the successes and struggles of OpenStack. "We have learned a lot from them but we have also taken a very different path," she says. "Cloud Foundry has evolved and operates very differently from OpenStack in terms of how development works. But there are a lot of things we have taken from them - like OpenStack Days which are really community-driven events. They gave us all of the information to create the Cloud Foundry Days we rolled out at the end of last year, so we have definitely learned a lot from the path that they paved for us and obviously Cloud Foundry and OpenStack is a compelling use case for many users - Bloomberg, Yahoo Japan to name but a few. "But I think we will learn from some of the struggles on integrity of the technology and from how the technology evolves. We have kept a tighter grip and opinion on the technology to ensure that it doesn't become something so cumbersome and complex that users cannot run it at scale." Concerns were raised around support for OpenStack last year with two big backers - HPE and Cisco - reducing their involvement to some degree. For HPE this meant the sale of its OpenStack and Cloud Foundry assets to open source software vendor Suse (although HPE will continue to sell both services). "It is interesting," says Kearns. "I am excited to see where SUSE takes the OpenStack and Cloud Foundry assets and the technology and what they do with it. They have obviously a great story with their Linux distribution as well as Ceph and I am excited to see what they are going to bring to the table both in terms of committers and contributors. But as a member of our board their voice will mean a lot as we think about the strategy for Cloud Foundry."

Jeff Butts @clefmeister Feb 15th, 2017 3:13 PM EST | Editorial Let’s talk about AI, or artificial intelligence. Microsoft has Cortana and Google has its Assistant. On your iOS and tvOS devices, we have Siri. If you’re an Amazon fan, Alexa is present in the Echo, Echo Dot, Fire TV, and Amazon Tap. All of these are very capable virtual assistants, but Siri and Alexa seem to dominate the artificial intelligence landscape for many of us. Which is more intelligent, though, Siri or Alexa? Let’s take a look at the two and see if we can call the race. Image licensed under Creative Commons CC BY-SA 3.0. Credit: NY First, what do we mean by “more intelligent?” We can’t really quantify how much information the various forms of AI have at their disposal. The repositories feeding them are too vast. When I ask which is more intelligent, I mean which offers the most capabilities and the best level of accuracy. AI isn’t of much use if you can’t do anything with it. Furthermore, it needs to grow and adapt to our expanding use of technology. That’s why I consider the breadth of capabilities built into the AI software to be roughly half of what I use to measure the assistant’s intelligence. Next we have accuracy. If your AI can’t understand you and respond correctly, it won’t be much more than a nuisance. For a virtual assistant to be worth its salt, it needs to quickly comprehend what you’re asking of it. Then it should respond either by performing the requested action(s) or providing the information you’re looking for. Hence the importance of accuracy in measuring the intelligence of the AI. Alexa and Siri: the early stages Siri and Alexa are both growing in capabilities day by day. Until the launch of iOS 10, though, Alexa had a very strong lead in this category. Amazon expanded Alexa almost daily with new Skills, which you could enable through the Alexa app on your smartphone. These Skills allowed you to do everything from play games to turn your lights on or off. Integration with third-party apps and hardware has grown exponentially since Amazon first launched the Echo to the general public in June 2015. As of January 2017, Amazon’s Alexa had more than 7,000 Skills available for use. Siri, on the other hand, launched in iOS 5 on the iPhone 4S in October of 2011. The virtual assistant was integrated into the mobile operating system, but capabilities were somewhat limited. The virtual assistant could help you with built-in Apple iPhone apps and could look up information on Wolfram Alpha and the Web. As far as integrating with third-party apps, though – nope, that wasn’t possible. So, until recently at least, Alexa had the lead in capabilities. You could simply do much more with Amazon’s smart assistant than you could with Apple’s. Virtually everything Siri was capable of doing, so was Alexa. But Alexa could also do so much more.

I know nothing about Alexa, but it’s fairly certain she can be no worse than Siri. One thing is for sure, I do not want Siri driving my car. She has yet to handle dictation properly.

Many were left curious about the Sony SmartWatch 3, since it was Sony’s one and only Android Wear device and was — unfortunately — left off the list. You could have probably guessed this since the watch was left off the first list, but it seems that Sony’s website was updated recently to say officially that the SmartWatch 3 will not be getting Android Wear 2.0. You can find the text at the bottom of the SmartWatch 3 product page (via Xperia Blog): SmartWatch 3 SWR50 supports up to Android Wear 1.5. Android Wear 2.0 and onwards are not supported. So if you had any doubt in your mind that Sony had officially ditched its one Android Wear smartwatch for good, you can consider the matter settled. Sony tried, but the company assumably concluded that Android Wear wasn’t going to be a huge success, so they quit. And at least one other OEM seemingly came to the same conclusion.

The 1.0 release was announced as part of the first annual TensorFlow Developer Summit, and Google also published details on its Developers blog. Google says there are three major tentpoles to this release. It’s fast, more flexible, and more production-ready. Google can describe these new additions a lot better than I can, but basically the gist is that there are plenty of performance improvements, new API modules as part of a high-level API for TensorFlow, and the release promises Python API stability: It’s faster: TensorFlow 1.0 is incredibly fast! XLA lays the groundwork for even more performance improvements in the future, and tensorflow.org now includes tips & tricks for tuning your models to achieve maximum speed. We’ll soon publish updated implementations of several popular models to show how to take full advantage of TensorFlow 1.0 – including a 7.3x speedup on 8 GPUs for Inception v3 and 58x speedup for distributed Inception v3 training on 64 GPUs! It’s more flexible: TensorFlow 1.0 introduces a high-level API for TensorFlow, with tf.layers, tf.metrics, and tf.losses modules. We’ve also announced the inclusion of a new tf.keras module that provides full compatibility with Keras, another popular high-level neural networks library. It’s more production-ready than ever: TensorFlow 1.0 promises Python API stability (details here), making it easier to pick up new features without worrying about breaking your existing code. There are plenty of other changes in this version too. “Python APIs have been changed to resemble NumPy more closely,” Google says, there are new experimental APIs for Java and Go, and there are also new Android demos “for object detection and localization.” You can watch videos describing all these new features from the first TensorFlow dev summit over at YouTube.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 February 2017 by Military News Img Link’s remarkable new services now available across North America Omaha, NE February 16, 2017 Img Link, one of North America’s premier web development and advertising service organizations, announced their completed expansion of OneLookOnline.com into the United States. “It was important for us to make OneLookOnline.com, one of our most popular services in Canada, available to every business across North America. We enjoyed remarkable success with the roll-out of ContractorImages.com earlier this year and intend on using the knowledge gained from that experience as a guiding framework moving forward to expand the service.” Img Link was quick to point out some of the enhancements and design changes for the undertaking. “We wanted to create an entirely new customer experience with this launch. We already have a solid record of achieving first page Google results for many of our customers with detailed and wide-ranging profile information. Late last year, we also changed the way businesses communicate with their customers with the introduction of the revolutionary SMS Live Chat service.” “It was important for us to add features over and above what our clients have come to expect from us and I think we have done exactly that” Two of the standout services that are currently available according to to the company are a collection of complimentary management apps and video advertising services. “What’s really great about the apps is they work with almost any business model. We designed them with a broad purpose and can help them manage their organizations expenses and create estimates for their customers.

For those who are still unprepared it is not too late to swot for these exams.Most students with internet access,smartphones and tablets hardly ever use this technology for their benefit. A good number of them use of the Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp Apps and scarcely use anything else. The first thing that you should do is to make sure that you have a copy of the syllabus for each of the subjects that you are writing. If  do not already have these you can freely download PDF versions of both the O level and A level syllabi from the ZIMSEC website. The list includes electronic copies for most common subjects but on the off chance that your subject is not available then you might need to make the trip to your nearest ZIMSEC office and purchase a physical copy. One of the most disappointing parts about the ZIMSEC website is that it does not have downloadable copies of past exam papers or specimen papers. Bearing in mind your syllabus requirements for each one of your subjects you should be aware that ZIMSEC shares most of its content with Cambridge and most questions appear in both exams. For subjects like Business Studies there is virtually no difference at all in terms of content. You can use Cambridge past exam papers and their corresponding marking schemes to practice. Some of them can be freely downloaded on the Cambridge website here ( this site was updated yesterday). There are a host of other sites such as the IGSCE center here and the Online exam center website. Google will cheerfully provide you with more sites. It is amazing how many students keep repeating the same errors each year. Some errors even originate from uninformed teachers, I know a local teacher who still teaches the horizontal method of preparing accounts and has year after year unwittingly sent students to their failure. Each year examiners report on these errors and any other mistakes and tips that students might need to know about. The ZIMSEC website has a few copies of these reports. If you are interested in excelling in your exams it might be important to download and read these for all the subjects that you are writing. Here are the links for both A level and O level reports. I had the honour of attending the best academic school in this country, St Faith’s High School, and technology has always been part of their success. Back when I was still a student their most important piece of technology was their photocopying machine which enabled students to sit for mock exams. We sat for every paper from 1973 to that year’s June exam. ZIMSEC sells hard copies all past exam papers at $2 apiece. You can use a photocopying machine to create multiple copies of the paper and practice. It is illegal to sell these papers without prior permission from ZIMSEC who are the copyright owners although it is generally acceptable to use this means for personal non profit use under the law. advertisement You can also install Cambridge Apps to help with your English. English is the language of instruction for almost all the subjects except Shona. It is even permissible to answer Shona Paper 2 in English. Most students although fluent in the spoken lingo are often afflicted by a meagre vocabulary and the inability to distinguish informal and formal language. These are paid apps which would provide help in such areas as grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation ( by the way Pronunciation differs but it should not differ.) The Apps are available for most devices including Android, iPhone, iPad, (and for some selected Apps) Blackberry and Windows. Remember if you are to pass the exams you need to practice and technology can help you get there. Mazel Tov in your exams!!! I must surely have failed to mention a lot of notable tools.

Today, the US patent office has ruled on disputed patents by the inventors of CRISPR/Cas9, Nasa may send crew up on the maiden flight of its new SLS rocket, Verizon has dropped its offer for Yahoo by $250 million due to undisclosed security breaches, and more.

US patent office upholds disputed CRISPR/Cas9 invention patent The US patent office has ruled in a dispute over the invention of the massively important CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique, and has upheld controversial patents issued to the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (STAT). The Broad Institute's patents were issued through an accelerated application process that put them ahead of the patents - filed earlier - by the University of California Berkeley's Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, who published the first paper on CRISPR and are generally regarded by the scientific community as the technique's pioneers. The judges ruled that the Broad Institute patent's represented "no interference in fact" - allowing both patent claims to stand - and that the Broad had persuaded them that "that the parties claim patentably distinct subject matter", as the paper by the Broad's Feng Zhang includes a method of using CRISPR in eukaryotic cells - required to edit the genomes of mammalian cells. The judges, unlike most commentators within the scientific community, feel that this extension of the technique "would not have been obvious" from Doudna and Charpentier's paper. The verdict will have an impact on both licensing of the technique for medical use and the recognition of its pioneers. UC Berkley has said it is pleased that both patents will be allowed to stand but that it "will be carefully considering all possible legal options at this juncture".

Nasa may send crew up on the maiden flight of its new SLS rocket In an unexpected update to Nasa's forthcoming first launch of its new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft, a crewed mission could replace the currently planned uncrewed test flight (Ars Technica). A memo from acting Nasa administrator Robert Lightfoot says that, following feedback from new US president Donald Trump's Republican administration, he has ordered "a study to assess the feasibility of adding a crew to Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the first integrated flight of SLS and Orion" in order to fulfil Trump's inauguration promise to "unlock the mysteries of space." While the rocket's initial launch was scheduled for 2018, adding a crew to the flight would delay the mission until 2019 or 2020. The Orion spacecraft, which has so far been developed with uncrewed testing in mind, would also need some additional systems, but a Nasa engineer told Ars Technica that "if we started with EM-1 and added only what we needed, I don’t see why it wouldn’t work". 3. Verizon has dropped its offer for Yahoo by $250 million Reports from Bloomberg and Reuters indicate that US communications giant Verizon will reduce the price it's prepared to pay for Yahoo by between $250 and $350 million (The Verge). The revised offer follows revelations of two major data breaches - in 2013 and 2014 - that Yahoo had neglected to disclose during original negotiations. Verizon was originally to have acquired Yahoo for $4.83 billion, as per a plan announced in July 2016. 4. Startling air pollution maps reveal the true extent of rising emissions in the UK Data provided by UK-AIR, air quality information resources - Defra, UK and London Air Quality Network by the Environmental Research Group at King's College London - show pollution above ground in the United Kingdom regularly surpasses harmful levels (WIRED). At 8:00am on Tuesday, February 14, air quality levels in London were classed as 'unhealthy for sensitive groups', with an overall rating on the air quality index of 120. This data includes the amount of PM10's and PM2.5's in the air - microscopic particles of pollution that, once inhaled, create a number of respiratory and cardiovascular issues. On Monday, February 13, PM2.5 particles reached red levels, with a maximum of 154 on the AQI. At these levels, everyone "may experience health effects" with members of sensitive groups having "more serious" health complications. 2017 seems set to be a pivotal year for climate policy. The health effects of pollution are becoming more apparent, particularly in the United Kingdom. A study conducted by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health last year found that pollution is responsible for an estimated 40,000 deaths every year and its cost to health services is in excess of £20 billion annually. The report damns inactivity in regards to climate issues, stating that the health impact will only grow worse if immediate action isn't taken, saying, "Real change will only occur when everyone accepts this responsibility, and makes a concerted effort".

Watch India's record-breaking rocket deploy 104 satellites The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) yesterday, February 15, deployed a record 104 satellites into orbit in a single launch (Gizmodo). The complete official launch video shows each of the satellites being deployed from the four-stage Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. The payload included a large 714kg earth observation satellites, and 103 nano satellites, each weighing less than 10kg. ISRO chief Kiran Kumar told The Guardian that "we are just trying to maximise our capability with each launch and trying to utilise that launch for the ability it has got, and get the maximum in return". The previous record for most satellites deployed in a single launch was held by Russia, with 37 satellites.

Google launches TensorFlow 1.0 deep learning framework Google's open source TensorFlow deep learning framework for AIs has reached version 1.0, which means that it's now production ready (VentureBeat). The update was announced at Google's first TensorFlow Dev Summit, where new tools for the framework were also highlighted, giving it support for additional types of machine learning looks, including K-means and support vector machines (SVMs). Other updates including an experimental Java API and a debugging tool, all of which are likely to prompt even faster community development of the popular framework, which was launched in 2015.

New Pokémon are coming to Pokémon Go later this week Following months of rumours and reports, Niantic has officially announced an additional 80 Pokémon will begin to appear in Pokémon Go later this week (WIRED). These will include Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region from the Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver video games, including Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. Trainers will encounter these Pokémon “in the wild” and, in addition to Pokémon that will appear in the game for the first time, the latest update introduces new gameplay mechanics for Trainers to master, including new encounter gameplay, new Evolution items, two new Berries, and expanded outfit and accessory options for Trainer avatars. 9. Sony ends PlayStation Now support on PS3, Vita, TVs Sony has drastically reduced the scope of its PlayStation Now game streaming service, opting to focus all of its efforts on its PC and PS4 clients (GameSpot). This means that, on August 15, 2017, gamers who were using PS Now on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, all Sony Blu-ray players and most TVs will no longer be able to do so. Sony Bravia TVs released in 2016 will lose the service even sooner, on April 1 this year. PlayStation Now is an online subscription-based service allows users to play hundreds of PS3 games at a whim. Sony's Brian Dunn writes: "This move puts us in the best position to grow the service even further. If you use any of the above devices, we want to give our heartfelt thanks for your support, and we hope you’ll continue with us." 10. This animated film lovingly recreates software loading icons in stop-motion form London-based animator and director Raphael Vangelis has released a charming and colourful animated short inspired by the loading icons of dozens of software packages (Sploid). Analogue Loaders was created over about a year and a half, during which he used a 3D printer to painstakingly create each physical component of the stop-motion film. Vangelis writes that "I spend most of my life swearing at the computer because it's crashed or isn't working. Here, well known digital symbols are turned into something analogue and playful. The result is an homage to all the lost time we collectively spend in digital limbo in the hopes of sudden development on our screen." ADVERTISEMENT Popular on WIRED The refugee crisis captured in haunting detail using infrared cameras Military thermal imaging cameras are typically used for enemy location and targeting. Photographer Richard Mosse uses it to observe the migrant crisis. The Irish artist spent two years capturing the journeys of migrants into Europe using the camera, which can detect a human body from 30km and identify an individual from 6.3km. As the equipment is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, Mosse hired lawyers to obtain an export document for each trip. “The camera was designed to control borders and target the enemy,” says Mosse, 36, who lives in New York and County Clare, Ireland. “By using it to tell the refugee crisis, I'm putting viewers in a state of discomfort to disorient them.” WIRED​ ​01.17​ ​–​ ​on​ ​sale​ ​now This month we meet the Cambridge team taking on killer asteroids, rogue AIs and tyrannical leaders to protect us all from annihilation.

A report from Bloomberg has illuminated some of the work going on behind the scenes, but Huawei has already been upfront about its plans on this front. During CES in January, Huawei mobile chief Richard Yu told The Verge in a group briefing with other members of the press, including Bloomberg, that Huawei was planning a voice assistant only for its home market of China. In the United States and elsewhere, Huawei plans to pursue a path of least resistance through partnerships instead: "Today, Amazon and Google are stronger than us; Alexa and Google Assistant are better. How can we compete?" It would be unfair, therefore, to characterize what Huawei is now building as any sort of a competitor to Google and Amazon's offerings (which aren't available in China). Yu's expressed attitude is pragmatic, avoiding confrontation where he doesn't see a clear strength for his company. Instead, the Chinese voice assistant will be introduced to support an ecosystem of apps, games, and services that Huawei is already building in its native market.

The inquiry revolves around a famous Merkel quote. Watch video 01:25 Share Merkel to testify in NSA probe Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2Xf3A Merkel to testify in NSA probe Two quotes are associated with Angela Merkel's third term as chancellor. In the summer of 2015, when masses of refugees arrived in Germany, Merkel declared: "We can do this." The other famous statement she made referred to the revelation that the NSA had monitored her personal mobile phone: "Spying among friends - that is simply not done." If anyone searches the line in German on the internet, the Google results for the two lines differ greatly: There are about 1.6 million listings for the refugee policy quote and only 25,000 for the NSA scandal line. The great difference unexpectedly, but clearly, reflects the perceived public relevance of the two subjects. Refugees still play a large role - in politics and in everyday life. The fact that intelligence agencies systematically spy on private lives has more or less become a topic for experts. The uproar over Edward Snowden's revelations, more or less, dwindled down within a year. High-ranking witnesses The German NSA inquiry committee has been meeting for the past three years. No one seems to be interested in its work unless high-ranking witnesses appear, like former foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier; the former head of the chancellery, Ronald Pofalla; his successor, Peter Altmaier, or the former president of the foreign intelligence agency, the BND, Gerhard Schindler. Now, Merkel will contribute to the evidence being taken by the inquiry committee. After that, the final report will be written and it will contain the statements and comments made by over 100 witnesses and experts who have testified. The report must be completed by the second half of June. Altmeier, the head of the chancellory, already has the witness questioning behind him, unlike his boss, Merkel The name Merkel will probably appear often in this enormous work. Nonetheless, German members of parliament do not expect much from the chancellor's testimony. Why would she know more about NSA activities than her specialists? Last Monday it become clear how little they allegedly knew about tapping the phones of allies when secret service commissioner Klaus-Dieter Fritsche; Altmaier and Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert, expressed their views on the matter. How was Merkel's second most famous line meant? The actual or staged unawareness can summed up in one line. Klaus-Dieter Fritsche said: "If you do not have any clues to ask about, then you do not ask." Yet many questions are still unanswered. Who knew - and when - that the BND, and not just the NSA, eavesdropped on allies? Why did the chancellery not know about it? After all, it is responsible for supervising Germany's foreign intelligence service. Merkel must prepare for these questions when she takes the witness stand at the inquiry committee. Above all, the members of parliament want to know what she meant by: "Spying among friends - that is simply not done." Was it true indignation? Or was it a tactical move in the hope that the commotion would soon subside? The Social Democrats' chairman in the inquiry committee, Christian Flisek, suspects that Merkel had put up a "protection barrier" around herself in order to find out as little as possible about the behavior of intelligence agencies and that Fritsche was probably enlisted as her "personal firewall." However, Flisek had expected Merkel to make the NSA/BND affair a matter for the boss. The opposition also accuses the chancellor of lacking the will to solve the case. Ströbele at the first of many NSA investigation committee hearings in April 2014 Green Party member Hans-Christian Ströbele is firmly convinced that "Merkel had a lot of information." On the one hand, he hopes for "truth, clarity and credibility" when she takes the stand before the inquiry committee. On the other hand, he expects flimsy answers to his questions and the questions of other parliamentarians "because we are in an election campaign." That is what Ströbele suggested at the beginning of the NSA/BND affair a few months before German parliamentary elections in 2013. Merkel's then-head of the chancellery declared the whole affair to be over after a meeting of the Parliamentary Control Board for Secret Services. From the opposition's point of view, he wanted to keep information about the actual scale of the spying activities out of the election campaign. Whatever the motives were at that time, it seems like things went Merkel's way. The affair will be remembered for that one line. Martina Renner, chairwoman of the Left Party in the inquiry committee, is annoyed. She has called it one of the greatest intelligence scandals with minimal consequences. DW recommends Germany's BND spooks get new mission plan Germany's equivalent of the CIA, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), has been given a new set of tasks - three years too late.

It may need to address that, and soon. By Alex Webb and Alex Sherman. Added by Agency Staff on 16 February 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Beats, Google, Larry Page, McLaren, McLaren Technology Group, Microsoft, Netflix, Nokia, Sergey Brin, Tim Cook Tweet Apple CEO Tim Cook “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.” It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its US$246bn (R3,2 trillion) cash pile to meet ambitious sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks, and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3bn purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400m acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1bn, including its $22bn WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft has completed at least 10. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50bn by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50bn target, the company must find an extra $13bn in services revenue over the next four years — beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix ended 2016 with sales of less than $9bn, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney and electric car maker Tesla, Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55bn under management. The US presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tiptoed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions reshaping the technology industry. There’s a swagger — you may call it arrogance — about the culture there. They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics. When AT&T agreed to purchase Time Warner for $85bn in October, the telecommunications company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury car maker McLaren Technology Group, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26bn acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under chief business officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. The FBI wants in… That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring start-ups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger — you may call it arrogance — about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia’s handset business for $9,5bn, Microsoft had to write down $7,6bn of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60% in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60bn — 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal. “There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 26‘Please call me’ man hits back at Vodacom 10Big four banks’ dominance must end: Zuma 8Set-top box dispute goes to arbitration 7This is how we’re going to fix ICT 7Liquid Telecom’s big plans for Neotel Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Survey reveals SA's appetite for adult toys By Tmg Digital | 2017-02-16 10:02:32.0 Back to Home Tweet South Africans have an insatiable desire for sex toys.

Three-quarters of people who took part in the survey confirmed that they used sex toys. The survey was commissioned by Désir‚ an online adult shop for designer sex toys‚ after it emerged last year that South African’s had the third highest search volume for sex toys in the world‚ according to statistics from Google. Seven hundred people were polled on their perceptions about sex and toys. The biggest reason people gave for not using sex toys was because they were ignorant about the choices available and what sex toys could do for them‚ rather than being embarrassed or ashamed to use them. Other findings revealed that the main reason people gave for buying sex toys was to “spice up” their sex lives. Couples preferred to use toys together. When asked how often they used sex toys‚ 80.4% of respondents said they used them once a week or one to five times a month. The vibrator was a firm favourite when it came to the most frequently bought and used toy. Most people preferred to buy their kinky toys online‚ rather than walking into a brick and mortar store. “People want to be able to buy sex toys safely‚ in non-judgemental environments which aren’t associated with smut or porn. There is still so much shame around sexuality and sexual expression in South Africa‚ and it needs to change‚” said Désir CEO Brodie Meyer.

Really? 16 Feb 2017 at 07:01, Katyanna Quach Videos AI may be more human-like than people think. DeepMind’s latest research shows that once resources dwindle, the selfish instinct kicks in and virtual AI agents turn against each other, becoming aggressive to get what they want. The ugly side of human nature has been exposed in morality games like Prisoner’s Dilemma. In situations that require cooperation for mutual benefit, it’s tricky to get rational, self-interested people to join forces if there’s a possibility that the other party refuses to comply. Instead of Prisoner’s Dilemma, Google-owned DeepMind pitted two individual neural networks against each other in two scenarios: a fruit Gathering game and a Wolfpack hunting game. In the Gathering game, the two players appear as blue and red squares swarming over green squares that represent apples. When a player collects an apple, it receives a +1 reward and the green square disappears. After some time, a set of new apples respawns. Players can choose to fire a beam in a straight line along their path to “tag” the other player. If the blue player wanders into the beam twice, it is removed from the game for a number of frames, leaving the red player to take the apples, or vice versa. Motivated by the desire to snatch all the apples, each player attempts to kick the other out of the game by tagging. Youtube Video The game can be controlled by changing the number of apples and rates of respawning to test the agents’ tagging behaviors. The desire to eliminate the other player emerges “quite early” in the training and persists. As the players continue to learn and adapt to the changing environment, the frequency at which the beams are fired almost always increases. Things get ugly when there are fewer apples available. “Rather naturally, when there are enough apples in the environment, the agents learn to peacefully coexist and collect as many apples as they can. However, as the number of apples is reduced, the agents learn that it may be better for them to tag the other agent to give themselves time on their own to collect the scarce apples,” DeepMind wrote in a blog post. But for cleverer players – “agents with the capacity to implement more complex strategies” – it still chooses to be more hostile no matter how many apples were left in the game. In Wolfpack, the results are reversed. The game requires both players to hunt down prey. When a wolf successfully pounces on the prey, all wolves within the “capture radius” receive a reward. The prize is proportional to the number of wolves in the capture radius. “A lone wolf can capture the prey, but is at risk of losing the carcass to scavengers. However, when two wolves capture the prey together, they can better protect the carcass from scavengers and hence receive a higher reward,” the paper said. Youtube Video Unlike the Gathering game, it’s in both players’ interest to cooperate in Wolfpack. During gameplay, DeepMind researchers found that two cooperative strategies emerged. The players would either find each other and swoop into the prey together, or one would homes in on the prey and wait for the other to arrive before ambushing. It boils down to “temporal discounting” – people tend to disregard the rewards when they are so distant that it no longer becomes desirable. In Gathering, players are less likely to collaborate because although tagging the other player means the reward is delayed (each player takes turns gathering apples), it gives them an opportunity to collect more apples – or more rewards – without competition. When the number of apples respawns more quickly than they can be collected, the players don’t bother tagging, because more rewards can be earned by swooping in to take the apples. In Wolfpack, the risk of acting alone is greater than teaming up with another wolf, so delaying time to cooperate is advantageous. DeepMind is devoted to using games as a way to probe AI behavior. In this case, both games act as models to examine what strategies agents take in simulated environments. The key word here is “simulated.” It’s an interesting experiment, but not one that is extrapolated to the real world. In reality, humans and other animals have to consider complex social interactions with one another in order to achieve goals, but DeepMind’s simulated environment is too simple. Here, the two agents are independent of one another and “each regard the other as part of the environment.” “From the perspective of player one, the learning of player two shows up as a non-stationary environment. The independence assumption can be seen as a particular kind of bounded rationality: agents do no recursive reasoning about one another’s learning,” the paper said. But DeepMind believes that it may be used to “better understand and control complex multi-agent systems such as the economy, traffic systems, or the ecological health of our planet – all of which depend on our continued cooperation.” ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Yes.

No longer do they house in the basement but occupy a large space in Mondeal Square.

At least, that's according to Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet and former Google CEO. At the RSA security conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Schmidt spoke about the early days of his career building a network and mail system in the late 1970s while in a Masters program at the University of California, Berkeley. He touched on why internet security is still an ongoing issue, and why it's not completely secure by default. "We now find ourselves back fixing it over and over again," Schmidt said. "You keep saying, 'Why didn't we think about this?' Well the answer is, it didn't occur to us that there were criminals." Hacking, stealing information and data breaches are common problems, and many people still don't implement basic security features, such as strong passwords and two-factor authentication. And as more things become connected to the internet -- like TVs and fridges -- insecure gadgets in our home can be used as a network of bots that can take down major websites. Schmidt has said before that he and other early internet pioneers forgot to consider people who might use it for nefarious purposes. But internet companies still struggle to account for all the ways people might use their platforms. Twitter, a way to send 140-character blasts about what you're eating for breakfast, morphed into a platform that elevates millions of voices, including harassers, racists and people inciting violence. The social media company was late on reacting to this behavior, and it's still trying to wrestle with its ethos of supporting free speech and policing harmful behavior. Facebook, too, has experienced consequences its founders likely didn't predict when launching as a platform for college students to connect. Fake news proliferates so much that the company now has to let users know what they're reading is false. And despite founder Mark Zuckerberg denying Facebook is a media company, it's evolved to be a key distributor of news and information, including launching its own video apps this week. As the Internet and companies built upon it continue to be used in new, unexpected ways, builders must account for behaviors outside of their own. No one will create a problem-free network. But by listening to and implementing diverse perspectives into the services people build, it may be possible to stop bad behavior before it affects literally everyone who uses the service.

Then-14-year-old went on to take the world by a storm with mega hits. His name is Justin Drew Bieber. Since Bieber’s rise to superstardom, a flurry of YouTube stars looking to move beyond their 15 minutes of fame have been flocking to the largest video-streaming website in the world. Amateur artists broadcasting their content on YouTube pose in this photo taken Wednesday at Google Campus Seoul. (YouTube) A group of Korean amateur musicians gaining popularity via the platform -- calling themselves “music creators” -- met with reporters in Seoul to talk about transforming their 15 minutes of fame into a lasting reputation as artists. “At first I thought, ‘Who’d want to watch me sing?’ but my friends persuaded me to upload the videos,” said YouTuber Jfla, whose real name is Kim Jung-hwa. Her channel uploads the cover songs along with songs she has written herself. Kim’s channel has surpassed 470,000 subscriptions, and she is currently looking to make an official debut as a singer in England. For years, internet celebrities in Korea have been using a variety of broadcasting platforms, including Afreeca TV that allows users to stream videos while chatting with fans in real-time. But YouTube broadcasters say that the platform’s international distribution has an edge over its competitors. About 90 percent of Kim’s viewers originate from outside Korea, while some 70 percent of Lee Raon’s viewership is from other countries. Lee, whose YouTube name is Raon, said she was able to reach fans of the Japanese pop culture by covering songs from popular animations. “When (the fans) search the tracks from animations, my name would pop up...But I intentionally add variations (to the song) which is why I think they end up liking my covers,” she said. Unlike Kim or other YouTube singers, Lee’s previous life had little to do with music; she was a certified dental hygienist. “I wondered what I really wanted to do. I wanted to try something that I really like, while I was still young,” she said. Lee started recording at home with a 20,000 won ($17) microphone. Lee, who recently quit her job as a hygienist, said she wishes to expand the scope of her work and hold offline performances outside the country as well. “I think the best thing about internet broadcasting is that even someone who is not a professional can do it. I urge anyone who wants to be an artist to try,” she said. According to a YouTube official, the company offers an online community from which beginner-level users can get information. At the YouTube creator hub, the company invites more experienced YouTube creators to help out others just getting started. When one’s channel reaches 100,000 subscribers, a manager from YouTube is matched with the creator to offer counsel.

Biotech Since the early 2000s, the cost of sequencing a human genome — determining the precise order of nucleotides within DNA molecules that defines who we are — has dropped sharply. A genome that cost $100m to sequence in 2001 can today be sequenced for roughly $1,000. This plummeting cost, along with the shortened timescales for sequencing DNA, has led to a revolution in biotechnology: gene hacking, or the ability to turn genes on and off, and to manipulate biology to our advantage. The most radical branch of this new technology is “gene editing” — a process by which our DNA code can be cut and pasted using molecular “scissors” for a variety of applications, including curing diseases such as cancers and HIV. Until recently, swapping the code was an arduous process. A new DNA cut-and-paste tool known as Crispr has made the process unexpectedly simple. Crispr has been used to create disease-resistant strains of wheat and rice, alter yeast to make biofuels and reverse blindness in animals. Ultimately, it could be used to edit defects out of human embryos. 2. Artificial intelligence © HANDOUT Artificial intelligence is not science fiction: it is already embedded in products we use every day. Apple’s Siri assistant, Amazon’s book recommendations, Facebook’s news feed and Spotify’s music discovery playlist are all examples of services driven by machine learning algorithms. This decades-old science is enjoying a renaissance today because of the deluge of data created by smartphones and sensors, and the supercomputing power that is available to crunch that data. According to technology research firm Tractica, the AI market will grow from $643.7m in 2016 to $36.8bn by 2025. Techniques such as deep learning and neural networks supposedly mimic the human brain: they spot broad patterns in enormous data sets in order to label images, recognise voices and make decisions. The next step is artificial general intelligence: an algorithm that will not have to be taught a specific skill such as a game of chess or a new language, but will acquire it through trial and error, just as a child does. Companies such as London-based DeepMind, owned by Google, and others are working to make this a reality. 3. Renewable energy World leaders last year ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change. This aims to keep the global average temperature from rising more than 2C above pre-industrial levels and to attempt to keep the increase under 1.5C. Keeping this promise will require more renewable energy research over the next decade. In energy, researchers are trying to build a nuclear fusion reactor that would tap the same process that causes the sun to give off light and heat to create a source of clean energy. An intergovernmental partnership is building a $19bn fusion reactor, ITER, in France. Other innovations include artificial photosynthesis to make hydrocarbons in laboratories to power cars, and high-altitude wind power that involves kites and hot-air balloons acting as aerial wind turbines. Iceland is investing in geothermal technology, drilling for heat energy underground. Thirty years ago it started by using geothermal resources to heat towns and cities. Now, the entire country’s electricity and heating systems are powered almost fully by renewable energy, including geothermal and hydropower. 4. Connectivity © Getty WiFi — a household staple that modern children take for granted — turned 25 last September. As more objects connect to the “internet of things” — an estimated 50bn of them by 2020, according to estimates from technology company Cisco — the future of WiFi lies in reducing the power it drains from internet-enabled devices. One innovation, invented by students at the University of Washington in Seattle, is known as “passive WiFi” which its inventors say consumes 10,000 times less power. It is currently slower than regular home broadband, but would work well for applications such as smart thermostats or lightbulbs. The WiFi community is also looking to develop higher-frequency bands that would be used over a limited range, such as in a house or car. Ultimately, WiFi itself could be replaced by a new superfast alternative called Li-Fi, which uses light to beam information through the air, instead of radio waves. Lightbulbs would act as routers for this technology. A pilot study earlier this year found that a Li-Fi prototype could send data 100 times faster than WiFi, allowing dozens of movies to be downloaded in minutes. 5. Smart appliances © Reuters Almost two-thirds of the human population is connected to the internet via smartphones, but these devices are not the only portal to the web. In 2016 there were 6.4bn connected things — excluding PCs, phones and tablets — in use worldwide, up 30 per cent from the previous year, according to technology analyst Gartner. The internet of things, as it is known, is this universe of objects — everything from cars to printers, lightbulbs to thermostats — that are no longer “dumb”, static things: they can learn your habits and be controlled remotely using an app. The stereotypical smart appliance is the self-stocking refrigerator that replenishes your milk automatically. This innovation will replace a lot more than the sniff test. Cars are now computers, running more lines of code than the Apollo 11 spaceship on its way to the moon. As these computers become more intelligent, cars will drive themselves, potentially reducing traffic-related fatalities. Smart sensors can also transform industry, for instance by monitoring goods during transport, helping utility companies to measure energy usage and logistics companies to track vehicles over long distances.

And while we don't have specifics on an Australian price or availability, we're starting to get an idea of what AMD's new CPU will look like. The details have since been taken down, but for a brief period Belgian electronics retailer Centralpoint had them online. A cache of the page is still available on Google, however. Digital Trends spotted the listing first, so kudos to them. And if you like their information in a slightly more readable form, here's the full details of what was posted: AMD Ryzen R7 1800X: 8 cores, 16 threads, 3.6GHz base speed, 4.0GHz boost speed, 16MB L3 Cache, 95W TDP R7 1800 Pro: 8 cores, 16 threads, 16MB L3 Cache, 95W TDP, rest unstated R7 1700X: 8 cores, 16 threads, 3.4 GHz base speed, 3.8 GHz boost speed, 16MB L3 Cache, 95W TDP R7 1700: 65W TDP, rest unstated R7 1700 Pro: 8 cores, 16 threads, 3.0GHz base speed, 3.7GHz boost speed, 16MB L3 Cache, 65W TDP The R7 1700 and the R7 1800 Pro presumably have the same base/boost speeds as the X-named variants, although for now we'll leave that one as unconfirmed. Digital Trends also got details on the four and six-core Ryzen R5 chips, as well as the entry level quad-core R3 CPUs. Some synthetic benchmarks featuring Ryzen have leaked online over the last couple of weeks, but the real interesting part will be when games start to get involved. Expect to see more of that pop up in the next week or so. Early March isn't far away now. Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

There is now a recognition that AI will disrupt how societies operate, from education and employment to how data will be collected about people. Machine learning, a form of advanced pattern recognition that enables machines to make judgments by analysing large volumes of data, could greatly supplement human thought. But such soaring capabilities have stirred almost Frankenstein-like fears about whether developers can control their creations. Failures of autonomous systems — like the death last yearof a US motorist in a partially self-driving car from Tesla Motors — have led to a focus on safety, says Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science and AI expert at the University of California, Berkeley. “That kind of event can set back the industry a long way, so there is a very straightforward economic self-interest here,” he says. Alongside immigration and globalisation, fears of AI-driven automation are fuelling public anxiety about inequality and job security. The election of Donald Trump as US president and the UK’s vote to leave the EU were partly driven by such concerns. While some politicians claim protectionist policies will help workers, many industry experts say most jobs losses are caused by technological change, largely automation. Global elites — those with high income and educational levels, who live in capital cities — are considerably more enthusiastic about innovation than the general population, the FT/Qualcomm Essential Future survey found. This gap, unless addressed, will continue to cause political friction. Vivek Wadhwa, a US-based entrepreneur and academic who writes about ethics and technology, thinks the new wave of automation has geopolitical implications: “Tech companies must accept responsibility for what they’re creating and work with users and policymakers to mitigate the risks and negative impacts. They must have their people spend as much time thinking about what could go wrong as they do hyping products. The industry is bracing itself for a backlash. Advances in AI and robotics have brought automation to areas of white-collar work, such as legal paperwork and analysing financial data. Some 45 per cent of US employees’ work time is spent on tasks that could be automated with existing technologies, a study by McKinsey says. Industry and academic initiatives have been set up to ensure AI works to help people. These include the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society, established by companies including IBM, and a $27m effort involving Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Groups like Open AI, backed by Elon Musk and Google, have made progress, says Prof Russell: “We’ve seen papers . . . that address the technical problem of safety.” There are echoes of past efforts to deal with the complications of a new technology. Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, compares it to 15 years ago when Bill Gates rallied his company’s developers to combat computer malware. His “trustworthy computing” initiative was a watershed moment. In an interview with the FT, Mr Nadella said he hoped to do something similar to ensure AI works to benefit humans. AI presents some thorny problems, however. Machine learning systems derive insights from large amounts of data. Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft executive, told a US Senate hearing late last year that these data sets may themselves be skewed. “Many of our data sets have been collected . . . with assumptions we may not deeply understand, and we don’t want our machine-learned applications . . . to be amplifying cultural biases,” he said. Last year, an investigation by news organisation ProPublica found that an algorithm used by the US justice system to determine whether criminal defendants were likely to reoffend, had a racial bias. Black defendants with a low risk of reoffending were more likely than white ones to be labelled as high risk. Greater transparency is one way forward, for example making it clear what information AI systems have used. But the “thought processes” of deep learning systems are not easy to audit.Mr Horvitz says such systems are hard for humans to understand. “We need to understand how to justify [their] decisions and how the thinking is done.” As AI comes to influence more government and business decisions, the ramifications will be widespread. “How do we make sure the machines we ‘train’ don’t perpetuate and amplify the same human biases that plague society?” asks Joi Ito, director of MIT’s Media Lab. Executives like Mr Nadella believe a mixture of government oversight — including, by implication, the regulation of algorithms — and industry action will be the answer. He plans to create an ethics board at Microsoft to deal with any difficult questions thrown up by AI. He says: “I want . . . an ethics board that says, ‘If we are going to use AI in the context of anything that is doing prediction, that can actually have societal impact . . . that it doesn’t come with some bias that’s built in.’” Making sure AI systems benefit humans without unintended consequences is difficult. Human society is incapable of defining what it wants, says Prof Russell, so programming machines to maximise the happiness of the greatest number of people is problematic. This is AI’s so-called “control problem”: the risk that smart machines will single-mindedly pursue arbitrary goals even when they are undesirable. “The machine has to allow for uncertainty about what it is the human really wants,” says Prof Russell. Ethics committees will not resolve concerns about AI taking jobs, however. Fears of a backlash were apparent at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos as executives agonised over how to present AI. The common response was to say machines will make many jobs more fulfilling though other jobs could be replaced. The profits from productivity gains for tech companies and their customers could be huge. How those should be distributed will become part of the AI debate. “Whenever someone cuts cost, that means, hopefully, a surplus is being created,” says Mr Nadella. “You can always tax surplus — you can always make sure that surplus gets distributed differently.” Additional reporting by Adam Jezard Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 1:19 PM Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts by alex webbandalex sherman Unique challenges: Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. — Reuters “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple Inc chief executive officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.”  It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its US$246bil (RM1.09tril) cash pile to meet ambitions sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation.  But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations.  “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.  Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the US$3bil (RM13.37bil) purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the US$400mil (RM1.78bil) acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least US$1bil (RM4.44bil), including its US$22bil (RM98.05bil) WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top US$50bil (RM222.85bil) by 2021.  But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video.  On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its US$50bil (RM222.85bil) target, the company must find an extra US$13bil (RM57.94bil) in services revenue over the next four years – beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc ended 2016 with sales of less than US$9bil (RM40.11bil), so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said.  Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co and electric carmaker Tesla Inc, Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients.  “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its US$55bil (RM245.13bil) under management.  The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry.   When AT&T Inc agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc for US$85bil (RM378.84bil) in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough.  Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer.  Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process.  Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its US$26bil (RM115.88bil) acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc and Facebook.  At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under chief business officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.  Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said.  That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult.  “There’s a swagger – you may call it arrogance – about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.”  For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team.  Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for US$9.5bil (RM42.34bil), Microsoft had to write down US$7.6bil (RM33.87bil) of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking.  That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60% in the past year, giving it a market value of more than US$60bil (RM267.42bil) – 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal.  ”There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: M&A , Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Toshiba to delay chip business sale to next year: Kyodo China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Jaguar fuels in-car innovation with its latest app Toshiba shares tumble as bigger stake in chip unit likely up for sale Facebook shutters hundreds of Oculus VR demo stations at Best Buy stores Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Others Also Read Made to match an active lifestyle Places to go on a weekend Spanish giants to host coaching clinics at college in Negri Sembilan advertisement Latest News Bank Negara to work closely with Cabinet on forex losses Carpool and save with GrabShare DBS profit slumps to two-year low on oil and gas bad debts Maybank Indonesia posts record earnings in FY16 Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Carpool and save with GrabShare Stand up to cancer Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

I’ve received over 300 photos in the mail for free, just by paying shipping and handling and using an app from the Google Play Store. Advertisement So without further delay, this is how you too can print photos right from your Android smartphone or tablet. Print Photos With a Home Printer As long as you have a decent printer, or better yet a photo printer, doing this at home is a breeze. The results might not be the best but it’s one of the easiest options for most. You’ll want a photo printer, photo paper (I prefer matte over glossy) and preferably some special photo ink. Next all we need is to use one of the many different apps and services available. First up is Google Cloud Print, but we’ve had mixed results using it. Download the dedicated Google Cloud Print app, and follow the steps to connect it to a printer. There are Cloud Print enabled printers available to buy, but regular old wired printers work just fine too. Once they are connected simply hit the “Share” button on any photo, share it to Google Cloud Print, and you’re all done. It’s pretty easy. Advertisement However, we’d recommend a few other options first as the results have been iffy at best using Google’s service. Instead, most printers have either WiFi or Bluetooth by default, and will work in seconds. Alternatively, many WiFi printers will have options to let owners quickly email photos from their phone right to it. Then, just edit or print them at will. Using the built-in share feature on Android owners can share photos to a Printer in a slew of different ways. Not to mention most popular brands have their own dedicated applications for exactly that. I use HP ePrint, but other companies have similar solutions. Here’s a list. Download HP ePrint Brother iPrint & Scan Epson iPrint Canon Print Service even manufacturers like Samsung Cloud Print All of the applications above can be found on the Google Play Store (or just click our links) and are extremely easy to use. Just follow the instructions, pair a printer to a mobile device, and print on the fly. Some even work when you aren’t home or on the same WiFi connection. Advertisement Above is a screenshot showing how easy it is open a photo and hit share, send a photo to HP ePrint, and print a photo from an Android smartphone in seconds. Their application is dead simple to use, has some decent editing tools, and works every time for me. Give any of the apps above a try today or read on for other options. Print Photos Locally If you don’t plan on printing photos often, or don’t have a good quality printer, use local stores instead. Of course anyone can walk into Walmart and print photos with a little Kiosk, but other much better options are readily available. The first thing that comes to mind is the app Kicksend. It will find nearby stores like Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Target, FedEx Kinkos and other locations. Right from the application you can upload as many or as few as you’d like, and get them printed and ready for pick-up the same day. Kodak has a similar app for finding a Kiosk to print from, and the Walgreen’s app has a photo upload option. Find what’s best for you, and get started. Then just pick-up your photos whenever they’re ready. Upload Photos and Have Them Delivered Last but not least, is probably the best option of all. Surely many of you have seen the commercials for popular services like Shutterfly, especially around Valentine’s Day. These apps essentially allow users to upload endless amounts of photos right from our Android smartphones or tablets. Choose the photo size, special options like gifts or fridge magnets, and get them printed and delivered right to your door. Often times completely free. Advertisement In fact, the Kicksend app mentioned above has this option too. They recommend using their paid print service and have the photos delivered, rather than picking them up locally. Our first recommendation would by Shutterfly. Simply download the app and get unlimited free prints in 4×6 or 4×4 prints. Just pay for shipping. A few of my photos had the tops cut-off, but getting over 300 photos for free is too good to pass up. Shutterfly has good quality prints, and tons of gift options. Like candles, cup coasters, fridge magnets and much more. Not to mention the unlimited free 4×6 are perfect for photo albums or scrap-booking. Alternatively, we’d also recommend users check out Mpix, Snapfish or FreePrints. All of these have easy to use apps that allow us to print photos from Android smartphones or tablets. Send some as a gift, get photos delivered to your door and more. All for a low fee. Of course at the end of the day you could just transfer photos from any device to your computer, and print them yourself. Or add them to a USB thumb drive and take it to any local store for quick quality prints. There are multiple options available these days, so choose what’s right for you. For those wondering, all of these options work great on the iPhone too. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

New York City second most expensive place on the planet to rent behind San Francisco The Big Apple is the second most expensive city to rent behind San Francisco Both are more expensive than the most expensive place to rent internationally: Hong Kong A single New Yorker will on average pay $1,994 a month; a family $3,783 a month  By Kiri Blakeley For Dailymail.com Published: 01:09 EST, 16 February 2017 | Updated: 01:19 EST, 16 February 2017 e-mail 13 shares 7 View comments New York City is known as the city that never sleeps, and maybe that's because people are worried about their rent. The skyscraper city is the second most expensive city for renters in the world, according to a new report. London-based real estate brokerage Nested says that New York is only slightly behind San Francisco as the most financially onerous to renters. New York City (above) is the second most expensive city in the world, behind San Francisco NYC's distinct neighborhoods, such as Chinatown, above, make it a popular place to live San Francisco's homes are beautiful - but not cheap. The city is the most expensive place to rent in the US A New York City apartment on average will cost a family $3,783 a month The country's tech capital, San Francisco, is the most expensive city for renters The average monthly rental for a single New Yorker is $1,994 and its $3,783 for a family, says the report. That's only slightly behind San Francisco, where rents have skyrocketed thanks to being a tech hub, home to hundreds of technology companies including Google, eBay and Apple (Facebook is an hour away in Menlo Park).  If you're a single person in the city of angels, you'll pay on average $2,077.96 a month. A family will have to shell out $3,942.82 a month. Rents are $4.95 per square foot for San Francisco and $4.75 for New York City.  Boston, above, home to Harvard, is the third most expensive city to rent  Washington DC, the capital and political hub, is the third most expensive city  New York has long been known for its sky high rents, with people renting out apartments that are little bigger than large closets for prices that would bring them a house elsewhere in the country.  The city's steep rental prices have no doubt been fueled by the many industries people come here to work in, including fashion, retail, finance, entertainment, media and technology. Seattle,  Prices for former second-class cousin borough Brooklyn have also soared in the past couple of decades.  If the rent in New York City is too damn high, rounding out the top five are college town Boston, political mecca Washington, DC, and progressive haven Seattle. After that comes Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and Houston. Rounding out the top ten is Detroit, which despite all of the negative press it's gotten lately for its soaring crime, beat out cities like Austin, Atlanta, Portland, and Philadelphia. Globally, the most expensive city was Hong Kong, followed by Dubai, Singapore, Geneva and Sydney. Of the fifty cities listed, Barcelona, Spain was the cheapest place to rent.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 13 shares Most watched News videos Moment ISIS suicide attacker detonates bomb near Syrian rebels Dog CRIES after being told off for chewing sofa into pieces Redback spider catches brown snake in it's web and attacks it Terrifying moment deadly Chicago ambush captured on Facebook live Shocking moment a model poses on the ledge of very tall skyscraper Social Experiment: Would you breastfeed a stranger's baby?

Chinese soldiers would marshal forces to protect the Great Wall from enemy attack by using smoke signals to send alerts from tower to tower. This method of alerting enabled messages to be sent to garrisons hundreds of miles away in just a few hours time. With these alerts, soldiers could prepare to convene and combat their enemies. How can teams effectively analyze this vast amount of data from their various systems? How can they use this data to troubleshoot issues when they do arrive? How can they use this data to prepare for the IT dangers they know of and those that are unforeseen? Furthermore, how can they make sure they are alerted when serious issues and even dangers arrive? Why Is Log Analysis Important for IT Teams? While most developers and DevOps teams believe in the importance of log analysis, they consider it akin to eating spinach — it’s good for you, but do you really have to do it? While log analysis contains a lot of important information on how the system is behaving, analyzing logs is a lot of work. However, avoiding this analysis is dangerous. Without this careful analysis, a company cannot recognize the threats and opportunities that lie before it. Most companies run off multiple servers and have numerous devices providing logs to inform them about troubleshooting issues, monitoring, business intelligence, and SEO. Furthermore, as written in a previous article, IT infrastructure continues its move to public clouds such as Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. As such, it becomes more difficult to isolate issues — and since there is a lot of fluctuation of server usage in the cloud based on the specific loads, environments, and the number of active users, obtaining an accurate reading can become quite difficult. Yet by centralized log analysis, you have a way to normalize the data in one database and acquire a sense of how the system’s “normal state” operates. Log analysis can provide insight into cloud-based services as well as localized systems. The analysis provides the knowledge of how the network looks when it is humming along. Knowing baseline traffic, companies then have a sense of how to view the outliers. What should our site traffic be like? What error logs are normal and consistent with system traffic and which are causes for alarm? Having answers to these questions enables engineers to make data-informed decisions. Furthermore, logs and log analysis can provide insight into many key points of information throughout deployment. Analytics can be used to understand system logs, web server logs, error logs, and app logs. Logs provide us with a way to see traffic, incidents, or events over time. By including log analysis as part of healthy system monitoring, the seemingly impossible process of reading logs and responding to their information becomes possible. By enabling log analysis, companies can optimize and debug system performance and give essential inputs around bottlenecks in the system. Where Does ELK Come in? There are several software packages out there that provide log analysis capabilities. Some large enterprises use packages such as Splunk and Sumo Logic. Yet these packages can get quite expensive at high scale. Instead, many in the DevOps community have moved towards using the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack for their log analysis. ELK components can be used separately, but when joined together, they give users the ability to run log analysis on top of open sourced software that everyone can run for free. ELK has many advantages over competitors. It is open source, is easy to set up, and provides fast performance. Of additional value is the visibility it offers into the overall IT stack. When numerous servers are running multiple applications as well as virtual machines, you need a way to easily view and analyze problems. ELK provides this opportunity in a low-cost way that correlates metrics with logs. Example of ELK Solutions One of the biggest challenges of building an ELK deployment is making it scalable. Given a new product deployment or upgrade, traffic and downloads to a site might conceivably skyrocket. Ensuring this influx doesn’t kill the system requires that all components of the ELK stack scale as well. Ideally, you would have a tool which combines these three components into a viable stack that is integrated into the cloud so that scaling and security are taken care of. This is where a hosted ELK solution like Logz.io or Elastic Cloud steps in. Logz.io is built on top of Amazon’s AWS and enables this very type of scaling. Additionally, when running a large environment, problems can originate from the network and cause an interruption in the application. Trying to correlate these issues can be very complicated and time-consuming. The ELK stack is useful in these cases because it provides a method to bring in data from multiple sources and create rich visualizations.

The annual income from “the 10% vig,” oops, tax — estimated to be close to $1 trillion by the end of President Barack Obama’s second term — would nearly wipe out the current budget deficit. State and local casino and lottery operations would not affected by the new national legislation. Code named “You Bet Your Ass,” the concept was conceived in a late night drinking and strategy session in May when it seemed obvious to the president’s senior advisors that a second dip of the economy was all but inevitable. As the fifth fifth of Talisker scotch — the current beverage of choice in Washington — was passed around the table, the always mild-mannered chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, slurred the battle cry of the forthcoming campaign: “I’ll give you 10:1 odds that we kick the shit out of those MF’s in 2012.” At that moment, Moshe Peddler, the senior partner of Peddler and Marconi Communications and the president’s outside media maven, felt he had been hit by a thunderbolt. Nevertheless, it took him all night to put the pieces together: that “10:1 odds” phrase, combined with a lifetime of peddling crap, meant federal control and the “taxing” of online gambling. A quick Google search revealed that it was already legal in some major European countries. Internet gambling was coming. The only question was who would control it: the casino operators or Uncle Sam? Today, the Democrats had control of Congress and maybe they could ram it through. After the elections, who knew? Using $200,000 of his company’s political slush funds, Peddler went right to work: grassroots call-ins the next morning to 2,500 radio stations, followed up by in-depth research. That evening, 3,547 land line and cell phone surveys were conducted on two key issues: First, 73% wanted internet gambling; and, second, the public didn’t give a damn who controlled it, as long as they got to play an honest game of Texas Hold? Em. The next morning, Moshe, Rahm and the President sat down for a super secret meeting. Everyone else was banished. Even the secret recording system was shut down. In five minutes, Moshe presented his plan, his research, the preliminary numbers from the budget office and his findings. The chief of staff was so happy he danced on nine fingers. Maybe he would stay the full term after all. The president was another story. Obviously, he’d piss off the religious right and the casino owners. But they were leaning GOP anyway. If Peddler’s numbers were right, he’d come close to wiping out the budget deficit. He figured that plus health care might make him the fifth face on Mt. Rushmore. Peddler read his boss’ face. He was the best closer on the planet, and went in for the kill like Tyson in his prime. “Mr. President, did you know that England and France have already legalized Internet gambling? Denmark has finished its legislation and Germany, Switzerland and Spain are goose-stepping to be next in line. We either try to regulate and tax it, or people are going to go to the offshore operators, where you don’t get any revenue.” The president was sold. “Rahm,” said the now beaming Obama, “alert all the cable and networks for a major address for Sunday at nine. And make sure those budget numbers are right. “Finally, we need a slogan. Something like: Game On.” Bill Regardie was the founder and publisher of Regardie’s Magazine.

Is virtual reality what comes next? by Ty Burr February 16, 2017 Would you watch a virtual-reality Casablanca? The question is ridiculous, but usefully so. VR will never be like the movies, culturally or aesthetically, and the best way to understand why may be to imagine you’re experiencing the 1942 Warner Brothers classic not as a linear story viewed from a theater seat, but as an immersive world accessed by a digital headset. Most of us would never leave Rick’s Café Américain. We’d go behind the bar with Sascha, hover by Emil the croupier at the roulette table, hang out with Sam as he played “As Time Goes By” again. Me, I’d be following Peter Lorre’s sniveling Ugarte. But the central drama of Rick’s rekindled love and sacrifice for Ilsa Lund? We’d probably never get that far. Director Michael Curtiz and the Warner Brothers elves did such a brilliant job imagining the world of Casablanca that we’d be content to explore it until we bumped up against the walls, like Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. Similarly, a virtual-reality Citizen Kane might be a survey of the title character’s infinite basement, each talisman sparking its own flashback in no particular order. The Godfather VR Edition might allow us to prowl the haunted house of Don Corleone’s extended family, with the drama of Michael’s slow rise and rot only one small thread amid the warp and weft. VR will never become the new cinema. Instead, it will be a different thing. But what is that thing? And will audiences trained in passive linear narrative—where scene follows scene like beads on a string, and the string always pulls us forward—appreciate what the thing might be? Or will we only recognize it when the new medium has reached a certain maturity, the way audiences in 1903 sat up at The Great Train Robbery and recognized that, finally, here was a movie? As a movie critic and a writer who has been covering film over 35 years, I recognize that I’m part of a vast viewership beholden to a media format that has passed its apogee: the roughly two-hour visual experience, usually narrative, projected on a screen for multiple viewers. We live in a time of cultural and technological upheaval, and traditional cinema was the art form of the 20th century. Distribution points are multiplying (TV, computer, phone) while viewing lengths run from binge-watched multi-hour TV episodes to 10-second Snapchats. Things Reviewed Notes on Blindness free for Samsung Gear or Google Cardboard Dear Angelica free for Oculus Invisible free for most head-mounted displays on the Jaunt channel Remembering Pearl Harbor free for the Vive Paul McCartney: Early Days free on the Jaunt channel The Rose and I free for most head-mounted displays from Penrose Studios Allumette free from Penrose Studios Once a technological Holy Grail or the province of science fiction films like Brainstorm (1983), The Lawnmower Man (1992), The Matrix (1999), and Avatar (2009), virtual-reality technology was for years bedeviled by image-rendering glitches and the vertigo that can afflict users trying to navigate a poorly created virtual space. It’s hard to enjoy a fantasy world when you feel you’re about to throw up. But now the future may finally be here. Consumer-ready VR helmets like the Oculus Rift, the Samsung Gear V12, Sony PlayStation VR, and the HTC Vive plunge viewers into immersive 3-D environments where they can move within a storyline or game space without feeling sick. They’re the newest iterations of headsets that have been around for decades (I tested the CyberMaxx helmet for Entertainment Weekly way back in 1994), and they all descend from the first head-mounted display unit developed by computer scientist Ivan Sutherland in 1968, a behemoth so heavy that it was bolted to the ceiling and nicknamed the “Sword of Damocles.” Meanwhile, content creators—visual artists and game developers, filmmakers and other storytellers—are trying to figure out how it might work. (See an interview with Google’s principal filmmaker for VR, Jessica Brillhart.) Gaming software and networks represent the most fertile and obvious center of development, since exploring and interacting with a fictional reality is the plot of most video games. Other, more narrative virtual-­reality experiences, available for purchase or free in the online VR stores that serve as visual entry points once you put on the Rift, the Gear, or the Vive, feel remarkably fresh. They point the way forward toward … something. Sometimes that something can be startlingly beautiful. The 20-minute Notes on Blindness: Into the Darkness was much praised at the now-annual virtual-reality sidebar at the Sundance Film Festival last year, and it went on to win festival prizes throughout 2016. Based on the diaries of the late John Hull, a British writer and editor who lost his sight at age 45, Notes uses Hull’s recorded voice as guide to an otherworld: a 360° panoramic London park, ink-black except for silhouetted outlines, that is illuminated by each sound we hear. A passing jogger’s feet seem to bioluminesce with every clip-clop; the wind through the trees brings imagined color to branches and leaves. An entire landscape of synesthesia comes into being before our eyes and ears. Yes, it would and does work on a rectangular film or TV screen, but not nearly as convincingly as this immersive inner-yet-outer experience. These are beguiling visions, evidence of new ways of expressing human experiences, owing little to other media. Even more striking is Dear Angelica, a highlight of this January’s Sundance VR showcase. Directed by Saschka Unseld and developed in the skunk works of Oculus Story Studio, it’s a memory play told from the point of view of a young woman, voiced by Mae Whitman, as she reminisces about her late mother, a larger-than-life film actress, voiced by Geena Davis. As with Notes on Blindness, there’s no attempt to capture a photographic reality; rather, the artist Wesley Allsbrook has used the Quill VR illustration software, developed at Story Studio, to create a vivid impressionistic flow of color that evolves around, behind, and even beneath a viewer. Dear Angelica does move forward in linear fashion, but it doesn’t tell a story so much as unfold like a poignant train of thought, and you can sense the filmmakers taking baby steps toward a new visual and psychological grammar. These are beguiling visions, evidence of new ways of expressing human experiences, owing little to other media. Yet there are still stumbling blocks. For one thing, VR hardware is still very clumsy. You have to put on the headset, set up the movement tracking devices, log on to the computer, and avoid tripping over all those cords as you grope blindly about the rec room. It is as if Thomas Edison had told everyone that they needed to rewire their homes and assemble the projectors themselves if they ever wanted to watch a motion picture—and that they then had to put the projector on over their heads. Most virtual-reality experiences that attempt to combine the narrative forward momentum of film with the immersive exploration of VR end up highlighting the worst of both mediums. Compared with the promise of Notes on Blindness and Dear Angelica, these “entertainments” represent the current reality of virtual reality, and it’s worth talking about what they are and how you experience them. The experiences are different on different headsets. Google Cardboard, an appealingly low-entry headset, lets you play VR content on an iPhone or Android phone slotted into a cardboard box; it’s the VR equivalent of a Victorian stereoscope or a later generation’s GAF ­View-Master, and while it’s funky and the visuals can get mighty pixelated, it works. The Oculus Rift, available at electronics outlets for about $600 (hand controls are an additional $200), offers vastly improved visual resolution but requires a PC system with state-of-the-art graphic capability (at least $880) and a decent amount of technical savvy to use. The more recently arrived HTC Vive has all that plus a pair of laser sensors that have to be precisely positioned on your walls so that the user’s movements can be accurately tracked. (The Rift has a similar sensor that stands on a tabletop and looks like a microphone but isn’t.) I didn’t test-drive the Samsung Gear or other headsets for this article. What are we able to dream while wearing these brave new goggles? In the virtual stores encountered once you put on the headsets—visual malls that seem to hover in space—you can pay for, collect, and access games, apps, social-media platforms, and a lot of what could be termed short VR programming, little of which is terribly interesting. You can watch brief comic skits—YouTube product busted out into 3-D—and travelogues that reinforce the View-Master comparison. Doug Liman, the director of such Hollywood hits as Swingers (1996) and The Bourne Identity (2002), has produced and co-directed a VR series called Invisible for Jaunt, a VR production company and online store. In five episodes of about six minutes each, a clunky thriller storyline about invisible cousins comes to grief on soap-opera-level acting, dreadful writing, and an aesthetic that still owes much to traditional film. Each time the image cuts to a new angle, viewers have to joltingly reorient themselves in space. Still, a chase scene in Episode 5 shows some initiative in visualizing a 360° dramatic landscape. Similarly, a short clip, Mr. Robot VR, available on a number of headsets, does little other than put the characters on a Coney Island Ferris wheel and allow the show’s creator, Sam Esmail, to mess around with the new technology. Liman’s Swingers star Jon Favreau—now a major Hollywood director himself (Elf, The Jungle Book)—has a more promising interactive project called Gnomes & Goblins in the works; a preview is currently available exclusively on the Vive. Remembering Pearl Harbor, produced by Time Life and available on the Vive, lets you access archival historical recordings and material by wandering around and picking things up; it’s well done, but it plays like a CD-ROM the company never got around to releasing in the 1990s. Jaunt also has some sort of deal with Paul McCartney that has resulted in VR concert documentaries (good) and Paul ­McCartney: Early Days, which simply puts Macca in a room and projects slide photos over his face while he talks about the young Beatles (not so good). Some VR content houses have thought harder about the medium’s possibilities. Penrose Studios has created two animated shorts for most VR platforms: The Rose and I and the excellent Allumette combine crude stop-motion-style graphics with engaging stories and a genuinely novel vantage point in which the viewer seems to hover in space; the Vive’s motion tracking especially allows you to lean in, peer around, and get up close to the characters. For the more adventurous, there’s a wealth of what might be called cottage-industry VR on the Internet, made by unaffiliated creators curious to push the boundaries of a new medium. Most of it involves 360° filmmaking, but only some of it is in 3-D, and very little involves motion tracking. The high point of cottage-industry VR so far may be last year’s Career Opportunities in Organized Crime, which billed itself as the first 360° feature-length VR movie. Directed by virtual-reality enthusiast (and radiologist) Alex ­Oshmyansky, Career Opportunities is about as crude as they come—it looks like something made in borrowed offices and someone’s garage, and in fact it was. But there’s a story of sorts there, about a Russian mobster with a human resources department and a slacker kid who locates his inner badass. Unfortunately, that’s where the innovation stops. Almost all the dialogue-heavy scenes play out within a typical film screen, with little exploration of the medium’s panoramic possibilities. One appeal of VR drama is its potential for surprise—for things to happen where you least expect them to. Oshmyansky’s film demonstrates a few things: first, that VR narrative entertainment may live closer to the aesthetics of theater than film (reverse theater-in-the-round, to be exact, with the viewer standing at the center of a 360° radius of action); and second, that a workable language of shots or other means of conveying information and directing audience attention has yet to be discovered. For now, what’s still being sold in most cases is novelty—the fact that you’re watching something supposedly more realistic than anything before—and not the experience itself. But realism shouldn’t be the goal; a compelling immersive environment, whether it’s reality- or fantasy-based, should be. What’s clear is that we’re just at the beginning of VR’s long gestational period, but the medium is established. The financial backing is there, as is the creative and technological drive to improve the experience. Eventually there will be a project (or two, or three) that will transform virtual reality from a curiosity to a genuine mass-appeal canvas for expression and entertainment. Works like Allumette, Notes on Blindness, and especially Dear Angelica point the way toward what VR might yet become, but it’s almost impossible to describe what that may be. A movie that we seem to live? An adventure that doubles as a world? An immersive head trip, a tour of this and other planets, just another way to numb ourselves with fantasy? We lack words to describe the future because we haven’t invented it yet. Ty Burr is a film critic for the Boston Globe. Learn more about virtual reality at EmTech Digital 2017.

Founder and CEO of Magic Leap Rony Abovitz has defended his company on Twitter. Image: Getty Images for Wired By Ariel Bogle2017-02-12 02:25:59 UTC Shortly after a photo of company hardware was leaked, the CEO of the augmented and mixed reality company Magic Leap has gone online to correct the record. On Saturday, Business Insider published an image of what it said was "a working prototype" of the Google-backed startup's portable augmented reality device given to it by a source. On Twitter, Rony Abovitz claimed Saturday the photo showed only a "R&D test rig." SEE ALSO: How virtual reality is changing storytelling The image depicts a man with a kit on his back that looks as if it's in the early stages of development, but Abovitz's tweet suggested it was not intended as consumer technology. "The photo you are all excited about is NOT what you think it is," he wrote. "The photo shows an @magicleap R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work. "We do this in order to understand lighting, texture, various surfaces." Hi everyone - the photo you are all excited about is NOT what you think it is. — Rony Abovitz (@rabovitz) February 12, 2017 The photo shows an @magicleap R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work. — Rony Abovitz (@rabovitz) February 12, 2017 We do this in order to understanding lighting, texture, various surfaces. MxRL lives in the real world. — Rony Abovitz (@rabovitz) February 12, 2017 We do this in order to understand lighting, texture, various surfaces. sorry - previous tweet had bad spelling :-) — Rony Abovitz (@rabovitz) February 12, 2017 As Mashable noted earlier, the leaked photo has done little to assuage fears the company's technology has been overhyped. With investors including Alibaba and Legendary Entertainment, the secretive company is rumoured to be working on a head mounted display that superimposes 3D animation on the real world. A December report in The Information raised questions about whether Magic Leap was ready for primetime amid concerns that much of its work could not be commercialised or miniaturised. Two former employees also reportedly told the outlet a promotional video showing the technology in action was in fact created by the special effects company, Weta Workshop. Abovitz concluded his Twitter statement by reassuring fans: "We will not let you down."  No word yet on when the world can see exactly what Magic Leap has been building. To all the @magicleap fans: we will not let you down. Back to heads down mode so we can finish and ship :-) — Rony Abovitz (@rabovitz) February 12, 2017 Magic Leap has been approached for comment about the leaked photo.

(Photo: Nancy Kaffer) 511 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 37 COMMENTEMAILMORE They showed up for the revolution. They got Robert’s Rules of Order. And that’s just one of the challenges apparent after this weekend’s Michigan Democratic Party convention, for a party establishment working to bring into its fold the vocal, enthusiastic and uncompromising progressive wing, thanks to whom convention crowds swelled to record sizes. Among party leaders, there seem to be few concrete plans to engage with newly activated progressives, the ones who are joining groups like Forward Action Michigan, Michigan For Revolution or local organizations based around the Indivisible Guide, a roadmap for resistance based on Tea Party tactics – or even recognition that barriers to participation in the party can seem unreasonably high to folks on the outside. And among some progressives, there is, at times, an almost arrogant disdain for the work of so-called establishment Democrats who’ve been in the trenches for years (and whose priorities and goals are and have long been progressive) and, at times, a disregard for the rules of engagement. Here’s the kind of thing I’m talking about: During the election of party chair, state Rep. Adam Zemke, D-Ann Arbor, the convention’s chair, called for additional nominations from the floor. But when a member of the crowd shouted that he’d like to make a nomination, Zemke shut it down – the hopeful nominee hadn’t obtained the requisite number of signatures, and didn’t qualify. Incumbent chair Brandon Dillon easily won re-election.

And participants are obligated to learn what’s required to make a motion, or nominate a candidate, or run for a leadership position. But the party’s structure is often opaque; that process can be difficult to navigate, and the outcome here was not a good look for anyone. At worst, it’s the kind of thing that lends credibility to the claim that the system is stacked against outsiders – and the kind of thing that makes party insiders view newcomers as unruly threats to party stability. At best, it’s horribly inefficient, a missed opportunity to add new talent to the party’s ranks. That’s got to change. Convention-goers I talked to spoke of the difficulty of finding and connecting with local Democratic clubs or caucuses. Google enough, and you’ll turn up a page on the state party’s website listing local Democratic clubs, but there’s no link on the party’s homepage. A flow chart on that site attempting to explain the party structure is a joke – you’d have to already understand how the party worked to make sense of it. “Inclusion” is the word I heard again and again, from folks like Ted Wilson, a 36-year-old Lansing resident who walked the convention floor with a “Michigan for Revolution” flag, accompanied by a guy in a Birdie Sanders suit -- – a character based around an Disney-princess-like moment when a bird alighted on a podium during a Sanders stump speech. Revolution, Wilson says, means getting involved. Standing up for what he believes in. As for the establishment, they need to start listening to voices that haven’t been heard – even if that means changing the rules. The party doesn’t need to change its positions, said Donald O’Neill, a 43-year-old market researcher from Oak Park. “It needs to change tactics.” A good place to start? Stop running away from liberal positions. And listen. That’s one thing Dillon is hoping for. Dillon says the progressive, enthusiastic turnout is nothing but positive – and that the party welcomes all. “People are showing up because they want to get involved. If you want to change the direction of the Democratic Party, you’ve got to show up,” he said. Dillon sees a more active role for the party: less fundraising, more organizing. And, he says, the party should help folks who want run for office, work at the district level, organize protests to resist the actions of Republican lawmakers in Washington D.C. or Lansing. “We have to make sure the doors are open for anyone who wants to oppose the extreme (Republican) agenda,” he said. “I believe elections in 2018 will be won by the work we do in 2017.” Former state lawmaker Rashida Tlaib, the first Muslim-American woman elected to the Legislature, was more blunt: The party has to stop viewing itself as a thing apart from the people it aims to represent. And lawmakers have to go beyond policy. Tlaib says she remembers a time when Democratic elected officials were organizers – out marching with constituents, or even leading the marches. Now, she says, it’s “push the button and vote. Send out a press release. That’s not good enough anymore.” When I asked U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint – who most political insiders believe is preparing a run for governor – about the value of an influx of new party members who may not value the party, he told me I’m asking the wrong question. “It all starts with the question, what is the party? The party is what we make it. Everyone who wants to have a meaningful role, no one is shut out for that,” Kildee said. “I don’t think the party has been focused enough in engaging people on the issues” – public schools, income inequality, support for women’s reproductive rights. “Those are the things people think and talk about all the time,” and that’s what the party has to offer its members, Kildee said. “If they show up at progressive meetings and all we talk about is who is going to be the third alternate delegate to the resolutions committee, they’re not coming back.” Lost in this mix, all too often, is that by and large, those establishment Democrats, the one who've been running the party, want the same things as those newly energized progressives, even if they've been willing to compromise to make tentative steps forward when great leaps aren't possible. “You have to recognize that if you want to forward an agenda, when you’re not in the majority, you have to be strategic. Being strategic is not all or nothing,” said Kim Trent, a member of the Wayne State Board of Governors. “There are things I am willing to put on the back burner, or sacrifice entirely, for key elements of a platform or agenda. Who I look to for inspiration is (late, legendary Detroit Mayor) Coleman Young.  He never sacrificed his core values, but he knew how to reach across the aisle, and he got a lot of stuff done.” But that's a hard sell to some. “There is no one in this room who is the enemy,” U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, said in a call for unity to the progressive caucus – but just moments before, some members of the caucus tried to bar her from speaking. Newly elected progressive caucus chair Kelly Collison told the standing-room-only crowd of her admiration for a legislative candidate who was like Michigan’s version of Sanders, but even more hardcore – this candidate, Collison said to wild applause, didn’t even accept campaign contributions from the party. “Unfortunately,” Collison finished, apparently without irony, “She lost.” Collison wasn't the only progressive to win a leadership role in the party. Let's hope their elevation leads to a different outcome. 511 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 37 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2kD2FPb

Hump Day Deals: Cheap PC Software, 30% Off Lego, Free Google Play Music Why NBN Co Is Wrong About Gigabit Broadband There Are Six Styles Of Love. Which One Best Describes You? I'm Ven Lai, Creative Designer At Chevrolet, And This Is How I Work Andy Orin Feb 16, 2017, 3:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  cars Design how i work interview lifehacker interviews qa Share Building something as complex as a car is an expansive collaborative effort calling on people with diverse backgrounds. There are, of course, the engineers designing the actual mechanics, but there are also the aesthetic and tactile elements that affect how you experience the car, each carefully chosen by designers. Ven Lai is one such person at Chevrolet, where she helped design the colour and trim for the Chevy Cruze. She has a background in fashion design and perhaps unexpectedly was recruited to work in the auto industry, where she puts her creative skills to use. With her unique position adding some colour to our usual fare, we spoke with Lai to learn a little about how she works. Location: Design Center in Warren, MI Current Gig: Lead Creative Designer, Global Chevrolet Colour and Trim for the Chevy Cruze One word that best describes how you work: Attentively Current mobile device: My life is my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and for work I have an iPhone 6 Current computer: Apple Mac Pro and iMac First of all, tell me a little about your background and how you got to where you are today. I have a design background in Fashion Design and Applied Textiles and was recruited by GM Design while in school. I knew nothing about automotive design or colour and materials at the time but took the job anyway. My first day at work, I sat in a car with my boss and she explained every part of the car to me and then gave me Colour and Trim responsibility for all our global small cars. I learn everything at hyper speed. One of the first vehicles I worked on was the Chevy Cruze; I remember vividly realising the scale and immense impact of such a global product. What apps, software or tools can't you live without? Why? At work, I use Adobe products extensively to visually communicate creative ideas, graphic layouts and strategies for product. Image mining is essential to my job and VSCO and Instagram are great platforms for daydreaming, inspiration and sharing. I'm obsessed with my phone and how Google knows my habits and anticipates my needs. What's your workspace setup like? My desk faces a glass wall that looks out to an open air patio, natural light is really nice to have when working with materials and colours. I have my Mac Pro, two giant screens and a Wacom tablet. Then there are the samples: Piles of fabric swatches, paint samples, chrome bits, door parts, instrument panel sections, floor mats, leather hides, spools of thread, seat buns, laser etch samples... Endless materials that I hoard. What's your best time-saving shortcut life hack? I allocate time (as close to deadline as possible) to tasks that don't have devastating consequences so I don't meander and change my mind. I like to pack right before a trip — I will start packing 15-30 minutes before I have to leave for the airport... This gives everyone else anxiety. At work, I shift my schedule to come in extra early when the workload gets intense, so I have time alone without distractions. I will also block out hours on my calendar for creative work so it's not interrupted by meetings. What's your favourite to-do list manager? Pen and paper. Besides your phone and computer, what gadget can't you live without and why? I always have a sketchbook and pen for ideas; I love going back to sketches and notes. I prefer quality fine line black ink pens, and I buy them by the dozens because they are beautiful on paper, inexpensive and travel well. What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What's your secret? I keep a cool composure under pressure and stress. I thrive on challenges, conflict and setbacks, and it's just an opportunity to figure out solutions and do things better. What do you listen to while you work? Got a favourite playlist? Maybe talk radio? Or do you prefer silence? I have terrible taste in music so I click random stations and playlists on Spotify or one my husband has compiled. What are you currently reading? What's something you'd recommend? [I'm reading] Every travel recommendation or snippet on Mongolia in anticipation of my travels there this year. [And] Paul Beatty's The Sellout. How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work? For a quick break I need fresh air and preferably crisp air, but just some time outdoors will do. Playing fetch with our puppy is also pretty good — his excitement is immediately gratifying and I don't have to run around. Spending time in the kitchen also works for me, I like taking on tedious and exhausting recipes. What's your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early-riser? I do not have the healthiest sleeping schedule. I'm usually in bed between midnight and 1AM and up by 5 or 6AM. This works for me. Fill in the blank: I'd love to see _________ answer these same questions. Massimo Bottura, Italian restaurateur and chef. What's the best advice you've ever received? Stay humble and hungry. Is there anything else you'd like to add that might be interesting to readers and fans? I find so much value in travelling to cultural cities; I prefer the sensory overload of a hectic and crowded city. The mundane humming background noises, the not quite familiar smells lingering, the materials on old buildings standing in contrast next to gleaming new architecture, the colours of local produce and artisan products at the market, the street fashion. Nothing beats witnessing a city in person. As a creative person, I'm always documenting these details; they can easily find their way into future design for Chevrolet. We've asked heroes, experts and flat-out productive people to share their shortcuts, workspaces and routines. Want to suggest someone we should feature or questions we should ask? Let us know.

Alex WebbAlex Sherman Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring start-ups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. Photo: Reuters San Francisco/New York: “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple Inc. chief executive officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.” It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its $246 billion cash pile to meet ambitious sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400 million acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc.’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1 billion, including its $22 billion WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp. has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50 billion by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50 billion target, the company must find an extra $13 billion in services revenue over the next four years—beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc. ended 2016 with sales of less than $9 billion, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co. and electric carmaker Tesla Inc., Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55 billion under management. The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry. When AT&T Inc. agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc. and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under chief business officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring start-ups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger—you may call it arrogance—about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for $9.5 billion, Microsoft had to write down $7.6 billion of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60 percent in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60 billion—20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal. “There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said.

The non-profit organization has now launched the beta version of a new search engine called CC Search, which is designed to make it even easier to find those images and attribute them to the copyright holder. Search engines like Google, Pixabay, and Flickr also offer tools for finding free-to-use images. Creative Commons acts as a hub for searching multiple resources from one place. While the original Creative Commons allows people to search for images, audio, and video, the new CC Search focuses on images only. “The new CC Search harnesses the power of open repositories, allowing users to search across a variety of open content through a single interface. The prototype of this tool focuses on photos as its first media and uses open APIs in order to index the available works.” New additions to the beta version of CC Search lets users find images within 500px, as well as cultural works from Rijksmuseum, the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the time of this writing, there are roughly 9,477,000 images to search through in total. The new version also features a more modern design, as well as the ability to search for images by title, creator, and tags. Users can create lists of their favorite images and save searches for easy access at a later time. With a new one-click copy and paste feature, publishers can easily apply the correct attribution when using images found in CC Search. As a beta version, further development will based upon feedback from its initial users. The company hints at future plans in the announcement on its blog: “Our goal is to cover the whole commons, but we wanted to develop something people could test and react to that would be useful at launch. To build our beta, we settled on a goal to represent one percent of the known Commons, or about 10 million works, and we chose a vertical slice of images only, to fully explore a purpose-built interface that represented one type but many providers.” CC Search also wants to create a more social experience by allowing users to share their curated lists as well as add tags and favorites to images found in the commons. The organization emphasizes this is a “significant moment” for Creative Commons, but by no means is it the final product. The beta version is being released as early as possible in order to create the conversations and discussions necessary to guide further improvement.

HTC executive says, "it's not a phone slapped onto a headset." Sarah Tew/CNET Mobile by Aloysius Low February 15, 2017 4:23 AM PST @longadin HTC will soon launch a new virtual reality toy you can use on the go. The device will be compatible with HTC's new flagship phone, the U Ultra. But HTC says it won't be just a simple headset like Samsung's Gear VR. VR, which puts headset wearers into a computer-generated digital world, has swept across the tech industry over the last few years. HTC bet on the high end with its Vive system, which requires a pricey, powerful PC to run. But there are more affordable options like the Gear VR and the Google Daydream View that work by plugging in your phone to a cheap headpiece. HTC's follow-up to the Vive could could bridge the gap between these two types of system. "We have a good plan in terms of combining mobility with VR," said Chia-lin Chang, HTC's president of global sales, in an interview at the HTC U series launch event in Singapore. "Vive is very top end, and in the coming months you'll see our plans in terms of mobility and VR, and it's not a phone slapped onto a headset," he said. "It'd be a different thing." Chang added that the mystery VR product would launch before the end of the year. "We're a VR company, we're going to have something," he said. 48 HTC U Ultra and Play shine on in glass HTC's shift in focus to VR comes as the company continues to stumble with its core phone business. The Taiwanese company put its marker down on virtual reality in 2016 with the launch of the Vive, which went up against the Oculus Rift system from Facebook and against Sony's Playstation VR. Chairwoman and CEO Cher Wang highlighted the VR efforts in a statement when HTC disclosed poor financial results in its fourth quarter on Tuesday. The company reported an operating loss of NT$3.6 billion (about $116 million) with revenue falling 14 percent to NT$22.2 billion (about $722 million) despite "robust sales performance." While HTC remains high on virtual reality, critics question whether the technology has lived up to the hype set last year with the debut of most of the big-name VR systems. The amount of fresh VR content that appeared at CES was underwhelming, although filmmakers are trying to find ways to draw you in. HTC is working to foster that content as well. "We have learned much from our entrance into the world of virtual reality," Wang said, "and we believe our focused approach to building the ecosystem is the right strategy to enable the whole industry to expand through the creation of compelling content and rich experiences."

According to the data, global sales of smartphones to users totaled 432 million units during the quarter, an increase of 7 percent compared to the year before. Perhaps most notably, Q4 2016 saw Apple leapfrog Samsung to become the number 1 global smartphone vendor…. In Q4 2016, Apple sold roughly 77 million iPhones, up from 71.5 million compared to the year before. That growth pushed Apple to 17.9 percent of the smartphone market, a 2 percent increase year-over-year. Samsung, on the other hand, saw shipments fall from 83.4 million to 76.7 million, thus causing its market share to slide from 20.7 percent to 17.8 percent. It has taken eight quarters for Apple to regain the No. 1 global smartphone vendor ranking, but the positions of the two leaders have never been so close, with only 256,000 units difference. “The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,” said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. With that in mind, here’s how the smartphone industry looks in terms of Q4 2016 market share: Apple – 17.9 percent Samsung – 17.8 percent Huawei – 9.5 percent Oppo – 6.2 percent BBK Communication Equipment – 5.6 percent For 2016 as a whole, smartphone sales totaled nearly 1.5 billion, up around 5 percent from the year before. In terms of vendors, however, Samsung reigned supreme. The company shipped 306.4 million smartphones, giving it 20.5 percent of the market. Apple shipped 216.06 million smartphones for 14.4 percent of the market. Samsung’s share is down 2 percent year-over-year, while its shipments were down roughly 14 million. Apple saw its share fall from 15.9 percent to 14.4 percent, while shipments were down 9 million units. Samsung and Apple both lost market share to up and coming Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Oppo, both of which saw an increase in their share year-over-year. This is a trend that has taking shape for several recent quarters. Finally, as far as operating systems are concerned, Android obviously has the lead here. Google’s operating system holds 81.7 percent of the market, down 1 percent year-over-year. iOS, however, holds 17.9 percent, which is up .2 percent compared to the year before. Read the full report below: Gartner Says Worldwide Sales of Smartphones Grew 7 Percent in the Fourth Quarter of 2016 Fierce Battle Between Apple and Samsung to Hold the No. 1 Global Smartphone Ranking Global sales of smartphones to end users totaled 432 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 7 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2015, according to Gartner, Inc. The fourth quarter of 2016 saw Apple leapfrog past Samsung to secure the No. 1 global smartphone vendor position (see Table 1). In 2016 overall, smartphone sales to end users totaled nearly 1.5 billion units, an increase of 5 percent from 2015 (see Table 2). “This is the second consecutive quarter in which Samsung has delivered falling quarterly smartphone sales,” said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. “Samsung’s smartphone sales declined 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and its share dropped by 2.9 percentage points year on year.” “Samsung’s smartphone sales started to drop in the third quarter of 2016, and the decision to discontinue the Galaxy Note 7 slowed down sales of its smartphone portfolio in the fourth quarter,” added Mr. Gupta. “The withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 left a gap in its large-screen phone range.” Samsung also faced growing competition in the midtier and entry-level smartphone segments from Huawei, Oppo, BBK and Gionee, which all grew their sales each quarter. Closest Quarter Ever Between Samsung and Apple It has taken eight quarters for Apple to regain the No. 1 global smartphone vendor ranking, but the positions of the two leaders have never been so close, with only 256,000 units difference. “The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,” said Mr. Gupta. “This time it achieved it thanks to strong sales of its flagship phones — the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; it also benefited from the weakened demand for Samsung’s smartphones in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe, and in some mature markets in Asia such as Australia and South Korea.

Huawei’s premium smartphone offering has helped it to reduce the gap with Samsung during the fourth quarter of 2016, with a difference of 36 million units. In the same period last year, the gap between the two vendors was more than 50 million units. “Huawei is poised to reduce the gap further with the No. 2 global smartphone vendor,” said Mr. Gupta. “Mate 9 with Alexa will start shipping into the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017.” Offering high-performance, front-facing cameras and fast charging smartphones led Oppo to maintain the No. 1 positon in China during the fourth quarter of 2016. Its strong position in China and continued growth of sales in the markets outside China have helped Oppo position itself as the No. 4 smartphone vendor worldwide. BBK’s focus on quality, design and strong branding initiatives has positioned it as a strong mobile phone brand in China and India. BBK continued its hold on the No. 2 position in China and was marginally ahead of Huawei during the fourth quarter of 2016. BBK’s strong performance in India, where its sales grew by 278 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, and more than 363 percent in 2016 overall, allowed it to emerge as the No. 5 smartphone vendor worldwide. Top Chinese brands such as Oppo, BBK, Huawei, ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo are aggressively expanding into markets outside China, where they will continue to disrupt the top smartphone players in 2017. “Samsung needs to successfully launch the next Galaxy flagship phone in order to continue the momentum Galaxy S7 generated, and win back lost customers by launching a new large screen and stylus-equipped smartphone,” said Mr. Gupta.

In 2016 overall, Android also grew its market share by 3.2 percentage points to reach an 84.8 percent share, and was the only OS to grow market share year on year. “The entry of Google’s Pixel phone has made the premium Android smartphone offering more competitive, while the re-entry of HMD (Nokia) in the basic (midtier) smartphone category, is set to further increase the competition in emerging markets,” said Mr. Gupta.

Humans should spend more time worrying about other humans rather than obsessing about AI powered robots turning evil, said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent company Alphabet. "One of my friends Andy McAfee says that the humans will revolt before the computers do," he said. McAfee is a scientist at MIT. Schmidt added, "there's so much else going on that we should worry about ourselves. My personal view." The comments came at the RSA Conference in San Francisco Wednesday night. Other tech luminaries, like Elon Musk, have expressed concern that AI could eventually surpass human intelligence, then turn on us and destroy us. For instance, Musk recently said that it was "critical to the future of humanity" that we use AI to augment rather than replace human abilities. But Schmidt thinks this apocalyptic scenario is more suited for science-fiction movies than real life. "That, by the way, is a movie, OK? That's a movie, it's not true. Can we start over? It's a movie. It has not occurred yet, we're still here," he said. "And, more importantly, the scenario has an enormous number of assumptions." When it comes to artificial intelligence, the most interesting advancements are being made in computer vision - now better than human vision in many instances - which has huge impacts on healthcare and transportation, he said. "Things that bedevil us like traffic accidents and bad diagnoses in the medical system are going to get much better," he said. "I will stake my reputation that that's going to be the real narrative over the next five years."

(Photo: Sean Fujiwara for USA TODAY) 16503 CONNECTTWEET 8 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE It has been my life’s mission to ensure we learn important lessons from the past so that we don’t repeat them. That’s why this week, I presented a petition of support for Muslims in the USA, signed by more than 300,000 concerned Americans who oppose President Trump’s immigration ban, to the Muslim Public Affairs Council. It’s why I will speak Sunday at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library about his Executive Order 9066 that placed Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II. Perhaps most personally, on Feb. 19, known as the Day of Remembrance, the film of my Broadway musical Allegiance will have an encore screening in theaters, in partnership with Fathom Events. It tells the story of a Japanese-American family, much like mine, during the internment. I remember that day when American soldiers came to our home, carrying rifles with shiny bayonets, and ordered our family out. I was 5 years old. We were put on a train with armed soldiers at both ends of each car, as if we were criminals, and transported to Arkansas. Google pays tribute to Japanese internment activist I remember the barbed wire fence of the internment camp, the tall sentry towers with machine guns pointed down at us. I remember the searchlight that followed me when I made the night runs from our barrack to the latrine. It became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall. To go with my father to bathe in a mass shower. I could see the barbed wire fence and the sentry tower right outside my schoolhouse window as I recited the words “with liberty and justice for all”— too young to feel the stinging irony in those words. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share George Takei on why his musical, ‘Allegiance,’ about the Japanese-American internment, is returning to theaters Feb. 19. Sean Fujiwara, USA TODAY Our president has trumpeted an “America First” policy, vowing to prioritize the well-being of the United States. But “America” doesn’t seem to include the brown-skinned, foreign-sounding or non-Christian people affected by his travel ban, his Mexico border wall or his immigration raids. When Trump labels them “bad hombres” or “terrorists,” he feeds a narrative of “us vs. them.” Keeping America safe means shutting out Middle Eastern refugees and deporting “rapists” and “murderers.” Keeping American jobs means keeping out Mexicans who cross the border to take them. So long as Trump can create a “them” who is out to get “us,” his actions are justified in the minds of many. A definitive list of celebrity stances on Trump's controversial immigration order Seventy-five years ago, on Feb. 19, 1942, President Roosevelt launched his own version of “us vs. them,” authorizing the military to designate military zones and exclude any person from those zones as it saw fit. That order, like Trump’s travel ban, was on its face neutral. But it bore a clear intent. Nearly 120,000 innocent people of Japanese ancestry were incarcerated simply because we looked like “them” — the enemy. Two-thirds of us were U.S. citizens. We lost our homes, our jobs and our businesses and were held for years without charge. The government had put “America First,” and we suffered for it. We all must work together to ensure we do not again begin down a path of racial or religious division. As Americans, we must identify such practices and call them out: It is a Muslim ban, they are targeting Mexicans, the orders do derive from bigotry and animus. We understand viscerally, as a nation, what those words “America First” truly mean. I hope you will all see Allegiance and help honor the memory and suffering of those who came before. Each of us bears a responsibility to understand that past so that we don’t repeat it.

Though the company's traction is gaining outside of China, Huawei's assistant may wind up exclusive for its phones used in China as the company focuses on using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant - the search giant take on a voice-controlled assistant - for devices it releases internationally. This isn't Huawei's first rodeo with phone-integrated assistants, however, as the company's first full-on introduction to the US - the Huawei Mate 9 - is releasing a second version later this year that comes packed-in with Amazon Alexa support. Once a standout feature, competitors to Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant could soon become a crowded market, with companies such as Adobe, Samsung, and potentially even Nokia all planning a hat of their own to throw in the digital assistant ring.  Siri vs Cortana - which digital assistant rules the desktop?

português suomeksi svenska SAFER Systems® Announces SAFER One™ SAFER One™: The Next Generation of Chemical Detection and Plume Modeling Software-as-a-Service News provided by SAFER Systems, LLC. Feb 15, 2017, 17:45 ET Share this article WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., Feb. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SAFER Systems® announced today the general availability of its new real-time, cloud-based chemical detection and emergency response platform - SAFER One™ - ushering in a new ERA for the company and its customers. "SAFER One™ is a best-in-breed Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that is tailor-made to meet the needs of the AgChem, PetroChem, upstream, downstream, and general chemical processing facilities alike, and is hosted on the industry's top rated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)1 Platform - Amazon Web Services (AWS). We've also integrated our SAFER One™ platform with Google Maps® and SAFER's patented plume and dispersion modeling software. This is great news for those dealing with hazardous materials at plants or facilities on Risk Management Programs overseen by the EPA," said Eric Fishman, President of SAFER Systems®. "Our goal with SAFER One™ was always to provide the most secure, scalable, and reliable integrated solution for our customers on a single Platform – enabling what we call a 'Smart Facility™'- and I think we've done that."   SAFER Systems' SAFER One User Interface SAFER Systems® views the new SAFER One™ platform as a next-generation integration and collaboration solution for fixed facilities, enabling real-time decision support and information sharing. For example, SAFER One™ has integration into many common chemical sensors and safety systems, such as open-path gas sensors, industrial weather stations, lightning detection, as well as PI historian, OPC server technologies. The real-time data from these systems and sensors can trigger alerts and notifications in SAFER One™, based on predefined limits or thresholds. Site safety personnel can push email notifications and eventually mobile alerts to anyone at a site, and possibly in danger, about things like a chemical incident or adverse weather conditions. "Enabling collaboration and sharing is another goal for our new platform," said Fishman, adding, "Now HazMat Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) or site safety managers can get real-time data and chemical incident information on the fly with any device with a browser and an Internet connection, so the system is no longer tethered to PCs or end-points at desks or Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs)." For example, an AreaRAE® can be deployed downrange with first responders or mutual aid response teams, which can then transmit data in real-time to SAFER One™ and render updated readings and downwind plume dispersion predictions. Plumes can be updated, pushed by email to responders, and evacuation plans revised based on changes in chemical concentrations or wind direction. Fishman concluded, "This is a very exciting time for us as we see the dedication to our vision bringing real, tangible value for our customers. At the same time, it is a bitter-sweet moment since our legacy SAFER Real-Time® product will sunset at the end of 2017. However, our customers love what they've seen from SAFER One™ and we continue to receive unanimously positive feedback - because it's a fantastic customer experience. This is just the ground floor for our new Platform." About SAFER Systems®, LLC. SAFER Systems'® goal is to continue to provide the GO TO solutions for real-time chemical monitoring and emergency response management, through innovation and integration of next-generation technologies. With SAFER Systems'® patented solutions, our customers can detect leaks earlier, identify their location, estimate the rate of chemical release and model where the release is headed, how fast it's moving and who's in danger. http://safersystem.com  Public Relations Contact: Michael Flavin mflavin@safersystem.com Office: 805.383.9711 Ext. 107 Mobile: 805.404.9515 1Gartner.com, "Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service," Worldwide.

Daily Edition Login to download YouTube Cancels PewDiePie Show After Disney Cuts Ties With Star Over Anti-Semitic Posts 6:12 PM PST 2/13/2017 by THR Staff FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Getty Images The Internet star allegedly posted a video that included two men laughing as they held a banner that read “Death to all Jews.” Disney’s Maker Studios has severed ties with YouTube star PewDiePie, aka Felix Kjellberg, after he released a series of anti-Semitic posts to his 53 million subscribers. Kjellberg, a 27-year-old Swede whose YouTube antics secured him multimillion-dollar deals with YouTube and Disney, posted a Jan. 11 video that included two men laughing as they held a banner that read “Death to all Jews." He made a total of nine other videos that made anti-Semitic comments or used Nazi imagery, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the news. Disney, which has owned Maker Studios since 2014, said it was severing ties with him.  "Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate," reads a statement from a Maker spokeswoman. "Maker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward." Following the move by Maker Studios, Google-owned YouTube is also cutting ties with the star. A spokeswoman for the streamer tells THR that it has canceled plans for a second season of reality series Scare PewDiePie, which streamed its first season on YouTube last year. It has also removed Kjellberg's PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred, its premium advertising tier.  Scare PewDiePie, produced by Maker Studios and Skybound Entertainment with Robert Kirkman serving as executive producer, premiered in February 2016 on YouTube Red, which charges $10 per month for access to premium videos and ad-free viewing. The second season, called Scare PewDiePie: Multiplayer, was to include Kjellberg's friend and fellow YouTuber Sean McLoughlin, aka Jacksepticeye. Kjellberg is YouTube's top star, with more subscribers than any other home-grown talent on the streaming service. The gamer, known for his goofy videos in which he commentates while playing video games, also was the most high-profile YouTuber in Maker's network of creators. Since Kjellberg signed with the YouTube network in 2012, Maker has helped him expand into new ventures, producing Scare PewDiePie and launching a gaming-centric digital network called Revelmode.  This isn't the first time Kjellberg has made some controversial moves on social media. Last summer he was briefly suspended from Twitter over concerns that his account had been hacked. At the time, a source told The Hollywood Reporter that that suspension had been a misunderstanding that resulted from comments he made about ISIS and his use of a graphic Twitter profile picture.  Kjellberg took to Tumblr to defend his more recent comments. "I was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online," he wrote, continuing, "I think it's important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes."  Feb. 14, 7:28 a.m. Updated to include details of YouTube's decision to cut ties with Kjellberg.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS THR Staff THRnews@thr.com @thr Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2017 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Senate crossbenchers don't doubt Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison's determination to balance the books and shore-up Australia's prized triple-A credit rating. As a fortnight of parliament wrapped up, Liberal Democrats senator David Leyonhjelm told AAP it isn't that the government lacks direction. "They know what they want to do but they are casting around to get past Nick," he says. The Nick in question is Nick Xenophon, whose team of three senators hold vital votes in the upper house. Morrison and Social Services Minister Christian Porter on Monday attempted something of a reset in the government's tactics to get the tick of approval from NXT for an omnibus welfare bill. However it backfired when the focus of the bill switched from child care subsidies - which benefits from some of the savings - to disability funding. Morrison's decision to pump the remainder of the bill's savings to the national disability insurance scheme and not into cutting the deficit sent mixed signals about his budget strategy. But not only that, it unwound what had been a relatively successful week of the prime minister visiting childcare centres and talking up what is seen as a positive reform by the government. Turnbull's office was not amused. For his part, Xenophon says he understands the government's concern about the credit rating and the potential fallout from a downgrade. However he doesn't see why the coalition should rob a struggling Peter to pay a disadvantaged Paul - in terms of taking money from family payments and putting it into disability services. "If the government doesn't get certain savings then it will be looking at increasing taxes," the South Australian senator says. "But I have no hesitation in increasing taxes for companies like Facebook and Google, that seem to be doing very well in the Australian environment." Leyonhjelm, who supports greater budget consolidation and lower taxes, says he was taken aback by the treasurer's decision to spend the welfare savings on the NDIS but understood the massively expensive scheme was under-funded. He says it will take the US reducing corporate tax rates - which Donald Trump says will draw $2.5 trillion back into his country from offshore - or a downgrade of Australia's credit rating to deliver a cold shower to the Senate over the budget crisis. "It will require an external factor before there will be a breakthrough but at the moment there is denial about debt and spending. It will embarrass them into saying tough times warrant tough measures." Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen acknowledges the most important national priority for the budget is protecting the triple-A rating. Labor's message is the Australian community expects any savings to be "fair" and target the top end of town and not the most vulnerable. Cabinet minister Christopher Pyne counters that Australians also want "sensible government". "Labor ... is making it almost impossible for us to govern properly in terms of fiscal management unless we spend more money or increase taxes," he argues. Voters appear to be Labor's side, as the opposition continues to lead the government in national polls. A recent Essential poll found seven out of 10 voters believe large corporations don't pay enough tax, while low and middle income earners and small businesses needed a tax break. Even among Liberal voters, 57 per cent believe big businesses should pay more tax. Business groups warn the government not to go down Labor's proposed path of cutting back capital gains tax concessions, as it could damage confidence. "The economy is delicately poised," Property Council chief Ken Morrison warns. As the stalemate rolls on, the government has found itself having to pick apart budget proposals and take piecemeal wins where it can. But in doing so there's a greater risk of vulnerability to an external shock and all of the political fallout that would bring.

According to CNET, which spoke to Chief Financial Officer Chia-lin Chang, HTC has developed a VR product compatible with the new U Ultra smartphone. “We have a good plan in terms of combining mobility with VR,” Chang said. “Vive is very top end, and in the coming months you'll see our plans in terms of mobility and VR, and it's not a phone slapped onto a headset ... It'd be a different thing.” HTC already sells the HTC Vive headset, which is a lot like the Oculus Rift in that it needs to be tethered to a PC, though it also offers an add-on that turns the headset into a standalone device, but now it's developing something altogether different. The company specified that it won't work like the Daydream View or Samsung Gear VR, both of which use a phone for its screen, sensors, and processing power. HTC Vive 2 VR headset aka Oasis is in the works CNET itself labeled the upcoming device as a "new virtual reality toy", while Chang was a bit more vague. He did suggest, however, that it is a device that'll sit somewhere between the full-fledge Oculus Rift headset and a mobile VR headset like Daydream View. It's therefore unclear what type of device this could be -- maybe a phone will still be needed, but it'll be tethered to the headset via USB? If that's the case, it'll be more like the LG 360 VR. We'll know more in the coming months, as HTC's headset should launch by the end of 2017.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM Ford bets big on artificial intelligence Future-proofing: Ford testing an autonomous vehicle at MCity. Ford wants a virtual driver system for an autonomous vehicle scheduled to meet the public in 2021 and so has decided to enlist the skills of Pittsburgh-based Argo AI. — Ford US carmaker Ford is to invest US$1bil (RM4.44bil) over the next five years in an AI startup with the aim of fast-tracking its autonomous vehicle plans.  Ford wants a virtual driver system for an autonomous vehicle scheduled to meet the public in 2021 and so has decided to enlist the skills of Pittsburgh-based Argo AI, a startup with fewer than 200 employees but one set up by Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander who formerly led Google and Uber self-driving car project teams respectively.  "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford president and CEO Mark Fields.  The plan is to combine both companies' expertise to develop hardware and software together and is the latest example of a traditional automaker looking to a potentially disruptive tech startup and particularly to an AI company, in order to fast track autonomous driving technology.  "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all."  Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Audi are all investing heavily in artificial intelligence with the ultimate aim of educating the next generation of cars on the finer points of driving and giving them the digital capabilities to learn from mistakes or past experiences in order to make the right decision on the road.  For example, at the 2017 CES, Audi demonstrated a car that could explore and learn its surroundings in order to autonomously locate and park in an available parking bay.  Some of this machine learning will reduce reliance on some of the costlier sensing systems that could initially price many out of the self-driving car market. And if no one can afford an autonomous car, none of the wider benefits – fewer accidents, less pollution, lower congestion – will be realised.  "As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future," said Fields. — AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Stand up to cancer Facebook plans video autoplay changes, TV app Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Carpool and save with GrabShare Brazil judge rules Uber drivers are employees, deserve benefits Ford bets big on artificial intelligence Others Also Read ‘Promised nets not delivered’ Sporting couple, supportive parents French prosecutor says Fillon fake work probe will continue advertisement Latest News Carpool and save with GrabShare Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Carpool and save with GrabShare Stand up to cancer Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Real-world container migrations Video 5 Easy Data Visualizations in R The mantra that all companies need to become software companies is starting to sound familiar. PaaS clouds are the key to making this happen, by providing the means to get customer-facing applications up and running quickly, Heroku CEO Adam Gross argued this week at a developer's conference. Gross said that even companies not known for producing software need to be as good at operating customer apps as Amazon, Facebook, or Google. "How are they going to absorb all that complexity and sophistication? It's not going to be by starting at the bottom of the stack," he said. Instead, a higher level of abstraction is needed. [ Download the public cloud megaguide PDF: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Joyent compared. | Stay up on the cloud with InfoWorld's Cloud Computing Report newsletter. ] PaaS's provisions for on-ramping applications quickly can enable this to happen, Gross stressed while speaking at the DeveloperWeek conference in San Francisco on what lies ahead for PaaS. Gross' talk took place amid debate over whether PaaS has, in fact, lost the cloud battle to IaaS. During the past two or three years, the industry has reached a point of divergence between on-premise software stacks, tools, and services managed by the user, and those managed on the user's behalf in the cloud. "The result of that divergence is going to have a profound impact on the evolution and innovation that happens in developer services," said Gross. He predicted that developers will be consuming developer services and that there won't be developer software anymore. Cloud usage is also affected by security and compliance controls. Applications could be deployed, equipped with security infrastructure from the cloud, and PaaS clouds also can offer data services from open source projects ranging from MongoDB to Hadoop, Kafka to Spark and Cassandra, he said. Containerization, which provides the latest level of abstraction in software, and microservices, are major trends as well. With microservices, developers working on a code base that's more than three years old are probably decomposing it from a monolithic services into multiple services, Gross noted.

Home Opinion Isro creates world record with 104 satellites launch on PSLV rocket; has made innovation in low-cost space tech a habit Isro creates world record with 104 satellites launch on PSLV rocket; has made innovation in low-cost space tech a habit Isro successfully placing a record 104 satellites—101 foreign satellites and three Indian ones—in orbit in a single launch cements India’s position as a global leader in space technology. By: The Financial Express | Published: February 16, 2017 6:00 AM Space agency Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launching a record 104 satellites, including Indias earth observation satellite on-board PSLV-C37/Cartosat2 Series from the spaceport of Sriharikota on Wednesday. (PTI Photo) Isro successfully placing a record 104 satellites—101 foreign satellites and three Indian ones—in orbit in a single launch cements India’s position as a global leader in space technology. But, more important, it also underlines the fact that the space agency has made innovation in low-cost space technology somewhat of a habit, and that could pay rich dividends in the coming years. In the present instance, there were 103 small satellites—apart from the main satellite, India’s Cartosat-2, that formed the bulk of the launcher’s payload—88 of which were from Planet Labs, an Amercian company that acquired Google’s satellite imaging subsidiary recently; the company was using Isro’s PSLV for the second-time. In all, 96 of the 101 foreign satellites were from the US—the largest spender on space technology—while the rest were from Israel, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), The Netherlands and Switzerland. While UAE, whose own space agency was created only in 2014, plans to set up a human colony on Mars by 2117, Israel is a major spender on defence and agriculture, both of which require cutting-edge satellites in orbit to transmit critical intelligence. All this should throw into sharp relief the opportunity Isro—or rather, its commercial arm, Antrix—has in building up a reputation as a low-cost, high-efficiency launcher of small satellites (weighing less than 500 kg). According to a projection by Space Works Enterprise Inc, a research firm, roughly 5,000 “micro” (10-100 kg) and “nano” satellites (1-10 kg) need to be hurled into space in 2020—compared with just 92 launched in 2013. Over 60% of these satellites will be from the commercial sector—viz. companies with play in communication, weather-tracking, remote-sensing, providing high-speed internet in remote areas, etc. Softbank-funded OneWeb alone is looking to launch 648 small satellites, as per a Business Standard article. While Wednesday’s launch shows off Isro’s deftness at a two-stage payload release—with the bulk being released in the second stage and individual orbits being in close proximity, this isn’t easy—private sector competitors that include Space X, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, etc, are yet to demonstrate a fraction of the Indian space agency’s competence. Thus, Isro securing its credential with a launch record should make it a preferred service-provider. While Isro’s commercial future may lie in establishing itself as a low-cost space solutions provider, this is not to say that the space agency should chiefly direct its attention to that. To be sure, the space agency is a research body, and it should not just bolster India’s development of commercial-use space technology, but also work on the country’s space exploration goals. Some would argue while we are celebrating our low-cost successes, the American and European space agencies are sinking as much as $18 billion and $6 billion, respectively—compared to the less-than-$2-billion the government has allocated for Isro for the coming year—in deeper research and exploration of space, while “outsourcing” launch functions to say, an Isro. But, as the success of the Mars Orbiter Mission and the planned exploration of Venus and Mars make it clear, there may be no trade-off since Isro is doing a stellar job on both fronts.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny was on hand for the official announcement, calling the company’s expansion in Ireland “staggering growth” since it first opened in Dublin in 2012. Indeed aggregates job listings in a Google search-style from employer career sites, staffing agencies, job boards, and career pages and has sites in more than 60 countries and 28 languages. Every month more than 200m job seekers visit Indeed to find and apply for jobs, according to the company. The Austin, Texas-based company has already started recruiting for sales, client services, HR, business development, marketing, finance, strategy and operations roles to join its existing 530 employees on St Stephen’s Green, which is its headquarters for EMEA — Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Company president Chris Hyams said Indeed had “handily beat its goal” set in 2012 of rapid expansion because Irish culture of being adaptable fits with its own corporate identity. “Having our EMEA hub in Dublin is the natural choice given the large pool of high-skilled talent both locally and from the rest of Europe.” Mr Kenny said that Indeed’s expansion in Ireland was a ringing endorsement of the IDA. He claimed that despite Brexit and other challenges, investments like Imagine would continue to make Ireland one of the best places globally for foreign direct investment. IDA chief executive Martin Shanahan played down fears that the new US administration will affect US investment in Ireland. Pharma giant Eli Lilly confirmed that it has put back a decision on whether to proceed with a planned €200m expansion of its operations in Cork. Speaking to the Irish Examiner, Mr Shanahan said: “I won’t comment on individual companies but there is any amount of uncertainty in the investment world. It isn’t unheard of or unreasonable that companies take stock of where they are at as they await the articulation of policy by a new US administration. My expectation is we may see some holding off of investment. However, we had hundreds of new Irish jobs announced this week and that will continue in the coming days and weeks.” Jobs Minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor said she was “concerned but not fearful” regarding the Eli Lilly decision. “I have assigned extra funding so the IDA and Enterprise Ireland can employ more people to go out and win more business for Ireland,” she added.

Some claim that automation is likely to lead to job losses and that we should prepare for that. Others argue that the new technologies will create as many jobs as they destroy: after all, that is what has happened in the past. Those – like Donald Trump – who argue they can “bring back the jobs” presume a return, or reinvention, of an almost mythical past where manufacturing dominated the economy and the big firms were also big employers who benefited from a large, full-time workforce. The trouble is, that sort of economy is fading and the big firms now tend to be the tech giants that are not necessarily big employers (Facebook has 12,000 employees, for instance; Google employs fewer than 60,000 globally). What’s more, much of the work they do is contract-based and employees are brought in on a contingent basis to work on projects. Whatever happens, it is unlikely paying work will be offered on the same terms as in the past, where people could build a career with a single firm, or industry, across a lifetime. As an indication of this shift, look no further than the way job recruitment has changed. Artificial intelligence has arrived, but Australian businesses are not ready for it Read more Increasingly, the traditional CV and interview are being abandoned as firms use new forms of data aggregation to find employees. This new field of recruitment, dubbed workforce science, is based on the idea that the data individuals create while doing things online can be harvested and interpreted and to provide a better idea of a person’s suitability than traditional methods. Whereas in the past employers might have been impressed with the school you went to, practitioners of workforce science are encouraging them to prioritise other criteria. A New York Times article on the topic noted: “Today, every email, instant message, phone call, line of written code and mouse-click leaves a digital signal. These patterns can now be inexpensively collected and mined for insights into how people work and communicate, potentially opening doors to more efficiency and innovation within companies.” Organisations including Knack and TalentBin are providing companies with information that, they claim, better matches people to jobs. Peter Kazanjy, the chief executive of TalentBin, explained to Business Insider Magazine: “Résumés are actually curious constructs now because, for the most part, work and our work product is fundamentally digital. Sometimes you don’t even need [résumés]. The reality of what somebody is and what they do … is already resident on their hard drive or their Evernote or their box.net account or their Dropbox cloud.” The very nature of this sort of recruitment suggests that employees are being sought on the basis of particular skills or aptitudes to engage in specific projects, rather than criteria that used to apply when firms hired people for a lifetime. To grasp this aspect of the changing nature of work, look no further than LinkedIn. For many, LinkedIn is that strange website somewhere between a social media platform and an online repository of CVs, and it sort of is. Nonetheless, in June 2016 Microsoft purchased it for $26bn. Why? Age of automation: what if more work is the problem, not the solution? Read more Well, for a couple of reasons. First, it generates about $3bn annually in revenue, most of which comes from corporate subscriptions to LinkedIn’s Talent Solutions database, a tool that allows employers to find staff. Second, LinkedIn is a huge repository of information about workers and the skills they have. It is a platform where people can talk to each other about work, advertise their talents, exchange information about their fields of interest and expertise, and communicate privately. For Microsoft to be able to integrate this immense repository of saleable data and work-related communications with the enterprise software they already own – from Skype to Office Suite to, in particular, their customer relations management tools – makes a lot of sense. But here’s the key: as the analyst Ben Thompson argues, LinkedIn also allows Microsoft to refocus on individual users – employees – rather than companies. LinkedIn thus becomes the platform where individuals store their work personas in a searchable, communicable form that endures across a lifetime of work, where a person’s employer changes regularly. The rise of this sort of platform therefore suggests a lot more than the simple fact that employers are using new tools to find employees. It is showing us that the nature of work is changing. That is to say, for all this to make any sense, the assumption has to be that the work of the future is increasingly going to be not full-time employment with a couple of companies across a lifetime but a constant shifting from contract to contract. It is to assume that contingent work – part-time, short-term, self-employed – is likely to become the norm, rather than the aberration it is often portrayed as today. The evidence of this change is already accumulating in employment data. More than half the jobs created in the European Union since 2010 have been offered as short-term contracts; in Australia, since 2013, two-thirds of the new jobs have been part-time; in the US, 40% of all work is now classified as contingent. By itself, Microsoft’s $26bn gamble on the changing nature of employment might not be proof of anything: the company has made bad investments in the past. But it is an indication of where some pretty serious players think work is heading. It suggests that “bring back the jobs” is not the easy solution that some would have us believe. It suggests that throwing up barriers to trade and immigration are kneejerk responses that ignore the structural transformation we are already in the midst of. It also means that the argument about whether or not robots will take our jobs is the wrong argument. The more important point is that humans are going to be in ongoing competition with machines, whether you are an accountant competing with software like Xero or a fast-food worker competing with robotic chefs. This is going to affect the hours we work, the pay we receive and the sorts of job we do. For humans to thrive in such an environment – this new environment of which recruitment is a leading indicator – we will need to drastically rethink all aspects of our economy, from education through to social welfare through to retirement.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday February 16, 2017 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Why Bill Morrow and NBN are wrong about gigabit internet Spandas Lui 16 Feb 2017, 10:46 a.m. NBN Co's CEO says Australians wouldn't use a Gbps internet connection to its full potential, even if they could get one for free, but his thinking is flawed. Why Bill Morrow and NBN are wrong about gigabit internet The reality of internet use right now shouldn't dictate the kind of infrastructure we need for the future. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Last week, NBN Co CEO Bill Morrow took a beating for claiming Australians wouldn't use a gigabit broadband service, even if it was offered for free. He hit back at his detractors with a lengthy opinion piece, explaining his position. We took a look at some of the arguments he made, and many are flawed. It's not the first time Morrow has said that there's currently very little demand for gigabit services. Here's what he said last year at NBN Co's full year results presentation: "The thing I want to point out is that we did some research of companies overseas — Google, Comcast, AT&T and so on — to ask about their gigabit-per-second services and asked whether there was a lot of uptake. The answer was no, but they offer them as a market competitive element." He echoed this sentiment again at this year's NBN Co half-year results event, and put his foot in it when he uttered this statement: "Even if we offered it for free, we see the evidence around the world that they wouldn't use it anyway ... we know there are things on the horizon that are going to increase the need for further demand. Naturally, people got angry, hence Morrow's opinion piece response. Here is a list of his key arguments and why they fall short. Argument #1: People don't NEED a 1Gbps connection Now, you can't dismiss some of his claims, especially the one about how 83 per cent of people on the NBN are opting for broadband services based on the lower wholesale speed tiers. That's just a fact. He also pointed to meetings with global operators offering 1Gbps services that said end-users aren't really taking full advantage of them. "Even in a heavy usage household right now it's likely you'd struggle to generate the need for anything close to a 1Gbps. If you had five 4K TVs streaming 4K movies simultaneously then that's only around 100Mbps being consumed, leaving 900Mbps idle," Morrow said. "Given that the vast majority of current online video viewing is in SD or HD — requiring only 2Mbps-5Mbps — then a 1Gbps pipe would be enough to stream 200 HD streams simultaneously,  way, way beyond the requirements of a normal household." Again, he is right. But there's no denying there is definitely a future need for 1Gbps connections. As IT analyst firm Deloitte notes in a 2016 report: "A Gbit/s internet connection might appear frivolous, but a decade ago some commentators may have questioned the need for a touchscreen-based device capable of transmitting data at 150Mbit/s, with storage for tens of thousands of HD photos, video quality sufficient for broadcast, secure fingerprint reader, and billions of transistors within a 64-bit eight-core processor. Yet modern smartphones with this specifications are likely to sell in the hundreds of millions of units this year. While a Gbit/s connection for a single device or a single application may be overkill, consumers are likely to continue accumulating connected devices in the long term." Morrow had said NBN Co will look to accommodate for applications that demand higher speeds than what is currently being offered on the NBN. But the NBN in its current form has long been criticised for being challenging to upgrade in the future. NBN Co's adoption of FTTdp in some rollout areas is encouraging, but the company is still predominantly working with inferior FTTN technology. Also, even if 1Gbps is a bit of an overkill for the average consumer, a readily accessible superfast broadband connection like that would be a boon for small and medium businesses. It would enable them to launch digital services and compete at a global scale more easily. Argument #2 A 1Gbps service would cost too much Morrow said that while city states like Singapore and Hong Kong can afford to offer 1Gbps connections for as low as $49 per month, such prices are impossible in Australia since the capital cost of building the NBN is much higher. "The NBN network is costing around $49 billion to build — and we need to recoup that cost — given that our business model is split between driving revenues from access and consumption charges, we simply cannot match the kind of 1Gbps pricing on offer in markets like Singapore and Hong Kong." Morrow also noted that NBN Co already offers a wholesale 1Gbps product to internet service providers (ISPs) that can be made available to more than 1.5 million homes. So far no ISP offers 1Gbps product to the public. "This is, in our opinion, because there is still minimal consumer demand for these ultra-fast speeds, especially at the prices retailers would have to charge for them," he said. What Morrow failed to address is that the way NBN Co charges ISPs for NBN services is based on consumption through what is called a connectivity virtual circuit (CVC) charge. This makes it cost prohibitive for ISPs to offer faster broadband speeds. As for Morrow's statements about the high capital costs of building the NBN and needing to recoup the money, the fact is the company is building a network with short-term goals. It's already splashing out a lot of money on a predominantly FTTN network that is likely to become obsolete in the near future. Then more capital costs will be incurred when the network will need to be upgraded. Why not just do and it once and do it right? Because, politics. Argument #3 We can't compare ourselves with other markets "For a variety of reasons, our broadband upgrade in Australia started much later, so we cannot judge ourselves against markets like these; they are much further along on their journey and you just can't compare Australia to Singapore or Hong Kong for obvious reasons including those stated above," according to Morrow. Well, can we at least try to catch up with those markets more rapidly? We are currently moving at a snail's pace on the broadband front. Customers on NBN's FTTP footprint may enjoy up to significantly better download speeds but those on FTTN have been complaining for ages that they're getting ADSL2+ equivalent performance from their connections. Even NBN Co's own advertisements show a futuristic Minority Report-esque version of Australia, but that's unlikely to become a reality with our mediocre broadband connection speeds.

Howell gets Steven Souza Jr. to fly out to left for the third out in the inning By Gregor Chisholm / MLB.com | @gregorMLB | + 0 COMMENTS DUNEDIN, Fla. -- New Blue Jays reliever J.P. Howell sounds like a man who is grateful that he will be suiting up for the home team at Rogers Centre instead of the opposing side. Howell is quite familiar with Toronto's home crowd after having spent six seasons with the Rays from 2006-12. By the sounds of it, Howell's experience north of the border wasn't always pleasant, but he seemed to enjoy it anyway. "I've always loved it there," Howell said when asked about pitching in Toronto. "I love the fans, the people, it gets rowdy. It's tough being an opponent in there. They're pretty cutthroat, they do their research. I'd love to be a home guy there. I want them to do that, keep it up, keep breaking them down." Research? What research? "They say some personal things," Howell said. "They know Google, they check it out. They definitely do. It's interesting going there. I don't want to say it's a hockey vibe, but it's a rowdy vibe." Any favorite cat calls? "They're all rated R," Howell said before breaking out in laughter. "A lot of them. Plenty of them. They get to you and it makes it a little wavy out there. It makes you a little emotional and that's what we want. We want those guys to feel it." Howell is expected to be on the mound for the Blue Jays a lot. He's replacing Brett Cecil as one of the primary setup men and there's also a chance he'll be the only lefty reliever. Based on Howell's track record, that might be a good thing. The 33-year-old made 15 appearances on no rest in 2016, limiting the opposition to a .675 OPS. That was better than his performance on one and two days' rest, and those numbers fall in line with his career norms. Over 11 seasons, opponents have a .598 OPS when Howell is pitching on back-to-back days, which is the lowest OPS allowed in the veteran's splits. "I love that," Howell said in reference to a heavy workload. "I love pitching a lot ... If I could pitch every day, I would. The more you're in there, the more feel you get, the more you can kind of pick up on what the hitter's doing. You get a much better feel physically, mentally and also watching your opponent."

Health IT From hackathon to exit: Penn students’ app to ID objects for visually impaired is acquired By Stephanie Baum Post a comment / Feb 15, 2017 at 6:23 PM Shares4 The rollercoaster ride of being an entrepreneur certainly isn’t for everybody. But for a group of University of Pennsylvania students, a hackathon, PennApps, became an avenue for developing a company to advance technology for the visually impaired and help them reduce some of the challenges of living independently. MedCity highlighted the group that later became ThirdEye in 2014. Back then, it was a Google Glass app that would articulate what was in front of users when they said “OK Glass.”  An article from Technically Philly provided even more details of how the hackathon unfolded for the team. The app enlists Google’s Cloud Vision API to identify and then voices a brief description of a given item. It can give verbalize the text on signs as well and even interpret and describe photos. ThirdEye was inspired by the cofounder Joe Cappadona’s grandfather, who is visually impaired. Ecommerce retailer for the visually impaired, TheBlindGuide, acquired ThirdEye the company, according to TechCrunch. In a blog post originally written for Forbes, Rajat Bhageria, ThirdEye cofounder and CEO, noted that the group decided on TheBlindGuide because with the eCommerce retailer’s “deep understanding of the visually impaired (through their current eCommerce business) and their expertise in healthcare”, they would be in the best position to advance ThirdEye’s product, particularly beyond the U.S. Bhageria also explained why he and his cofounders, who are still at University of Pennsylvania, decided to find an exit for their business. “a large part of our experience with ThirdEye was figuring out how to get things that normally would have cost tens of thousands of dollars done for free by consistently asking for help and leveraging our student status. “As time went on though we started to realize that while we might have been the right team to start this product, we perhaps weren’t the right team to scale it to all the visually impaired persons around the world. While we became very successful at building products and launching them with very few resources, since we were students we had limited time and also limited experience with the regulatory healthcare space. When a few parties approached us about taking over ThirdEye, we thought hard and decided that it would be for the best. Several early and growth stage companies believe there are plenty of ways to serve the visually impaired population through digital health and smart glasses.  Aira.io envisioned a way to give blind and visually impaired users realtime assistance. By having a team of navigators stationed in call centers with a screen projecting the perspective of the wearer, the idea is to enable navigators to direct wearers to their destination. Lechal takes a totally different approach. Instead of smart glasses, the company uses a combination of GPS technology and haptic feedback that transmits a vibration through the insole or the shoe to direct wearers. Lechal is part of a larger business, Ducere Technologies, founded in 2011 by University of Michigan grad Krispian Lawrence and MIT grad Anirudh Sharma in Secunderabad in India.   Image: Erhui1979, Getty Images  Shares4 Topics health IT, mcINVEST, Philadelphia, Rajat Bhageria, Startups, ThirdEye, Wearables Join us for MedCity INVEST May 17–18 in Chicago, the premier national healthcare investing conference.

The idea was explored during the recently-held Global Entrepreneurship Summit 2017 at IIT Kharagpur under 'Edupreneurship' (entrepreneurial venture targeting the education segment), the institute said in a statement on Thursday. "It is true that we can Google any information today, but NDL can fetch resources according to your educational need," said Partha Pratim Das of the Computer Science and Engineering department, who is leading the Ministry of Human Resource Development's NDL project. Das said that apps, services and platform scan be built not only to help students, teachers and parents but also for the school, university and college managements. "Start-ups can use NDL resources, which are free to access. Once the product is up and running, the start-ups winll have to give NDL usage-based royalty. NDL too would showcase the start-up on its website as content-sharing partners, thereby giving them mileage," Das added. --IANS sgh/sm/sac SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features ISRO creates world record!

Digital Trends Home > Cars > The golden years: Why we’ll all love… The golden years: Why we’ll all love self-driving cars when we’re older By Jeff Zurschmeide — February 12, 2017 9:00 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends At the Consumer Electronics Show this year, most of the talk from automakers was about autonomous cars. That’s not surprising, given the CES audience and the rapid development of self-driving technology. Depending on the automaker, the promises of completely self-driving cars ranged from imminent to cautious, but all agreed that completely or mostly autonomous cars would hit our roadways in the next 10 years. There are always exceptions, but most cars you see on the road are less than 20 years old. The average age of cars driven daily on the road is about 11 years. In fact, there are still more than 10 million cars on the road 25+ years old. When automakers talk about autonomous cars as a boon to the elderly, they’re talking about you, sooner or later. That means that any shift to autonomous cars is going to happen slowly. Americans are not about to junk any car before its time. Changes in the price of gasoline could accelerate a transition to electric vehicles and that could help speed up adoption of autonomous, but in the absence of a major event, it will take decades for autonomous cars to become a majority of cars on the road. What that means is that when automakers talk about autonomous cars as a boon to the elderly, they’re not only talking about today’s seniors. They’re talking about you, sooner or later. Weight of numbers We took some time out from the goodies at CES to chat with Jody Holtzman, Senior Vice President of Market Innovation at AARP. The advocacy group for Americans over age 50 is active in keeping the interests of older people at the top of mind for innovators and product developers. “The one question a CEO never wants to get from the board of directors is, why did you leave money on the table by ignoring the only humongous growth market that exists?’’ Holtzman points out. Right now, there are 110 million Americans over the age of 50. Both the raw number of seniors and the corresponding percentage of our total population are expected to rise in the coming decades. It stands to reason that providing services to older people should be on the minds of automakers. Further, the incentive to meet the needs of older people is compounded by differences in the way generations address mobility. “People over 50 are the market for automakers,” Holtzman told Digital Trends. “The average age of a Chevy Impala buyer, or a BMW 5-series, is over 50. They’ve got the money to buy the car, and culturally, younger people are less interested in owning a car. Once you start to get experience with Uber or Lyft and that kind of ondemand transportation opportunity, you start to think that maybe you don’t need to own a car, have a garage, and pay for all these things. Do the math! If you live in the city, it makes more sense.” Old dogs, new tricks We first started thinking about the generational aspects of autonomous adoption last year. We asked Sandee Perfetto, Director of Personal Auto Product Development at Verisk Insurance Solutions for her opinion at that time. There’s a lot of evidence to indicate that uptake of autonomous technology will not be a problem for older Americans. “The expectation is that younger drivers are more willing to jump into an autonomous car,” Perfetto told Digital Trends. “They don’t have a sense of ownership embedded into them to drive. The expectation is that older generations will stick with what they have always done – that they might not be as quick to jump to the latest technology, but I think that for the older generations, they’re looking at this as a way to stay on the road longer. It could potentially give you the ability to stay mobile longer without relying on other people.” Many of us have experience explaining technology to our parents or grandparents. From the TV remote to smartphones, we’ve learned to be patient while people adjust to new ideas – and in many cases we’ve learned some new things ourselves. The question is, will older drivers be willing to let go of the wheel and go autonomous? Improved safety leads to autonomous cars There’s a lot of evidence to indicate that uptake of autonomous technology will not be a problem for older Americans. Older drivers have eagerly adopted advanced safety features like adaptive cruise control, forward emergency braking, lane keep assist, blind spot monitoring and intervention, and rear park assist. “Older people are the ones buying luxury vehicles,” Holtzman said, “and as with every other luxury, whether it was air conditioning, blowers in the second row, or blind spot monitoring, it always starts at the higher-end cars. Little by little, you find it in other cars.” Virtually every automaker has committed to providing Forward Emergency braking as a standard feature of all cars sold in America by the 2022 model year. It’s reasonable to think that related features like adaptive cruise control would be become standard in the same timeframe. Not coincidentally, that schedule overlaps with the projected development of fully autonomous cars. As automatic safety devices take more and more responsibility for controlling the car, there may be a point of no return for all human drivers. “In one of my most interesting conversations at Waymo, the Google spinoff, they said their research showed that the more of these additional automated features you have, the worse the person’s driving gets,” Holtzman said. “They started thinking about the implications of that. This led them to say that the answer is complete autonomy. No steering wheel, no pedals, no anything.” Freedom and independence In the end, whether people of any age own a car or simply request a ride from a robo-taxi, the critical value is maintaining the ability to go where you want, when you want. “When you ask older people what’s the thing they least want to give up, it’s the car keys,” Holtzman explained, “because they represent freedom and independence and control.” That echoes Perfetto’s assessment. Adoption of autonomous technology will keep elders independent longer, and that’s something we’re all likely to want for ourselves. Holtzman went further, arguing that there are far more important variables than age. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution,” he insisted. “There are age segments, geographic segments, and lifestyle segments, so you’re going to have a multiplicity of trends.” In other words, what works in Manhattan may not work for people who live in small towns and rural areas, and what works for singles may not work for families, so we can expect a variety of solutions to be in play. “What’s most fascinating to me is what does the transition period look like,” Holztman asked. “For a period of time, you’re going to have everything on the streets at the same time. You’re going to continue to have traditional combustion engine cars, you’re going to have hybrids, you’re going to have electrics, robo-taxis, and robo-shuttles. You’re going to have a lot happening at one time.” Driving future development Holtzman’s job is to raise questions and make recommendations to companies who want to address that huge demographic of older people, and eventually all of us as we age. “I think the key is that the consumer has to be at the center of innovation,” he said. “Older people and those with disabilities have to be front and center in the design phase, because if you have designs that work for them, the designs will be even better for everybody else. It’s not a niche market, it’s using the insight gained by the lens of people with physical challenges to create products and services that have universal market application and demand.”
Digital Trends Home > Home > Keep your kids from spending hundreds of dollars… Keep your kids from spending hundreds of dollars and more ways of parenting with Alexa By Clayton Moore — February 12, 2017 1:00 PM Subscribe Share Greg Mombert/Digital Trends Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Amazon Echo MSRP $199.00 DT Recommended Product Learn More Of the myriad descriptions being levied on Amazon’s Alexa “smart home” system, its creators probably weren’t expecting the phrase “parenting nightmare.” Yet that description has come up again and again as parents discover the new and unexpected consequences of introducing kids with developing brains and underdeveloped vocabularies to devices that can misinterpret, miscommunicate, and even make purchases on your behalf. Perhaps the most famous case so far was that of Megan Neitzel of Dallas, Texas, who didn’t realize when she got an Echo Dot as a gift that her six-year-old daughter might ask the digital assistant about cookies and a dollhouse. Alexa did her job and indeed, Megan’s little girl did get what she wanted — which, in Alexa’s mind was four pounds of cookies and a $170 Kidcraft Dollhouse. To the family’s credit, they donated the fancy dollhouse to a local children’s hospital. They ate the cookies. More: Is there anything Alexa can’t do? Not much, now that the AI boasts more than 1,000 skills Then there was the aptly titled, NSFW YouTube video “Amazon Alexa Gone Wild,” in which a little boy asks the digital assistant to play “Digger, Digger.” Alexa’s misinterpretation leads to some inappropriate — albeit, hilarious — responses as the parents scramble to shout, “Alexa, stop!” But while viral videos and mistaken orders make for funny news bulletins, there is actually a serious risk in relying on digital assistants like Alexa to placate children. Some parenting experts are warning that overusing the device could make some children feel that Alexa is a servant to be commanded, which is behavior that could potentially be carried over to the schoolyard. Other experts also warn that technology often acts like a drug, firing up pathways in the brain lit up by instant gratification. More: What can’t she do? The best ways to use Amazon’s Alexa around the house Amazon didn’t include a ton of parental controls in its devices, but hopefully more are in development. For now, there are a few of quick fixes to keep your kids from becoming viral sensations. Disable shopping without a PIN Applying a pin number for the authorization of purchases is a good first step. Open the Alexa app, tap the left navigation panel, and then select Settings then Voice Purchasing. You can either turn it off entirely or require a four-digit code. Just don’t use it in front of your little brainiacs. Change your wake word so it’s not ‘Alexa’ Read: Amazon Echo Review Changing the wake word from “Alexa” to something else is another tactic. This also helps prevent the risk of secondary commands, which was an issue on Super Bowl Sunday when Google’s commercial for the Home started activating Home devices around the globe. To make the switch, open the Alexa app and select Settings from the navigation panel. Choose your device, scroll to select Wake Word, pick your preference from the drop-down menu, and click or tap Save. Amazon, Echo, and Computer are all options, though your kids might catch on pretty quickly to this switcheroo. Make your kids an account If you set up a Household Account, it allows you to make two grown-up accounts, as well as up to four child accounts. These kid accounts can’t make purchases, but you can share G-rated books and music with them. In the app, go to Settings, then Profiles & Family Library. Here, you can make a profile for your kid, though Amazon does want to know their name, gender, and birthday. To switch profiles, say, “Alexa, switch to Jr.’s profile.” This might not keep Alexa from swearing like a sailor at your minor, but it’s a start. Maybe Amazon will fix this… Maybe frustrated parents can lobby Amazon to take the advice of writer Hunter Walk, who suggested that Alexa needs a kid-only mode that only responds to “Alexa, please…”

Other retailers such as Lotte Mart and Homeplus were also found guilty of selling the deadly product. 3/19 Rogue trader A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000).

Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet face suspended sentences of 12 months and 9 months and were ordered to pay fines of €1,500 (£1,230) and €1,000 (£822) for their role in the so-called LuxLeaks scandal. Despite the minimal sentences, the ruling was described by Deltour’s lawyer as “shocking” and “a terrible anomaly.” The ruling “puts on guard future whistle-blowers,” Deltour told reporters.The LuxLeaks revelations sped beyond Luxembourg, causing European Union regulators to expand a tax-subsidy probe and propose new laws to fight corporate tax dodging, while EU lawmakers created a special committee to probe fiscal deals across the 28-nation bloc. reuters 8/19 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

AP 12/19 Panama Papers: Millions of leaked documents expose how world’s rich and powerful hid money - April 2016 Millions of confidential documents have been leaked from one of the world’s most secretive law firms, exposing how the rich and powerful have hidden their money. Dictators and other heads of state have been accused of laundering money, avoiding sanctions and evading tax, according to the unprecedented cache of papers that show the inner workings of the law firm Mossack Fonseca, which is based in Panama. 13/19 Google's tax avoidance Google reached a deal with the HM Revenue and Customs to pay back £130 million in so-called “back-taxes” that have been due since 2005. George Osborne championed the deal as a “major success”. But European MEPs have since called for the Chancellor to appear in front of the committee on tax rulings to explain the tax deal. 14/19 Turing Pharmaceuticals and Martin Shkreli Martin Shkreli became known as the “most hated man in the world” after his drug company, Turing, increased the price of a 62-year-old drug that treated HIV patients by 5,000% to $750 a pill. He was charged with illegally taking stock from Retrophin, a biotechnology firm he started in 2011, and using it pay off debts from unrelated business dealings.

Around 11 million cars worldwide were affected. 16/19 Quindell, the scandal-ridden insurance firm Quindell was once a darling of AIM but its share price fell in April 2014 when its accounting practices were attacked in a stinging research note by US short seller Gotham City. In August the group was forced to disclose that the £107 million pre-tax profit it had reported for 2013 was incorrect, and it had in fact suffered a £64million loss. 17/19 Toshiba Accounting Scandal The boss of Toshiba, the Japanese technology giant, resigned in disgrace in the wake of one of the country’s biggest ever accounting scandals. His exit came two months after the company revealed that it was investigating accounting irregularities. An independent investigatory panel said that Toshiba’s management had inflated its reported profits by up to 152 billion yen (£780m) between 2008 and 2014. 18/19 FIFA Corruption Scandal Fifa, football's world governing body, has been engulfed by claims of widespread corruption since the summer of 2015, when the US Department of Justice indicted several top executives. It has now claimed the careers of two of the most powerful men in football, Fifa President Sepp Blatter and Uefa President Michel Platini, after they were banned for eight years from all football-related activities by Fifa's ethics committee. A Swiss criminal investigation into the pair is ongoing.

He returned to the UK in December 2012 and was arrested following a two-and-a-half year criminal investigation by the SFO. Getty Images Not long after the deal was clinched, however, allegations began circulating that politicians and others involved in the deal were receiving kickbacks, AFP writes, adding that a probe was set up in 2007 to look into possible bribes, but came to no concrete conclusion. Five years later, Austrian and German authorities launched a fresh corruption inquiry. Prosecutors in Munich are set to finish their preliminary proceedings later this year, according to AFP.

Image: nattul/Shutterstock Lenovo’s Q3 financials make for grim reading as the Chinese tech giant is shedding profit at an alarming rate. Lenovo, the market leader in PC manufacturing, is in trouble. Profits of $98m for Q3 are down 67pc on the same period last year, with everything from supply chain issues and global economics blamed on the worrying trend. More likely, though, is consumer sentiment – it’s all about mobile now. Mobile home There’s a pretty good chance that, unless you’re at your work computer right now, you’re reading this on a mobile device. Many could argue that this trend led to Lenovo profits dropping from $300m in Q3 2015, to $98m in the same period in 2016. Analysts were expecting in excess of $150m. Gartner and IDC’s most recent data on PC shipments highlight the constraints that operators are working within, with eight consecutive quarters of decline. In the latest figures, Lenovo surprisingly saw its core PC business return a 2pc rise in revenues, the first upswing in seven quarters. Shipments also rose 2pc to 15.7m units. But there is strife in the PC market. Lenovo knows this, which is why it spent nearly $3bn buying Motorola Mobility from Google in 2014 – though the latter retained a significant patent portfolio. Last month, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing revealed that turning Motorola around was a harder task than they initially thought. “We underestimated the differences of culture and business model,” said Yang to the The Wall Street Journal. The low-end smartphone market in China was saturated, the high-end was dominated by the likes of Apple, so Motorola had nowhere to go. For the latest results, shipments in its mobile phone unit fell 26pc. Lenovo.

X MagGrow and MooCall selected for Alltech’s agri-tech accelerator Company teams up with Dogpatch Labs to hold 15-week mentorship programme about 3 hours ago Charlie Taylor Founder of US-based animal health company Alltech, Dr Pearse Lyons, runs the accelerator with Dogpatch Labs. Photograph: Finbarr O’Rourke Dublin-based start-up MooCall who developed a wearable device which alerts farmers when a cow is going to give birth is one of the companies chosen for the accelerator. Previous Image Next Image         Two Irish firms are among 10 start-ups that have been selected from more than 180 applicants for an agritech accelerator to be run by Alltech and Dogpatch Labs. The successful applicants, who hail from Ireland, Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Indonesia, the US and UK, will take part in a 15-week mentorship programme for agri-business innovators that are ready for market. The brainchild of Alltech founder and president Dr Pearse Lyons, who established the US-based animal health company in 1980, the programme will see applicants working with the firm and Dogpatch Labs to accelerate their business development. A total of 183 start-ups from 38 countries across six continents applied for the accelerator with applicants working in a wide range of areas, including automated irrigation, virtual reality, drones, blockchain and wearables. The programme was open to start-ups that have already raised funding, are ready to go to market and are looking for assistance in areas such as which segments to focus on. Participants will receive access to Dr Lyons and other senior executives of Alltech, which has a presence in 129 countries. They will also receive free space for three months in Dogpatch Labs in Dublin’s Docklands, a €15,000 cash fund and mentoring in a number of areas including strategy and international expansion. Start-ups will also be able to avail of software perks worth more than €300,000 from companies such as Google and Facebook. The Pearse Lyons Global Agritech Accelerator will culminate with the companies pitching on stage at the Alltech Ideas conference in Lexington, Kentucky in May where more than 3,000 attendees from 80 countries will converge. Selected firms Among the firms selected for the programme are MagCrow, a Dublin-based spinout from UCD which has pioneered a magnetic spraying system that reduces spray drift by more than 80 per cent. MooCall, another Dublin-based start-up that has developed a wearable device which alerts farmers when a cow is going to give birth, has also been chosen for the accelerator. ADVERTISEMENT “I envisaged maybe 100 companies applying but we ended up with nearly 200 start-ups, which was fantastic. The fact we are holding the accelerator in Ireland with the Dogpatch crew was very attractive to companies, who see Dublin as a tech hub,” Aidan Connolly, chief information officer at Alltech told The Irish Times. “The successful applicants have all raised at least €3 million each and are all close to market. They want access to our footprint, our market knowledge and our contacts. We have a very strong network of people we can bring in who may be potential customers, distributors and even investors in these start-ups,” he said. Mr Connolly said the agricultural sector was starting to see serious disruption from new technologies as agritech investment soars, with €9.65 billion invested in start-ups working in the space since 2013. “We’re seeing a complete revolution in the way things will be done in agriculture with the way we farm set to undergo major changes,” he said.       Topics: Aidan Connolly Pearse Lyons Dogpatch Alltech Dogpatch Labs Facebook Google MagCrow Moocall Read More McCaul tells cyber security conference of Russian role in US election Review: HTC Vive and the virtual reality revolution Irish tech firms raise record €888m led by life sciences Indeed begins advertising first of 500 new positions in Ireland A wifi bowl and an activity tracker for your dog Analytics firm NewsWhip raises $6.4m to fund expansion ‘No doubt’ Russians tried to undermine US election Toshiba books $6.3bn writedown, chairman to resign UK’s tech start-ups feeling stress of Brexit challenges BrowserStack to create 40 Dublin jobs over three years Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Personal Finance Just one in three of private sector workers have a pension Technology Adventure gaming for fans of Norse mythology Rugby Kieran Keane a strong contender be next Connacht coach Innovation The great innovation debate: has the revolution stalled?

Reg readers vote Tom Baker for Doctor 13. Of course DevOps GitLab invokes the startup defence to explain data loss woes 'We're learning every day'. But does 'test your backups' really need to be learned? 16 Feb 2017 at 07:28, Simon Sharwood When GitLab suffered its database deletion, outage and related failure of five backup tools, the company quickly offered The Register an interview. Which sounded like a good opportunity to learn just how a startup aiming for serious developers, and with US$25m of serious investors' cash in its keeping, could have failed to operate a proper data protection regime. So we said "yes!" to the offer, because we also wanted to know the extent of the company's response to the incident. If GitLab could botch backup so badly, what else could it have found? We already knew it suffered a security panic in late 2016. What of governance? Financial control? And who knows what else? But then GitLab then couldn't find time for the interview for a day … or two. And stopped answering emails. All while winning praise for its open response to the outage. Once The Reg started chatting about the situation on Twitter, in response to data protection veteran Preston de Guise's scathing assessment of GitLab's actions, we suddenly received apologies about the slow response – tough and busy week, sorry – and an offer to chat. Which we did, yesterday, with marketing veep Tim Anglade. We asked for someone beyond marketing as an alternative, and were told someone closer to the business' operations would join the call if available. They weren't. Anglade articulated what I'd like to call “the startup defence”, which holds that upstarts are allowed to make mistakes while they learn about what it will take to scale. The defence also permits startups to take their eye off the ball a bit as they pour scarce resources into urgent priorities. “Life in a startup is always about something you don't know knocking you out of the way,” Anglade told us. But he also told us GitLab did know about data protection and how to do it right. “It is not like we knew about these things and didn't do them,” he said. “We were not willfully looking the other way.” But we can plainly see that the company was not looking at indicators that would have told it that its data protection regime was failing. At least now the company realises that startups have to grow up. “We have to think of GitLab not as this thing that grew out of our garage but a critical place for peoples' projects and businesses,” he said. “We want to do a full job of meeting the needs that people expect.” The main theme to which Anglade kept returning was that GitLab has been very open about the incident and, indeed, that openness is at the core of the company's success. It published a warts-and-all Google Doc outlining the full extent of its upfuckery and a live-streamed video of its developers working to set things to rights. It's also published a full and frank account of the outage and a to-do list explaining its plans to harden its infrastructure and build proper disaster recovery tools to be overseen by “a data durability owner that will be responsible for making sure that things work.” Anglade added that his biz is “reviewing the platform across all possible vectors from security, reliability, data integrity, existing people and external resources.” Just how systematic that effort will be was hard to divine. Anglade said: “We are definitely reaching out to a lot of people now and people are offering help to assess our platform.” Those voices are coming from inside and outside the company. He added that “the CEO is taking a personal interest in the review.” A “personal interest”? To your humble hack's mind the chief exec should be all over this, unsentimentally exercising authority on behalf of investors and customers alike to ensure the business survives and then thrives. If that's happening, Anglade couldn't or wouldn't explain the process that's being used. He did say: “We are trying to make it clear we are taking this seriously. It is a big learning experience. We hope never to have to apologise again. We need to learn a little bit more every day and demonstrate we are worthy of users' trust.” The Register has no animus towards GitLab, or startups in general. It's clear that Silicon Valley's preferred way of doing business creates wealth and extraordinarily useful products. But when that way of doing business leads to organisations that move too fast to use well-known best practices, it makes us wonder if the model always works in users' interests. But perhaps those worries are irrelevant: Anglade told us GitLab's investors have not offered “anything beyond normal feedback” and “will support the effort to make the changes we need to make.” ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments More from The Register Tokens of terror spark 'major security update' at GitLab HackerOne's Jobert Abma spots import/export credential persistence problem GitLab snags VC cash, promises to 'Git-ify' the world AND build more features, of course 10 Comments GitLab.com luckily found lost data on a staging server And restored itself.

But computer vision algorithms are compute- and power-intensive, and need to process large amounts of data. These barriers have limited their use to enterprise, line-powered devices and cloud-assisted mobile devices. The implementation of computer vision algorithms on mobile processors, where compute resources are limited and power consumption must be curtailed, is key to wider use. One important computer vision technology, 3D sensing, will spread to 80 percent of smartphones by 2018, earning a total of $2 billion by 2020, according to market researchers. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro smartphone, which hit the market in late 2016, is the world's first smartphone to include Tango, a 3D sensing technology from Google, enabling a variety of games, utilities, and retail applications. Behind this launch was an intensive effort by BDTI to optimize the complex and demanding Tango algorithms to run efficiently and in real time on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor that powers the Lenovo phone.

PHOTO: postscapes Gartner gave its analysis of advanced analytics platforms a new name, but retained four of the same vendors as industry leaders for the second consecutive year. RapidMiner, KNIME, SAS and IBM lead Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Data Science Platforms. The report, formerly called the Magic Quadrant for Advanced Analytics Platforms, was published yesterday. Gartner analysts Alexander Linden, Peter Krensky, Jim Hare, Carlie J. Idoine, Svetlana Sicular and Shubhangi Vashisth, who co-authored the report, define data science platforms as: "A cohesive software application that offers a mixture of basic building blocks essential for creating all kinds of data science solutions, and for incorporating those solutions into business processes, surrounding infrastructure and products." The new name reflects changes in the data analytics market has changed since the previous analysis last March.  Organizations want data science platforms that embrace open-source technologies and machine-learning science as they move from descriptive and diagnostic analytics to predictive and prescriptive approaches. “The data and analytical needs of organizations continue to evolve rapidly,” they wrote. “Many organizations are extending the breadth of their analytical capability to include data science.” Accenture Out, Dataiku In The new definitions and analytics approaches led to some changes in this year's report. Although four vendors from last year retained their spots on the leaderboard, Quest — which Dell sold to Francisco Partners and Elliott Management Corp. in October — slipped from a leader to a challenger. Gartner dropped Accenture, Lavastorm, Megaputer, Predixion Software and Prognoz from the report. It added Dataiku, Domino Data Labs, H20.ai, MathWorks and Teradata. Gartner classifies vendors in four categories: Leaders (strong presence, significant mindshare): RapidMiner, KNIME, SAS, IBM Challengers (established presence, credibility): MathWorks, Quest, Alteryx, Angoss Niche Players (industry- and technology-specific strength): SAP, FICO, Teradata Visionaries (typically smaller players, trend-setters): Microsoft (we said "typically"), H20.ai, Dataiku, Domino Data Lab, Alpine Data  Analysts factor in a vendor's “ability to execute” and “completeness of vision.” Gartner has many requirements to get through these Magic Quadrant doors. It includes vendors that have generated revenue from data science platform software licenses and technical support that includes one of the following benchmarks: At least 150 percent revenue growth from 2014 to 2015 At least 200 paying end-user organizations Magic Quadrant for Data Science PlatformsPHOTO: Gartner (reprinted with permission) About the 4 Leaders Here’s a snapshot of the strengths and weaknesses of the four leaders, according to Gartner: RapidMiner: Algorithm, Community Strengths Cambridge, Mass.-based RapidMiner features a graphical user interface-based data science platform whose strengths include platform breadth, ease of use for all data scientists and skill levels and its “large and vibrant” user community. Gartner authors cited its its large selection of algorithms, flexible modeling capabilities, data source integration and consequent data preparation but cautioned against its data usage cap and its weak global presence (one office in the US office, three in Europe), which “could limit worldwide growth.” SAS: Strong Data Access, Model Development Cary, N.C.-based SAS offers SAS Enterprise Miner and Visual Analytics Suite, the most cited toolset by Gartner clients. It has strong data access and preparation capabilities, and “excellent” data visualization and exploration capabilities. But Gartner cautioned the platforms can be tough to learn and sometimes lead to confusion about what to use and when. KNIME: Flexibility, Reliable Sales Zurich-based KNIME has an analytics platform that includes an open-source solution that is flexible, and the platform’s low total cost of ownership is intriguing to clients. KNIME also has strong data access and transformation, sales and vendor relationships and active communities. It has challenges in model management, scalability, exploring and visualizing data, according to Gartner researchers. IBM: Committed to Open-Source Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM's SPSS Modeler and SPSS Statistics have a strong customer base, commitment to open-source technologies, support for a broad range of data types and model management and governance make it a leader, according to Gartner. SPSS supports all leading Hadoop distributions, NoSQL DBMSs and other databases. But IBM’s breadth of analytics offering sometimes leads to confusion and some also see the platforms as “outdated and overpriced,” according to Gartner.  ‘State of Flux’ for Data Science Gartner found a data science platforms in “a state of flux” and warned leaders are not immune to potential disruption because of advancements in machine learning, artificial intelligence, cloud and automation. New entrants can also be threats and Amazon, Baidu and Google are all ready to execute. Amazon and Google made Gartner’s “honorable mention” list in this Quadrant. Open-source technologies like Apache Spark, a “foundation for most data-science advances,” may also contribute to market disruption, Gartner reported. Python, R and Scala also are prevalent open-source tech in the market. Data science platforms generated almost double that of the overall BI and analytics software market in 2015, with a 20.8 percent rise bringing its total to $2.4 billion in constant currency, according to the 2016 Gartner report, "Market Snapshot: BI and Analytics Software, Worldwide, 2016” (subscription required).   Gartner estimates predictive and prescriptive analytics will attract 40 percent of enterprises' new investment in BI and analytics technologies by 2020. Organizations still must have the right personnel in place to execute on the platforms, Gartner authors reported. “Many data science platform vendors are innovative,” Gartner authors noted. “Nevertheless, organizations still face key challenges in terms of a lack of qualified staff with data science skills, long cycle times for building and deploying data science models, and difficult collaboration between business teams and data science teams.” 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Microsoft Integrates Power BI in SharePoint Online Forrester Analyst: PaaS a ‘Revolution’ for Web Content Management AI-Fueled Storytelling Takes Customer Experience to the Next Level Customer Loyalty Is Based on the Little Things How Machine Learning Uncovers Hidden Correlations for Marketers The Consumer Affinity War: Protecting Your Brand With Analytics 3 Tips for Communicating With Remote Analytics Specialists How to Get the Most out of Power BI Culture Clash: When the Developer Meets the Analytics Manager You Need an Eagle Eye to Keep Analytics (and Data) Secure Useful Article?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us ZTE working on Gigabit Phone, to be shown off at MWC 2017 By Rei Padla - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The ZTE Gigabit Phone has the potential to become a popular attraction at the upcoming Mobile World Congress. This February, Barcelona will be filled with new smartphones and tablets. ZTE wants to be ahead of the game by coming up with a smartphone that is ready for 5G. It may be years from now before such high-speed connectivity becomes a standard but we’re all going there. 4G networks are vastly expanding not only in the United States but also and especially in other emerging markets. This new phone is said to see an increase in connectivity and download speeds plus allow 360-degree panoramic VR recording, ultra Hi-Fi music and movies, instant cloud storage, and the Google Daydream support. In the next coming months and years, ZTE will focus on advancing the cloud, 5G evolution, as well as, the development of Internet of Everything. This ZTE Gigabit Phone may not be readily available at launch but we’ll get to preview what it is all about the Gigabit phone. ZTE Gigabit Phone’s introduction as a “forward-looking”device means the future of the smartphone industry is still brighter.

Instead, his mobile payments app, Toss, was funded by venture capital firms in Silicon Valley and Seoul. Toss has become a top-five payments app in Asia by transaction volume in the two years since its launch, having processed about Won2tn ($1.7bn) in transactions and gained more than 5m customers. “We see great opportunities in the country’s financial services sector, where 90 per cent of banking transactions are done mobile or online,” says Mr Lee. “But there are not many innovative fintech services as regulations discourage new attempts.” Mr Lee’s company, Viva Republica, is one of the few successful ventures in South Korea’s nascent financial technology service sector. South Korea has one of the world’s highest broadband penetrations, fast mobile internet speeds and very high smartphone usage, but industry watchers say the advanced telecoms network has not led to high-value innovation. Fintech is not the only concern — there is growing fear that the country is falling behind in high-tech software and service development including the internet of things, online-to-offline services (promoting physical stores), artificial intelligence and big data analysis because of red tape and a risk-averse culture. A survey commissioned by Qualcomm, the US telecoms group, found many South Koreans feel the country is poor at fostering and protecting technology innovation, surprising some outsiders who see it as a tech powerhouse. The Bloomberg Innovation Index last year ranked South Korea as the world’s most innovative economy, ahead of Germany and Japan, based on indicators such as research and development capability, tech density and patent activity. Led by large technology companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics, South Korea spends more on R&D than most other advanced economies. This year it was only narrowly beaten by Israel as the top R&D spender, shelling out 4.23 per cent of GDP compared with Israel’s 4.25 per cent. However, many South Koreans worry that the country is losing its innovative edge as conglomerates such as Samsung focus on hardware, despite growth in the IT industry shifting to software and services. The government has made support for start-up companies central to its policy agenda — but so far there are few cutting-edge technology start-ups with international reach. South Korea had a popular social networking site called Cyworld, launched in 1999 — before Facebook — but its failure to expand abroad due to language and cultural barriers undermined it at home. The country’s dominant messenger app, KakaoTalk, has tried to go global but made little headway. Our conformist corporate culture does not allow out-of-the-box thinking “There are few start-ups with really innovative services, with many of them trying to introduce copycat versions of proven overseas models to Korea,” says Lee Taek-kyung, head of angel investor network Mashup Angels. Although the funding for start-ups has improved under the current administration, which is investing billions of dollars in small companies, they still struggle to grow in the shadow of the big conglomerates — or chaebol — which are dominant in most industries. “Chaebol dominance in manufacturing and distribution raises entry barriers for start-ups,” says Kang Jeong-soo, director of the Institute for the Digital Society. “The government should focus on offering a level playing field for smaller companies.” Experts say outdated regulation often blocks innovative ideas. Uber has suspended its ride-sharing service, UberX, in South Korea, bowing to regulatory pressure and protests from taxi drivers. Airbnb, the peer-to-peer holiday rentals service, is grappling with tough regulations restricting its business. Google offers a limited mapping service in South Korea due to the country’s national security laws. South Korea’s internet-only banks have yet to start operations due to regulations limiting non-financial companies’ investment in the sector. Strict regulations around testing autonomous driving technologies and flying drones have also come under fire for hindering technology development. “In Korea, it’s only legal if the law says it’s legal. In the US, it’s only illegal if the law says it’s illegal,” says Tim Chae, partner at 500 Startups, a venture capital based in Silicon Valley. “The latter optimises for innovation, the former optimises for the status quo. That’s probably the single biggest thing that needs to change.” The country’s rigid corporate culture and education system are also seen as drags on innovation. Software remains a weakness of Korean tech companies such as Samsung as their top-down culture hinders creativity. “Our conformist, military-style corporate culture does not allow out-of-the-box thinking,” says Mr Lee at Mashup Angels. South Korea boasts one of the world’s most highly educated workforces but experts say the school system’s focus on rote learning is not suitable for nurturing innovative talents. “Our schools are still run like a brick factory designed to churn out as many bricks as possible,” says Lee Kark-bum, head of Future Thinknet, a research institute. “It is hard to cultivate risk-taking, innovative talents under the current education system,” he adds.

Business U.S. Chamber of Commerce Hosts Nigerian Trade Minister as Both Agree to Work Together By Press Release - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter United States of America, February 15, 2017/ — The U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s U.S.-Africa Business Center Tuesday hosted the Nigerian Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah (www.FMITI.gov.ng) for a roundtable discussion with U.S. business executives at their office in Washington, D.C. The conversation focused on enhancing trade and investment relationship between both countries. This comes in the context of a telephone call between President Muhammadu Buhari and President Donald Trump Monday, where both Presidents discussed security and economic issues. It is seen as suggesting the U.S. consideration of Nigeria as a strategic partner. “The U.S. has historically been one of Nigeria’s top trading partners; it was the biggest importer of Nigeria’s crude oil at some point. In the last five years, however, the sharp decline in U.S. imports of our crude, on account of rising domestic production of shale, has altered the trade balance between our two countries. This development presents Nigeria with a good opportunity for diversification and to explore and increase non-oil export – especially in agricultural products, services and the digital economy,” said Minister Enelamah. On his part, the President of the U.S.-Africa Business Center and Vice President for African Affairs at the Chamber Scott Eisner, stated that “With the largest economy in Africa, Nigeria is an important partner for U.S. businesses. Our conversation highlighted the work being done to strengthen the economic relationship between our two countries and how we can continue to build on this relationship.” Enelamah also participated in a Facebook Live conversation with the U.S.-Africa Business Center following the roundtable. Some of the companies that attended the gathering include Google, Microsoft, Blackstone, Procter and Gamble, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Boston Scientific, Philip Morris International, Lekoil Oil, ITIC, etc. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations. Its International Affairs division includes more than 70 regional and policy experts and 25 country-and region-specific business councils and initiatives. The U.S. Chamber also works closely with 117 American Chambers of Commerce abroad. The U.S.-Africa Business Center is the preeminent voice in the global business community advocating for increased trade between the United States and Africa. After the roundtable, the Minister went on to attend events focusing on the Ease of Doing Business and Investment at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Hudson Institute. He answered questions from a mixed audience of business executives, government officials, diplomats and others. He similarly had meetings at the State Department with the outgoing Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Linda Thomas Greenfield and U.S. Trade Representatives for Africa at the Commerce office. Issues on the agenda at the state department ranged from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), SMEs, Nigeria’s leadership on the Continent and continued engagement with the new administration, while the commerce office focused on trade and the WTO. Minister Enelamah was accompanied by his Trade Adviser and Chief Negotiator Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe, Special Adviser Bunmi Adeoye and Strategic Communications Adviser, Constance C. Ikokwu.

The same will be made available on the Company's website at the following weblink https://www.infosys.com/investors/news-events/events/Documents/chasing-growth-conference-13feb2017.pdf This is for your information and records. Yours sincerely, For Infosys Limited A G S Manikantha Company Secretary Kotak Chasing Growth Conference February 13, 2017 CORPORATE PARTICIPANTs Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Moderator: Our next speaker is Dr. Vishal Sikka. Dr. Vishal Sikka is the current CEO and Managing Director of Infosys, a globally recognized innovative and business leader in the IT Services Industry. Dr. Sikka was born and raised in India. He studied Computer Science at Syracuse University before receiving his Ph.D. in AI Stanford in 1996. After a very long successful stint at SAP in 2014, he joined Infosys as CEO to help drive a massive transformation not only at Infosys but also within the larger IT services industry. In the last two and half years since he took over, his vision and leadership has helped accelerate Infosys transformation resulting into growth of their global work force to almost 2 lakh people. There was a massive reduction in attrition, doubling of large deal total contract value, number of large clients and industry leading cash flows generation with revenues of $9.5 billion despite strong headwinds. Infosys new software and new services has seen tremendous growth as well. Client satisfaction levels are accordingly at the highest levels ever, particularly at the CXO segment which according to Infosys Annual Survey showed 22 points increase.  May I invite Dr. Vishal Sikka to talk about Infosys and the future of IT Services Dr. Vishal Sikka: Thank you so much. That was quite a handful introduction. Hi, Mr. Kotak. Good to see all of you. Uday has asked me to organize my talk in two sections. In the first part I want to talk about our performance and financial metrics that most of you care a lot about and then following I want to spend some time looking at the bigger picture. I hope to finish this speech itself in another 25 minutes and then leave around half an hour for your questions.     Two and half years ago, when I started, we laid out a relatively straight forward strategy. The idea was to launch a three-part strategy of renewing the core business entering into new businesses and the culture of the company. And the interesting part about this three-part strategy was also that it reflects the challenges of our clients the challenges of business that they have this dual priority of only one hand getting better at everything that they did and on the other hand doing new things that they never did before. In this, they have their own timeless culture and value system that they operate on. So, if we look over the last two and half years, the execution that we have followed on this path is starting to show signs of success. I will quickly walk you through some of these metrics. The relative revenue performance compared to the industry has distinctly improved. When I joined, our revenue was significantly below the industry. It has now got up towards the top of the industry, or certainly in line with the industry. Year-on-year if you compare the first three quarters of this financial year to the last one, you see the performance there and despite the challenging environment, we have managed to keep the operating margin steady. If you look at many of the operational parameters of our business the core business utilization for the last seven quarters has been above 80% which is for the first time in a very long time in our company. The employee cost as a percentage of revenue has come down. You can see the operating cash flow as percentage of net profit is getting close to 100%. The onsite we can still do better but the subcon costs are something that are continually improving. I know a lot of you have questions around the visa policies and things like this, we can talk about that in the Q&A but our endeavor has been to get closer to the 30% number. In terms of the core business, IT services continue to grow through a dedicated focus on renewing our existing services through a combination of automation and innovation as well as mixing our portfolio increasingly towards more high value, value add kind of services. One area of disappointment for us has been the consulting business. We continue to focus on this over the course this year. The negative performance of consulting in Q1 impacted us more than we expected. Products, platforms and other areas of the business also continue to grow and here is a different cut on that. If you look from the time when I started to last quarter, revenue per quarter has grown by more than $400 million per quarter.  While the margin is same from 25.1% to 25.1%, operating profits has gone up from $536 million to $640 million. Attrition has come down significantly from 23.4% at a group level in the quarter when I joined to now a little bit below 15%. There is a separate attrition metric that we have started to internally focus on over the last year which is high performer attrition and that number has come down significantly to single-digits. Revenue per FTE is one of the key metrics of our strategy. While it has decreased compared to when I started, it has in the last couple of quarters started to go back up and that is something we are very happy about. One key part of the strategy is the new software. When we talk about renew and new, there are new services in unprecedented new areas and there are also new software that we did not have before. Excluding Finacle, the software revenue in the quarter when I started was $35 million a quarter and that number has already gone up to $60 million now. The $100 million accounts went up from 12 to 18. $200 million accounts have doubled from 3 to 6 in that time. Organizationally Pravin and I have established a strong team around us. Jayesh is here, our Deputy CFO. Similarly, we have appointed Ravi as our Deputy COO. There are three Presidents responsible for our go to market. Below their level we have established 15 industry heads to create much more focused small encapsulated empowered business units, so that client focus and agility can be achieved and it is the best way for us to achieve scale. Similarly, we have been making a lot of progress and Pravin oversees this on simplifying our internal policies, systems and process so that we can become much more agile. So, when we look at this in the broader context of the strategy, beyond the numbers you can clearly see that on all the three dimensions of strategy things have been taking hold. One program that I am particularly proud of, I am approaching it since two years, next month it is going to be two years since we started it, is the Zero Distance. It has been deeply engrained into our company's culture. More than 95% of the projects of the company have Zero Distance plans. The idea of Zero Distance for those of you who do not know about it, is it inspires our project team to bring innovation in every single project no matter what. The number is actually 100% and the projects that do not have a Zero Distance plan are the ones that just started recently. So, if you look at the Zero Distance plans of project that started more than six weeks ago, it is 100%. Every project is basically covered by Zero Distance project and it has become a part of the culture. For the last nine months or so, we have been focusing on elevating the Zero Distance innovation idea where project teams think of bigger innovations. The CWRF is a tribute to Martin Luther King's quote that, "If you cannot fly we must run, if you cannot run we must walk, if you cannot walk we must crawl, but we have to always keep moving forward" and so we have this framework of most of the Zero Distance innovations, even though we are close to 100%, are quite incremental quite small and so our endeavor now is to elevate these towards more and more transformative innovation for our clients coming from the grass root.     Zero Bench, which was the other initiative that we launched in July of 2015 that also reached close to 100%. So basically, everyone on the bench has done a Zero Bench project. We have now more than 34,000 jobs on our internal market place. 470 jobs show up every week on this and it has touched basically everybody on the bench. As I mentioned earlier, one of the direct impacts of Zero Bench is giving the youngsters an opportunity to get some experience by working on a Zero Bench project. That experience then makes it easier for them to get into production. So, Zero Bench has had a direct impact on the utilization, especially on the fresher utilization. The utilization is above 80% consistently now, but in particular the fresher utilization and off-shore utilization has gone up directly as a result of Zero Bench. The renewal of our existing core business, in particular the maintenance and run parts of the business but also to some degree the build parts of the business is impacted by automation. I mentioned, in the earnings in January that more than 2,600 people over the course of Q3 were saved but 2,650 FTE worth of effort was eliminated with automation. Over the last 12 months that number has crossed 8,000. The Mana platform plays a very important role in helping us achieve that automation. All 8,500 is not due to Mana but Mana for IT has a huge impact on bringing automation led productivity improvements to our work. And within our core business, we have launched many new services like the Mainframe Modernization, the API Economy, BI Renewal, the work with Salesforce.com, ServiceNow, etc. Roughly 10 or so of these have launched in the last couple of years and they have all been showing growth that is faster than the growth in the company. As a result of all of this, the client satisfaction, a survey done since last 12 years, has demonstrated the highest ever score this time. In particular, as you said in the introduction, the CXO satisfaction has jumped up by 22 points.      So, I am quite proud of the work that our team has done in renewing our core business. When you look at new, getting into new dimensions of business is something that should come easily to us. When you create something new, you do that but culturally and organizationally new is much more difficult to pull off because it is not just enough to create a separate appendage that is sitting somewhere else and doing something totally independent. You have to find a way to make these harmonious. The idea of 'Renew and New' comes from Arthur Koestler's word on creation, this idea of two habitually distinct but self-consistent frames of preference where you are doing something unprecedented in the new dimension, whereas you are continuously improving in the existing dimension. We have seen continued strong momentum in the three acquisitions that we have made Skava, Panaya and Noah, as well as the new services that we have launched organically. One of the things that we are very proud of Skava, is that beyond retail Skava has now entered into other industries in particular financial services, telecommunication, and utility. We have opened new frontiers with Skava and our home-grown Mana platform. Mana helps us renew our services in particular in maintenance and run areas. The same Mana platform also has huge applications in helping our clients build breakthrough business application of artificial intelligence. I think, having a common platform that does both is extremely important to our strategy. A lot of people in the industry build captive automation capabilities in service of their own business. When we do that, the platform would not be competitive. You have to ensure that the platform that is powering the productivity improvement of the existing business is a world class platform. Therefore, it is important to have this platform subjected to the outside world, to the light of the outside. Building breakthrough business applications on Mana is a very-very critical part of the strategy. I am really excited by what our teams are doing, what our clients are doing, all the way from CPG companies using it for revenue reconciliation and financial consolidation much faster to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, working on much better forecasting, using Mana for contract management and compliance to contracts to dynamic fraud analysis for banks and applications like that.  From new services dimension, our digital services as well as the strategic design consulting services are things that have been going forward quite well. One key part of our strategy is the cultural dimension and there are two main parts to that. One is the agility of the company as a whole and the other one is education. Infosys always had a very strong emphasis on education. Mr. Murthy always talked about this. The idea of learnability, the ability to learn. Especially in the times ahead, learnability is going to be a very critical thing for our future. So, when you look at all the work that we do in culture dimension, it is dominated by this. ILP, the Infosys Learning Platform that is our own platform to very immersively teach our fresher as well as our regular employees what is going on in the world around in a very immersive way. We drop them into boot camps, into projects and into sub-sets of the projects, so they are learning in a much more accelerated way. We have done a lot of innovation in learning itself and how people learn and so forth and brought that into ILP. One of the most interesting program that we have done is for our top 200 executives. We have done a global leadership program together with Stanford and we have now done three cohorts of this. Some of the Infoscions and the senior executive who go through this, have said that this is the best thing they have done in their entire Infosys career. This is a two-and-a-half-week program or distributed over a year which is done together with the Stanford Business School, and the Stanford School of Engineering and Design School. It has a huge impact on changing the perspective of our management team.  As well as we have been investing in on-site learning and I think more and more as we focus on-site creating on-site environment for learning is going to be critical. Design thinking training has become an integral part of being at Infosys. We have now more than 130,000 Infoscion who have been trained on design thinking. By the end of this year I expect that we will be able to train everyone in the company on design thinking and similarly training in artificial intelligence, agile methodologies, and in all manner of new technologies is something that we continue to invest in. In a nutshell, two and half years going from $8.2 billion in revenue or so to now we just crossed $10 billion on a LTM basis, continued protection of margins and continued to ensure that we have strong margins. That is the philosophy of consistent profitable growth. Improvement in revenue per employee despite the pressure, the commoditization, improvement in the attrition and the sense of inspiration among the employees is growing into completely new dimensions. We are now achieving new scale in the new dimensions and highest client satisfaction ever. That is basically in a nutshell from a performance point of view where we are. As I look at the journey ahead, as happy as I am looking backwards to the last two and half years, the journey ahead is even more challenging and even more interesting one. Here is a quote from my friend Bill Ruh of GE. He will be here day after tomorrow talking at the NASSCOM Event. We have been doing some amazing work together on bringing design thinking and new kinds of solutions, co-innovation, to their platform. Here is a quote from the Head of HR and the Head of Technology for Visa on how we have helped establish a dramatic new culture as well as doing our traditional services. Visa has been one of our fastest growing accounts over the last two years and it is something that we are particularly proud of.     So as I said, as good as it is to look backwards and feel good about this dimensions of improvement that we have managed to achieve, the world around us is growing through a very rapid transformation. I want to switch gears a little bit and share with you some thoughts on what I see happening in the world around us. It is difficult to capture what is going on in a nutshell, but it basically has three dimensions. A very deep rooted sense of end user centricity. When you look at retail or banking or insurance or communications and telco and so forth. In any industry there is a very deep rooted sense in which things are becoming more connected. A continuous connection to the end user and serving end user needs has never been more important. These experiences are now increasingly becoming digital but they are also being powered by AI technology.  Underneath this enablement of the new experience is the intelligent infrastructure. It is governed by this exponential laws. I am calling it Moore's Laws, I know it is Moore's Law but I am calling it Moore's Laws because there are many of the similar laws not only in the performance improvement or cost performance improvement of processors but in many other dimensions of technology. We see these exponential price performance improvement. As a result of that, computing is becoming far more pervasive and that is all enabling and extreme efficiency of disinter-mediating existing industry.    If we look into this in a little bit more detail, here are three projects done by our strategic design consulting team. I mentioned, in the new dimension of our strategy, this one service that we offer where we co-innovate with our clients on things that are the most important to their future. On the right-hand side is a 3D printed fully functioning replica of a low fidelity model of a GE engine that is an aircraft engine. The entire engine is 3D printed and with a Microsoft HoloLens, you can deeply examine the operational behavior of this engine. You can go back and change its design parameters, tune its design parameters and you can do predictive maintenance on it. All of that in real time. It actually has the potential to dramatically accelerate the lifecycle of these engines to dramatically redesign the nature of maintenance and repair on these engines. And also make the entire machine far more connected and far more intelligent, as it goes through its lifecycle. In the middle, you see a project that we have done with a very large agriculture company. This is a digital farm that we have built. Our team actually builds the farm. It is not only a digital farm, but it is a highly affordable digital farm that can be put together with extremely cheap components and it makes the plant itself connected. Supply of nutrient, supply of water, supply of light to the plants can be controlled thousands of times more effectively than in traditional agriculture. Instead of supplying water once a day or twice a day you can supply it two thousand times in a day by milliliters individually to the plant. The CEO of this company have told me that Vishal if you are able to do this, if you are able to connect into the plant itself, we will be able to improve agricultural yield by 30%. What we found in our experience was that some of the plants actually grow 10x faster than in the normal conditions, not only 30%. The entire Green Revolution that happened in our lifetimes, in my lifetime here in India, was at 22% improvement in agricultural yield. So, you can imagine what kind of a revolution this can create. On the left hand side is actually a store that we have built for one of our luxury retail client and this is an entire store that looks like a store from 1850's but it is completely digital. Every aspect of the store, every part of this is digital. It is like a complete room, it is a large computer that is programmable, those mirrors and the coat hangers, and the closets, and everything that you see is all completely digital. The mirror turns on when you put on a coat. It knows what coat it is. You can see yourself in different circumstances and things of this nature. So, all industries are going through this deep transformation because of a very deep rooted understanding of users enabled by a pervasive connectivity and pervasive computing. This is powered by Moore's Laws rapid advance. Moore's Law this year is going to be 52 years old,   two years older than me. It is one of the extraordinary feats of human engineering achievement. Many people say that Moore's Laws is reaching its end. It is true that traditional Moore's Laws is reaching its end. On the upper right, you see a 7 nanometer wafer that DFMC has started to produce on a non-production scale yet. In early 2018, they will go production on 7 nanometers. When I spent summer at Intel working in the Intel AI Lab in 1990, I remember the micron process was going live, that was 1,000 nanometers. When I was building HANA at SAP we were at 22 nanometers process of Intel. Now it is down to 7 nanometers. This is an extraordinary thing. Of course, the reason people say that Moore's Laws is going to end is that 7 nanometers is getting already pretty close to physical scale. There are two silicon atoms in 1 nanometer, so at 7 nanometers you are basically at the width of 14 or so silicon atoms. So, there is not much more that you can get out of this. Probably by 2022, 2023 we will have 4 nanometers, 5 nanometer process but that is as far as it will grow. But then other things are happening. On the left-hand side in the middle you see the neuromorphic board that has already been made by Jenn Hasler at Georgia Tech. These neuromorphic boards are ways of bypassing the traditional CMOS manufacturing process and going into new kinds of chip design. So therefore, some other new way continuing Moore's Laws is going to continue post 2024.   On the bottom middle you see the Nvidia AI Box that has 170 teraflops box of computing in it, two Intel processors of 20 cores and 12 or so of these Tesla GPU chips inside it. This is already shipping, a lot of the deep learning algorithms run on this kind of path. And then of course on the bottom right you see this incredible growth that our partner AWS have had. That is a data center picture of a part of the datacenter of Amazon. They have dozens of datacenter, each one between 50,000 servers and 80,000 servers and collectively somewhere between 3 million servers to 5 million servers in AWS. This is an astonishingly large amount of computing capacity and AWS has seen 40%-45% growth in the last 12 months. So, what we see is that this entire digitization and AI revolution is being powered by computing that is simply exploding. Even though the traditional Moore's Laws is nearing a trend in the next seven-eight years, the new kind of architectures and new kinds of technologies is going to ensure that we are going to grow significantly further beyond that. As a result, new AI technologies are becoming possible. We all heard about this AlphaGo from Google last year that beat the world champion Go player. Recently the news came out that some students from CMU have put together a Poker playing robot. Now, why was Go significant last year, because Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in the middle of 90's. That was more or less a Brute Search computational capability exercise because the computer can look ahead in the Chess moves much more than the human brain can. Go is a different kind of a game. The computational complexity of Go is much worse then of Chess. With AlphaGo they were able to overcome that by bringing learning into that. A new frontier has been broken. Poker is based on human intuition, on deception, on bluffing and things like this. It actually has beaten four of the top Poker players continuously and has earned something like $1.7 million as a Poker player online. So, this is quite an interesting development. On the left-hand side, you see the autonomous car from Toyota which actually learns the driver's behavior as you drive the car and adjust itself to that. So, this is a great advancement that has happened in autonomous driving. Udacity has a car that is fully programmable by the students of Udacity who take the autonomous driving car class on Udacity. On the right-hand side is open AI which is a consortium of research in artificial intelligence in the public good. I am very proud that we, at Infosys are one of the sponsors of open AI. Universe is a package that the open AI team has released recently. It has now 45 world class researchers and they are really doing some amazing work in artificial intelligence. As a result of all of this, basically what we see, that it becomes much easier for a new comer to come in and disrupt in industry. Big parts of the supply chain and of the value chain can be disrupted and can be digitized. The world of atoms where we have been coming from, has huge numbers of intermediary. As digitization and computing replaces these atoms with bits, you can see that the value chain can be much more connected and can be much more zero distance. It can be much more efficient as a result of that, both in terms of pricing and in terms of production. So, this is what is going on. As a result of that, when we look at the journey ahead for us, a lot more needs to be done. I studied artificial intelligence as a graduate student. There are two pieces of research that our team picked out. One is from McKenzie that was done a few months ago, going through various kinds of jobs and the potential of automation in those jobs. The other is the impact of automation in the IT BPO industry, in our industry, that was done by HFS Research recently. And you can see that India, according to this study has the biggest impact of jobs among all of these countries. There are dozens of studies like this. If you research you can find out that recently, couple of weeks ago McKenzie Global published another one and Eric Reynoldson and Andy have done something. There are dozens and dozens of reports on automation. But really all you have to do is walk into any one of our floors at any company in the IT BPO industry and it becomes starkly clear as you walk around the floor that a huge number of these jobs are going to go away. It may not be two years it might be four years, five years, seven years, ten years, but there is no doubt that these jobs are going to be replaced with automation. So, what do we do? What is the nature of the journey that we are on? My sense is that there is only one way forward. Professor Mashelkar use to have this beautiful line "doing more with less for more" that is basically the nature of the endeavor. If you look at the complexity of human activity and plot that against time, the natural course of event is that we have to constantly be moving upward.  That journey upwards is not only a journey upwards, it is actually accelerating.     There is a very straight forward duality that we have to follow. On one hand, we have to eliminate our work through automation and improve our productivity while on the other hand we have to deploy that improved productivity towards innovation. This is basically the formula. The reason for automation is so that we can continue to do the work that has already been commoditized more efficiently and more productively and used that improvement in productivity, become more innovative to do the new kinds of things for which there is still tremendous opportunity and tremendous value. Self-driving car engineered today is worth millions of dollars. What if we were able to produce a hundred thousand self-driving autonomous driving engineers? This continues productivity improvement but actually shifting continuously from things that are commoditizing towards things that are innovative is the basic point that has to be fueled by education. This idea that we study for the first 21 years of our life and then we do not study any more, we have to abandon this idea because technology will continually change. So we have to continuously re-skill ourselves. Thankfully we at Infosys have a tremendous advantage on this because we have always had a culture of learnability like I said. So, the fueling of this automation and innovation journey on the basis of education is the key. The other basis is software. It is the intellectual property. If all we did was moving upwards on the basis of education, which alone will also become commoditized over time. Therefore, we have to take advantage of this improving productivity using software, using our software, software that is monetized. Instead of 10 people doing something if you now get that same thing done with three people, if you do not have your own software to do the work of the remaining seven then you are losing value and somebody else who made that software is capturing that value. Therefore, that software has to be monetizable. But for that software to be monetizable, it is software that has to be world class. It is software that has to withstand the test of outside world. It cannot just be a captive thing that you do only for yourself. So, having software together with education powering this transformation is something that is critical for our future. This is why the same Mana platform applies to the renewal of our services and for the breakthrough new business solution. This is the reason why education for our traditional services as well as in the breakthrough new areas is something that is critical. So this in essence is the nature of our journey in the future. John McCarthy the father of artificial intelligence once said, in a lecture that "articulating a problem is half the solution". That lecture changed the course of my life. Within our lifetimes, we are going to see AI Technology and get to the point where a well-articulated problem, a well-specified problem will be solved automatically. The human frontier at that point is going to be problem finding, creativity, the ability to look at a situation and see what is not there, to see what is missing, see what can be innovated, that is our future. One way or the other it is going to happen. When I look at 3.7 million people in our industry the only future I see is a future that is fueled by automation and getting ahead of this curve of automation. I see the future where the automation enables us to be more innovative to exercise our creativity, to exercise our ability and to find problems, not only solve them. If we do that we will be okay, if we do not we will get disrupted. This is the journey that I see in front of us. So, I do not know how long I went on, Uday. We laid out a clear strategy. We have seen signs of early success but the world is going through a very rapid change driven by AI and Technology. Much more is still to be done to lead in the next generation of IT and with focused execution we will do it. Thank you. Moderator:                Thank you, Mr. Sikka. Okay, we have the first question already. Participant:                Very nice presentation. My first question is that, how much of the value in this transformation will be captured by the software versus the services company? I understand that Infosys is trying to adopt software plus services model but when you look at the overall value chain it is the software company that are gaining bigger and bigger share of the overall value in this transformation. Dr. Vishal Sikka:       Our core business is services. We are a services company. But it is the software just like there is software-defined networking and software-defined datacenter and software-defined in retail and similarly there is software-defined services. So, we are talking about amplifying our services ability through the use of software, through the use of automation and by moving up in the value chain. So it is both, the value of the software itself will be there but it is more in services, where the real power will come from. And you see that in the numbers already. The productivity improvement in the first nine months of this financial year, compared to the first nine months of the last financial year. Last financial year in the first nine months we hired 17,500 people, this financial year's first nine months we hired something like 5,500 people, and yet we improved utilization, we improved revenue and RPE and so on and so forth. So, more with less for more, powered by software and education. Participant:                The second question that I have is something which is on top of everyone's mind, that how is your relationship with the founders and what does it mean for Infosys? Vishal Sikka:             My relationship with the founders, it is wonderful. I meet Mr. Murthy quite frequently. I do not meet the other founders quite as frequently. I ran into Kris the other day in a Lufthansa flight and I have not seen Nandan for more than a year. But it is an amazing relationship. I have a heartfelt warm relationship with Mr. Murthy. I probably meet him four, five, six times a year, something like this. He is an incredible man, we usually talk about quantum physics and things like this and technology. He was telling me the other day about the Paris metro and how he worked on the Paris metro in the 1970s before he started Infosys. It had this whole idea of automation of autonomous driving and things like this. So, all this drama that has been doing on in the media, it is very distracting. It takes our attention, but underneath that there is a very strong fabric that this company is based on and it is a real privilege for me to be its leader. Participant:                Hi Vishal, great presentation. I was curious if you could talk about, from your personal experiences over the last two and a half years, you have been turning around a really large ship. What have been your deepest personal experiences, what have been most difficult to accomplish, what have been easy to accomplish? And in light of that, if you think I were to ask the same question from the leaders of the smaller mid-tier IT services companies, what do you think they would likely say? Vishal Sikka:             The second question I cannot answer. Compared to two and a half years ago, to me, it is disappointing to see the rate of growth and embrace of automation in the industry. I think more should have been done by now, but that is my opinion. When it comes to Infosys, it has actually been quite counter intuitive. I would not have imagined that zero distance would get picked up the way it did. One month after I started, I think September or October of 2014, this customer satisfaction survey came out, and it was incredibly depressing. I actually got the details of customers, the client's feedback, it was a pile of paper that thick, and I read it over a period of one month. I read every single one of them. Consistently it was the same story that we used to get high marks on quality, on delivery excellence, on being responsive, being professional. And we would get the lowest scores on strategic relevance, on innovation, on being proactive, and it was a shock to me that that was the case. So, a lot of the ideas for Zero Distance formed in those four, five months, and by March of 2015 I launched it. Within nine months we had managed to create a very grass roots oriented culture around that. Recently, Ravi, our Head of Delivery, was talking to some youngsters and they told him that it is not a new thing for us anymore, we just assume that it is a part of our job to come up with something innovative in whatever project that we are doing. That to me has been the biggest positive. The bringing of design thinking at a very massive scale has been surprisingly easy because of the scale. This comes from Mr. Murthy, the scale that was setup for education employees. The new, it is always difficult to embrace the new. So, I think bringing new in, in particular, letting go of your existing way of doing things and embracing. If a piece of software automates the work that you do, then embracing that piece of software and letting go of some of the manual work. It is something that is visible to you, that is something that is very difficult for people to do, and so that has been a hard thing. Some things that I thought were going to be much easier have turned out to be not so easy, some that I thought would be difficult have turned out to be much easier than I thought. Participant:                In your Vision 2020, where we are in that journey? Would inorganic be a big component of it, how products will contribute? And given the recent noise in media, how confident you are seeing through that journey? Vishal Sikka: How confident am I of what? Participant:                Of achieving that vision? Vishal Sikka: See, that $20 billion, 30%, $80,000 revenue per employee, has always been an aspiration for us. What good is an aspiration if it is not aspirational? So, we are marching down that path. When you launch something like training people on design thinking, you cannot say that we will get 100,000 people trained in the next one year or two years, you have to setup a grassroots movement and then let it go and see what happens. When you do it like that, usually it surprises you. These numbers are a consequence of the work that we do, they are not that you figure out some way to get to that number. You do the right thing and then if you do the right thing, these numbers are the footprint that we leave behind. They are the consequences of the work that we do. So, this is how we look at it. Where are we on this journey? We are still early in this journey, we still have a lot of things to deal with, we have to get the consulting endeavor right, and we have to get BPO transformed. If we talk about the Infosys transformation as a whole, BPO transformation is even more difficult because it is even lower in the ranks and the skill levels and things like this. Many of the software assets have to still be transformed, like Finacle and so forth. We are still in the early stages of that. But generally, in the renewal of the code services and the adoption of the new services, I feel very good about where we are. So now as we look ahead to the future, a new financial year is starting and so forth. We are going through this exercise of trying to think about what does the journey ahead looks like. Taking stock of the last two and a half years and figuring out what the path ahead is going to look like in terms of both the software as well as the services, and the services amplified by software and so on. Participant:                How big would be the inorganic component? Moderator:                I have to stop you, one question. Because we are running out of time. I am going to come to this side of the hall and then back to you sir. Participant:                Vishal, I understand that you are going through two huge transitions or transformations we are going to call it. One on the technology side where you articulated your walk through on floor, half the jobs would not be there in five years. On the other side, you are going through a cultural transition or transformation, a founder run company that moved in to your hands and the obvious changes that play out. I am sure this is creating a bunch of insecurity at the organization level through the different ranks. So two questions here, how do you communicate, what do you communicate through the ranks to ensure that people are calm and focused on the job. And the second is, what are the two or three key pieces of your strategy? As you are saying, two of our key foundation stones are moving around and we are probably shaking a bit. How do you make sure you anchor the ship better and navigate through this? Vishal Sikka:             I think continuous and intense communication is very important across different parts of the organization and so on. That is something that cannot be overstated. You need to just communicate, communicate and communicate. And in our case it is not easy because the onsite employees are difficult to communicate to. They are inside their client context and so forth. So it is not so straightforward. The other part of it is that you have to demonstrate by example, talk is cheap but you have to really demonstrate in work that you are focused, that you are ignoring the noise and the distractions and so forth, and continuing to stay engaged. That is something, there are natural latencies that our brains have and there is not much you can do about that. I think that organizational change, organizational transformation is important. A lot of people would say that why go through this exercise of taking the leadership team through two years of a Stanford program and things like that, instead of just changing the leadership team. But if you change the leadership team then what happens to the layers below. You create a complete disruption, and not to mention you missed the point of transformation that is supposed to happen. So, I think that creating a context, creating an atmosphere which elevates everybody is something that is exceedingly important. Elan Kay says that context is worth 80 IQ points. So, if we build a real context around us that elevates everybody and can have the biggest transformative effect that takes time. The benefit of that approach is that it is very sustainable, long-term, lasting approach. The drawback is that it takes time. It is easy to plant a company here or there, buy some companies, put them inside and hire some leaders and put them inside, but that is like appendages growing out of control out of you. That is not sustained, organic transformation in the true sense. Moderator:                We have time exactly for one more brief question and one more brief answer. So try and keep your question as brief as you can. Participants:              My question is on buyback. Some of the founders have said that they have written letters to the Board on this issue and they have not heard anything. Just your views on how you plan to utilize the cash? Vishal Sikka:             The official answer is the Board from time to time will consider capital allocation policies. In the last four years we have reviewed twice, we have improved dividend payout, once from 30% to 40% and then again from 40% to 50%. When we have something to report, we will report it. Jayesh, did I miss something? Did I do a good job? Jayesh Sanghrajka:  Yes. Vishal Sikka:             But that was an official answer. The unofficial answer is that you look at the business circumstances over the next four, five years and then you look at what you need the capital for. Then based on that you decide. We will do that as necessary. In our case, it is basically three things, there are strategic growth initiatives, and there is a capital for buildings and infrastructure and so forth to house the employees. Then there is the investments, the acquisitions. I am not interested in buying yesterday's technology to make something or the other look good. We are interested in tomorrow's technology. And tomorrow's technology is usually expensive if it is really good. So, you have to be very, very selective in that. Based on how that mix changes over the next five years and based on that you take a decision on how to utilize the cash. We have done this with 50% so far and as we go through this exercise we will take a look at it. Nobody asked about visas or Donald Trump etc Moderator:                Would you like to Suo Moto answer the question about Visas and Donald Trump? Vishal Sikka:             No, there is nothing that has happened so far. Moderator:                Okay. I am afraid that concludes our session. Thank you, Dr. Sikka. Thank you for being a very responsive audience. This is a disclosure announcement from PR Newswire.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Atomico closes $765 million fund for series A-level European startups Paul Sawers@psawers February 15, 2017 10:00 PM Tags: Atomico, funding daily, Niklas Zennstrom Above: Niklas Zennström Image Credit: Atomico U.K.-based venture capital firm Atomico has closed its fourth fund at a whopping $765 million, representing one of the single biggest funds to launch out of Europe. Founded in 2006 by Skype cofounder Niklas Zennström, Atomico focuses on consumer technology companies in Europe and beyond, and counts offices in London, São Paulo, Beijing, the Cayman Islands, and Tokyo. In 2017 so far, Atomico has invested in a number of tech startups, including Swiss barcode scanning startup Scandit and Estonian sales CRM firm Pipedrive. The latest fund eclipses its previous incarnation, which was closed in 2013 at $476.6 million. Atomico revealed that it was looking to raise around $750 million for its fourth fund through a SEC filing last year, and now it has achieved that goal with a $15 million surplus. It will target European technology companies at “series A and beyond,” according to the VC firm. “We’ve advocated the strength and depth of European tech for over ten years, and Europe is now producing some of the greatest technology companies in the world,” said Zennström. “With a deep talent pool of engineers and tech hubs springing up from Lisbon to Tallinn, there’s never been a better time to be a founder in Europe.” A number of sizable funds from have emerged from and for Europe over the past couple of years. Back in 2015, Index Ventures closed a $706 million growth fund, followed by a $550 million early-stage fund a year later. Elsewhere, Lakestar closed a $400 million fund; Northzone closed a $335 million fund; Partech Ventures closed a $440 million fund, followed by another $108 million pot; and E.ventures closed a $150 million fund. In addition to the fund, Atomico has also been bolstering its investment and “value creation” teams in recent months, adding Niall Wass (formerly of Uber), Benjamin Grol (formerly of Facebook and Google), and Alexis Dormandy (formerly of Virgin and Orange). Another two “executives in residence” have been added in the past year too: Carter Adamson (formerly of Rdio and Skype) and Sophia Bendz (ex-Spotify). Atomico now claims eight investment partners and seven “value creation” partners in total. “We’ve raised one of the biggest funds, and built the best operational team, in Europe to partner with the most ambitious entrepreneurs to help them become global category winners,” added Zennström.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 16 February 2017 by Military News World Patent Marketing Success Team Presents Prime 2 Start, a Fuel Invention That Will Help Start Two-Stroke Engines Prime 2 Start is a fuel invention that will serve to start two-stroke engines by providing sufficient lubrication. The automotive industry is worth $1.7 trillion,” says Scott Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing. „This industry is on the rise due to the advancement of new technologies such as improved safety systems and self-driving vehicles. Past News Releases RSS Miami, FL February 16, 2017 World Patent Marketing, a vertically integrated manufacturer and engineer of patented products, introduces Prime 2 Start, a fuel invention designed specifically for starting two-stroke engines. “The automotive industry is worth $1.7 trillion,” says Scott Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing. „This industry is on the rise due to the advancement of new technologies such as improved safety systems and self-driving vehicles.” “There are many different kinds of engines that require different kinds of fuels,” says Jerry Shapiro, Senior Director of World Patent Marketing. “Using the wrong kind of fuel can cause damage to the engine. This fuel invention was designed specifically for two-stroke engines.” Prime 2 Start is a fuel invention that will help people who own vehicles with two-stroke engines. It is an aerosol can that made with an alcohol-free gasoline and oil mixture and can be sprayed into the engine to start it. If there is a lack of fuel in the engine, fuel can be sprayed directly into the air intake to start it and allow it to run on its own fuel supply. Prime 2 Start is a starting fuel aerosol spray can designed specifically for two-stroke engines. Most starting fuels do not have enough lubricant for two-stroke engines and using them can cause potential damage to the engine. This invention contains a formula designed to properly lubricate the engine and allow it to start without problems. Prime 2 Start will ensure that two-stroke engines work properly every time. “When I first bought my boat, I knew a lot of work had to be done as it was a very old boat with a motor which did not run,” says inventor Stephen L. “After doing repairs on the engine and wanting starting fluid for the initial startup, I searched high and low, both locally and on the internet, for a starting fluid which was safe to use on my two-stroke engine. I found many which specifically said not to use on two-stroke engines. So, out of necessity, I solved the problem by developing my own starting fluid. It has worked well and I was very satisfied with its performance.” Prime 2 Start is a fuel invention that will serve to start two-stroke engines by providing sufficient lubrication. This will replace standard fuels that are not compatible with two-stroke engines. ABOUT WORLD PATENT MARKETING World Patent Marketing is always looking for new invention ideas.

The roofing industry is worth $10 billion,” says Scott Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing. „Reroofing and weather effects are among the primary driving forces in this industry. Past News Releases RSS Miami, FL February 16, 2017 World Patent Marketing, a vertically integrated manufacturer and engineer of patented products, introduces the Solar Powered Heated Roof, a home invention that will help prevent snow from piling up on rooftops. “The roofing industry is worth $10 billion,” says Scott Cooper, CEO and Creative Director of World Patent Marketing. „Reroofing and weather effects are among the primary driving forces in this industry.” “Living in a cold area can be a challenge since the snow piles up, which can be not only inconvenient but potentially dangerous and even damage houses and vehicles,” says Jerry Shapiro, Senior Director of World Patent Marketing. “This home invention will help protect the roof during heavy snowfall.” The Solar Powered Heated Roof is a home invention that will benefit people that live in cold environments. One major problem with snow is the buildup. This can make it difficult to drive or even walk around. It can also build up on the roof and make it unsafe to even stay inside the building so it must be removed immediately. This invention was created to get the snow off the roof with minimal effort. It consists of a set of solar panels that can be placed on the roof to generate heat. It gathers clean energy from the sun and uses that energy to melt any snow that falls on the roof. This will prevent the snow from building up and becoming a potential hazard. The Solar Powered Heated Roof is a must in most snowy areas. “This invention heats your roof to keep snow off of the building so the snow will not collapse your roof,” says inventor Ryan W. The Solar Powered Heated Roof is a home invention that heats up the roof so the snow on it melts. This will prevent the snow from piling up and potentially collapsing the roof in.

Twitter/BlackBerry Blackberry's overall smartphone OS market share in Q4 2016 was 0.0481 percent. According to research firm Gartner, the smartphone company only sold 207,900 units out of about 432 million units sold worldwide. According to the Gartner Q4 2016 report, it did not include the smartphone's handsets that run Android. However, even if the Android handsets were included, the total number of units sold was still low. When compared to the Q2 2016, the number has dropped as the company sold about 400,000 units. In the Q3 2016 report, the smartphone's operating system showed a global market share of 0.1 percent. Its equivalent was 377,800 devices sold during that period. Alex Thurber, senior vice president of global sales, said that the company would still invest in its mobile operating system BB10. The company did not release any phone running BB10 OS. "BB10 has a strong following around the world in enterprise and government, as well as consumers in particular markets. I want to make sure that our customers and users don't get concerned that we're not continuing to support and invest in BB10 because we absolutely are," Thurber told the Financial Post. Google dominated the OS sales as the company sold 352.7 million smartphones running Android. The company's global market share was 81.7 percent. Apple iOS was ranked in second place for its market share of 17.9 percent. Apple sold 77 million units in Q4 2016. In Gartner's worldwide smartphone sales to end users by vendor., it showed that Apple sold 77,038 million devices having a market share of 17.9 percent. The company ranked number one in this category. However, the report showed that there was only 256,000 units difference between Samsung that ranked in second place. Samsung sold 76,782 million devices with a market share of 17.8 percent. Samsung's Q4 2015 report showed that it sold 83,437 million devices. "This is the second consecutive quarter in which Samsung has delivered falling quarterly smartphone sales. Samsung's smartphone sales declined 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and its share dropped by 2.9 percentage points year on year," Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, said. Gupta said Apple achieved the strong sales in Q4 2016 because of iPhone 7 and iPhone Plus. It also benefited from the mature markets in North America, Western Europe, Asia, Australia and South Korea with a weakened demand on Samsung handsets.

Southern Patagonia ice field seen by one of Planet's satellites. Image: planet By Miriam Kramer2017-02-12 21:17:29 UTC On Valentine's Day, instead of chowing down on chocolates, a group of engineers and scientists are going to get pancakes and a rocket launch.  Employees working for Planet — a California-based startup — are planning to watch a record 88 of their tiny satellites launch into orbit while eating breakfast.  SEE ALSO: The first photos from a revolutionary new weather satellite are gorgeous "This [pancake tradition] originated from the very first launch we had back in 2013," Mike Safyan, Planet's director of launch and regulatory affairs, said in an interview.  "It was an early morning launch and everyone got together and watched the livestream and we decided to eat pancakes and that's just kind of carried over for every single launch we've had so far." The Valentine's Day launch will be a special one for Planet, and it's not only because it will set a record for the largest clutch of satellites launched at once. (In total, the PSLV rocket carrying them will take 104 satellites to orbit.) A PSLV rocket takes flight. Image: Uncredited/AP/REX/Shutterstock After these 88 satellites — called Doves by the company — make it into orbit, they will allow it to image the entire Earth every day. It's a goal Planet has dubbed "Mission One," set back when it was founded in 2010. This will mark Planet's 15th Dove launch and will give the company a total of 100 of these satellites in orbit.  "We've had a lot of launches under our belts but this is the one that we feel really defines Mission One," Safyan said. "It's a pretty special feeling to think back [to] all those years ago when we were a scrappy team inside a garage dreaming about this day, and now this day has finally come." The new capability will allow Planet's customers to get their data more quickly,  opening the door to uses that weren't possible before. For example, organizations hoping to track deforestation could use the daily images taken by these satellites to really track, and maybe even prevent, some of that deforestation. Wheat and alfalfa fields in northern Saudi Arabia. Image: Planet "If we have an update of an area every six months, you can see change but there's not much you can do about it," Safyan added. "Whereas, if everyday you're getting an alert where trees are going down where they aren't allowed to be harvested or cut down, then you can actually go and send someone and do something about it." The photos can also be used to keep an eye on crops and create more accurate maps. Planet has had a big year.  The relatively young company just announced that it's acquiring Terra Bella, Google's satellite arm focused on capturing images of Earth. The acquisition means that Planet will also gain control of Terra Bella's seven SkySat satellites. As part of the deal, Google will buy data gathered by Planet's fleet of satellites. Planet also struck a deal that will allow the company to host data from a wealth of other satellites like Landsat-8 and RapidEye. "We firmly believe that more accessible data can help decision makers take smarter, faster action, and we’re excited to see new and meaningful applications built from this collection of datasets," Planet said in a blog post.

Mainly because they have been witness to a series of leaks pertaining to the Huawei P10. So far, a number of P10 images have surfaced the Internet in the past few days. Now, an FCC filing seems to confirm some pretty important specs that pertain to the battery of the Huawei P10. According to the FCC filing, the Huawei P10 will sport a 3,100 mAh lithium-ion battery. Although not exactly a big deal, it still shows a bit of improvement in comparison to its predecessor. The document also shows that the P10 will be equipped with an 802.11ac WiFi module as well as NFC and the standard GPS. The Huawei P10 is rumored to come with the company’s own ARM chip, the HiSilicon Kirin 960. Meanwhile, its bigger brother, the P10 Plus, will carry a more advanced chip, the Kirin 965. The Kirin 960 is an eight-core ARM processor with half of the cores based on the ARM Cortex-A73 architecture. The ARM Cortex-A73 cores run at clock speeds of 2.4GHz.  The remaining four cores are based on the ARM Cortex-A53 architecture and runs at a much lower speed of 1.8GHz. Huawei P10 FCC filing (via fccid.io) On the memory side of things, the smaller P10 is said to have a maximum of 6GB of RAM. The internal storage will be a 64GB flash for the standard version while the premium one will have as much as 128GB. The display of the smaller Huawei P10 is a 5.2-inch AMOLED panel while the P10 Plus is a 5.5-inch panel. Both smartphones will run on the current mobile operating system from Google, the Android 7.0 Nougat. At the moment, Huawei has remained quiet about how much the P10 will cost. However, consumers can expect to pay somewhere between $500 to $700 for the standard P10. Meanwhile, the Huawei P10 Plus can cost around $725 depending on the configurations. Huawei has been teasing the public about its next generation flagship phone. A few days ago, it released its official event announcement for the upcoming Mobile World Congress. The event, which will be held in Barcelona, will run from Feb. 26 until March 2. It will host a number of phone manufacturers including Huawei.
