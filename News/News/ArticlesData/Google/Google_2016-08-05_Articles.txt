Urmson is now ready for a fresh challenge after leading 1.8 million miles of autonomous driving.  ( Chris Urmson | Medium ) Advertisement Google Self-Driving Car Project CTO Chris Urmson, who has been working on autonomous vehicle technology at the company for over seven years, has announced his departure. Urmson, a research scientist from Carnegie Mellon University, joined Google back in 2009 to help in the development of the then-secret project. He took over leadership of the initiative in 2013 after Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google X research laboratory, left the company. Urmson posted on Medium regarding his departure, as he looked back on the many accomplishments that the Google Self-Driving Car Project has made over the past years. He recalled that when he joined Google, the first milestone of the project was to have its modified Prius vehicles drive autonomously over distances of 100,000 miles, with those first trips not exactly going as smoothly as was hoped. The project was able to learn significant lessons over the years, leading to the decision to manufacture the prototype vehicles of the Google Self-Driving Project. The cars, which were rolled out last year, were the first ones to be designed from scratch for self-driving purposes. "Now, 1.8 million miles of autonomous driving later, I've decided the time is right to step down and find my next adventure," Urmson wrote, adding that he is now ready for a fresh challenge after leading Google's self-driving cars over the human equivalent of 150 years worth of driving. "Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this lifesaving technology will soon become a reality," wrote Alphabet spokesman Johnny Luu in an e-mail, adding that the company sends Urmson their warmest wishes as he leaves. The X research laboratory, under which Google's Self-Driving Car Project operates, has been facing increased pressure to reveal financial returns for their efforts. While the project has been leading the development of autonomous vehicle technology, a version of the vehicle that can be sold to customers is likely still several years away. Google hired John Krafcik, former CEO and President of Hyundai America to become the project's CEO last year. Urmson, however, has expressed unhappiness under Krafcik's leadership, and has privately quarreled with Alphabet CEO Larry Page over the direction of the project. Urmson took a leave for the summer, and has only recently come to the decision to part ways with the project. He, however, disputed that the disagreements with Krafcik and Page were a reason for his decision to leave. In addition to Urmson, two other executives of the project are dropping from the project, with principal software engineer and one of the project's founders Jiajun Zhu co-founding a startup along with software lead Dave Ferguson. What is next for the Google Self-Driving Car Project after these departures? "I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands," Urmson wrote in his Medium post, signifying that it is business as usual for those who are still working on Google's self-driving car. The people working on the project have chosen to focus on autonomous vehicle technology over many other possible products as they understand the impact that the vehicle could have in the everyday lives of millions of people. Urmson promised that he will be cheering for the project and following its progress, as Google continues to work on getting the self-driving car to market. Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt recently claimed that the project will be ready in years, not decades, and so we will see how the Google Self-Driving Car Project unfolds.

[Video] 5 August 2016, 9:58 am EDT By Anu Passary Tech Times Pokemon Go - 5 Things You Should KnowNow Playing Pokemon Go - How To Choose Your TeamNow Playing Google is celebrating the 2016 Rio Olympics - which kicks off on Aug. 5 - with interactive Olympic-themed mini games. Dubbed the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games, the new interactive Doodle will have gamers playing each day for the next two weeks.  ( Googledoodles | YouTube ) Advertisement Google is celebrating the 2016 Rio Olympics, and to mark the occasion, it has debuted a series of mini games that - you guessed it right - have the Olympics as its theme. The Olympic-themed interactive doodles are dubbed 2016 Doodle Fruit Games and will kick off alongside the 2016 Rio Olympics, which starts on Friday, Aug. 5, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. "The summer just got sweeter. Today marks the season opener of the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games. For the next couple of weeks in the latest Google app for Android and iOS, journey to an otherwise unassuming fruit stand in Rio, where produce from all over the market are ripe to compete for the title of freshest fruit," notes the company in a blog post. So over the next two weeks you will be able to engage in mini games that feature fruits like strawberry, pineapple, pear or watermelon and go bananas as they compete against each other in track and field, as well as activities that test skill, stamina and strength. The prize? The glory of being the "freshest fruit." Google will update the Doodle with a new game each day in the next two weeks, giving enthusiasts a chance to engage in a new mini game every day. The Doodle is essentially a video where the fruits are playing. When the Doodle ends, one will see that a game similar to the Doodle has been released that day. The game will be available for free for both iOS and Android users. The games, however, will only be playable on Google's app. The 2016 Doodle Fruit Games will appear once a user opens their Google app on either the Android or iOS device and click the Google Doodle. The games range from hurdles, tennis, mini golf, swimming to water polo - all with a fruity twist! The player needs to maneuver the fruits through the different courses. Once the event or game ends, they are ranked with stars - one to three. Quite a few of the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games require the gamer to control it by tilting their iOS or Android device. You can control the direction by adjusting the device's angle in many games. This is not the first Olympic special Google has come up with. We reported a few days ago that Google added highlights across YouTube, Search and Maps to keep people stay abreast on all the Olympic action. Download the Google app for iOS or Android now to play the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games. TAG Google, 2016 Rio Olympics, Google Doodle © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Tampa Bay Times: Subscribe Make Payment/Renew Missed Paper Vacation Stop E-Paper TBO: Advertise Contact Us AUTOS HOMES JOBS Tuesday, Nov 22, 2016 77° Home Local News US & World Sports Entertainment Radar Weather Special Sections Offbeat Stories With world as its playground, Pokémon Go pushes legal, ethical bounds Pokemon Go players are glued to their phones as they walk the shore at Ballast Point Park. The city of Tampa is still waiting for a reply to its request that the maker of the game cut back on the virtual creatures that draw players to the park. [ZACK WITTMAN | Times] Tony Marrero, Times Staff Writer Published: August 6, 2016 Updated: August 6, 2016 at 11:29 PM They’ve descended on cemeteries, veterans memorials and the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. In their zeal to catch digital creatures that pop up on their smartphone screens, Pokémon Go players are flocking to places where they’re not always welcome. Niantic, the game’s developer, is fielding requests from exasperated property owners who want the company to remove virtual markers that draw crowds to real-world places. The city of Tampa, for example, has asked the company to take the “PokéStops” out of Ballast Point Park because so many players are showing up when the park is closed. The friction raises questions about the technology that makes the augmented reality game possible. How much responsibility does Niantic bear for the actions of people using its product? And what obligation, if any, does the company have to respond to requests like Tampa’s? Experts say the company may have the law on its side, at least for now, but the popularity of Pokémon Go has pushed Niantic into uncharted legal and ethical waters. “The question is, how far does a third party like Niantic have to go before it becomes responsible for encouraging players to trespass or create a nuisance,” said Brian Wassom, a media attorney and author of Augmented Reality Law, Privacy, and Ethics. “That’s an untested legal question.” ••• You might not care about the difference between a Charmander and a Jigglypuff, but to understand why players are mobbing a waterfront park in tony South Tampa, you need a primer on Pokémon Go. The goal of the game, which is based on the original Nintendo game of the 1990s and downloaded as a mobile app, is to capture Pokémon creatures that pop up on the screen. The game uses the phone’s camera so the characters appear to surface in the real world. In map view, the player’s avatar, Pokémon characters and game markers appear on a digital map. At PokéStops, players can replenish their avatar’s supplies and drop “lures” that cause Pokémon creatures to appear. At PokéGyms, players pit their captured critters against each other in on-screen battles. The app uses the phone’s GPS function with Niantic’s proprietary mapping software. Niantic developed the software for its first augmented reality game, Ingress, which launched in 2011. That game didn’t catch on like Pokémon Go. “The technology has been around for several years, but it’s been the enthusiasts using it, not the masses,” said Mark Skwarek, director of New York University’s Augmented Reality Lab. Skwarek has worked on augmented reality for more than a decade and has worked on GPS-based games like Pokémon Go. Niantic was formed in 2010 by John Hanke as Niantic Labs, an internal startup within the Internet and technology giant Google, before it was spun out as an independent entity last fall. Hanke was one of the founders of Keyhole, the company Google bought to start Google Earth. Hanke was involved with Google Maps before forming Niantic. As it developed Ingress, Niantic built a huge database of real-world landmarks that later became the starting point for Pokémon Go, according to the technology magazine Mashable. The company uses another set of data based on geographic markers, such as bodies of water, to decide where certain Pokémon characters will appear. After the game launched in the United States last month, word spread quickly on social media that Ballast Point Park was one of the best places in the area to play. The 7.5-acre park has several PokéStops — players have reported as many as nine — and at least one PokéGym. But the attraction transcends the plentiful Pokémon. Players say rare characters that can’t be found anywhere else in the city appear regularly at Ballast Point. This has proved an irresistible draw for players who disregard the sign noting the park is open only from dawn to dusk. Neighbors call to complain and police show up to disperse crowds that reached 150 one night last month. Public parks, with their easy access and open spaces, are a natural playground for augmented reality games, Skwarek said. So Niantic puts an extra focus on parks, dropping virtual goodies there to draw players. “They see these as places to really hype up the game,” he said. But how do places less appropriate for game playing, like the National Holocaust Museum and cemeteries, wind up with PokéStops? An algorithm that automatically pulled landmarks from maps is probably to blame, Skwarek said. Niantic can easily intervene to make manual changes, he said. It’s usually as simple as highlighting the features on a digital map and clicking “delete” or removing the coordinates from a spreadsheet. Niantic has an electronic form on its website for property owners who want the company to remove stops and gyms. The company declined to answer emailed questions from the Times about what criteria the company uses to evaluate the requests and how long it takes to respond. Instead, a spokesman referred a reporter to a previously issued statement that Niantic is “moving quickly to review all such requests.” Published reports show the forms are being submitted from all over the world. Niantic honored a request from the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. In a Web post last week, officials in Provo, Utah, said they were surprised at how quickly the company granted their request to remove stops from the public library. But a cathedral in Germany has threatened legal action because the company has not responded to its requests. Tampa officials have said they don’t want people to stop playing the game at Ballast Point Park, but made the request to Niantic as a “proactive” way to try to make the park less of draw and reduce crowds. As of Friday, the problems there hadn’t abated and the city was still waiting for a response, police spokesman Steve Hegarty said. ••• There is no law against placing virtual markers in a physical space, even private property, said Wassom, the attorney. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that online expression is a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. “If someone were placing physical signs saying, ‘Come here and play,’ that would be a pretty clear violation of property rights,” he said. “But when you’re putting virtual markers on a digital map, you’re engaging in speech, and that’s protected.” But just as there limitations on free speech, the right to place virtual markers is not absolute, Wassom said. He said there will be some instances where a virtual marker is viewed as a “clear and present danger,” similar to yelling fire in a crowed theater, but in most cases, that’s going to be “an awfully uphill battle to fight,” he said. “Whenever you’re talking about physical trespassing, the responsibility is always going to be on the person committing the act,” he said, noting that the Pokémon Go app tells players not to trespass or enter dangerous areas. Some cities already are considering new laws and at least one has passed. The City Council in Newnan, Ga., adopted an ordinance July 21 — just two weeks after the game launched — prohibiting people from playing Internet or cellphone games in the city’s three cemeteries. Wassom expects similar ordinances to follow. Some will be well thought out but most will face court challenges, he said. Legal or not, companies like Niantic have a duty to be good corporate citizens, said Dan Verreault, director of the Center for Ethics in the University of Tampa’s Sykes School of Business. “The company has to be responsible and careful in the design, and responsive and accepting of feedback from affected communities,” Verreault said. “I also think at least 50 percent of the responsibility has to be taken by the user who knows that catching a little dinosaur doesn’t justify trespassing or disturbing what ought not be disturbed.” For cases like Ballast Point Park, Niantic could craft a compromise, such as adjusting the game so its features better align with park hours, said NYU’s Skwarek. He said the popularity of the game probably caught the company by surprise and it’s probably adding staff to make these kinds of changes. “You have to work with the public on these issues,” Skwarek said, “or it’s going to backfire when something bad happens.” Times senior news researcher John Martin contributed to this report.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.32pm EDT 17:32 The U.S. isn’t playing with LeBron James or Steph Curry, but every player on the team is well-known. China’s most recognizable names are Yi Jianlian, a 7-footer who was the No. 6 overall pick by the Bucks in 2007 (and then had five forgettable NBA seasons), and Zhou Qi, a 2015 2nd Round pick by the Rockets. Qi, who is 7-foot-2, had 15 points and 3 rebounds combined in the two exhibition games against the U.S. That’s not too far off from Dwight Howard-level production, so that’s something for Houston to maybe get excited about. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.23pm EDT 17:23 Welcome to the liveblog of the opening game of the Rio 2016 Men’s Basketball competition for the United States and China. I’d love to say we’re in for a great game, but for most every U.S. basketball game at the Olympics since 1992, the question isn’t if they’ll win but by how much. The US and China met twice in late July in exhibition games and the US won by scores of 106-57 and 107-57. So, yes, it’s a safe bet that Team USA will win by quite a bit tonight. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.26pm EDT 14:26 DJ will be here shortly. In the meantime, it’s worth asking: is this USA team invincible? This collection of NBA players might not be as impressive as the 1992 Dream Team, or even the 2012 team, but there’s seemingly no way they’ll miss out on a gold medal. The biggest threats to American basketball hegemony – Spain, Argentina, and France – are all trotting out players who are well past their prime. Lithuania might be a team to fear in 2020, once Domantas Sabonis has logged a few years in the NBA, but a victory over the USA seems highly unlikely. With very little doubt hovering over the results of the tournament, the only thing to watch for in Rio is what I like to call the International Bounce. It’s like the US presidential convention bounce, but for basketball prowess. In the 2014 World Cup of Basketball, Cousins dominated and signaled that he’d be taking a step up once the season started. Of course, he didn’t and the Kings were abysmal yet again, but the hype was there over the summer. Do you remember that Carlos Boozer, Tayshaun Prince, and Michael Redd were on the 2008 Redeem Team? For players like that who aren’t perennial All-Stars and don’t win MVP awards, the International Bounce can be a career-defining moment. With this team having so many Olympic first-timers, there’s going to be a lot of guys with a lot to prove. The US Olympic men's basketball team is nearly invincible: what's to gain in Rio?

Banglalink Muhammad Zahidul Islam The international community is impressed with the progress made by Bangladesh in digitisation, said two top telecom experts. Houlin Zhao, secretary general of International Telecommunication Union, and Augie K Fabela, co-founder of VimpelCom, Banglalink's parent company, sat down with The Daily Star for a joint interview on the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony of the country's first 'IT Incubator'. The IT Incubator was set up by Banglalink at Janata Tower Software Technology Park at Karwan Bazar under a government project that promotes startups in information technology. While Bangladesh is on track to becoming a digital country, it needs to increase the participation of small- and medium-enterprises and startups in economic activities, they said. Even Facebook and Google were start-ups 15-20 years ago. “Now, they have become global tech giants,” Zhao said. “If they can get this much success then why not the developing world's youth? They can also develop the next Facebook or Google from their home.” Though Facebook and Google are big companies, they need support from small and medium companies and the bright youths of Bangladesh can serve them by sitting at home. The Bangladeshi government is very supportive of the SMEs and startups, which is commendable, Zhao added. The ITU secretary general said it is not easy to establish big companies in developing countries. “From ITU we can also present young startups on the global platform and place their success stories so that they can tie up with good partners.” Zhao has visited Bangladesh three times already and every time he saw positive developments. “Bangladeshi people are doing extremely well -- better than our expectations.” Citing the case of 'Infolady', he urged the government to support projects of that kind in order to bring significant changes in society. He also said the Bangladesh government should give more importance to public private partnerships for building digital infrastructure. Banglalink and VimpelCom have plans to groom local youths in cooperation with the ICT ministry to give the sector a boost, Fabela said. More than 20,000 students participated in Banglalink's Grandmaster idea contest, which sought ideas for mobile applications that can change the lives of millions.  In another 'Digital Bangladesh' initiative, over 300,000 students across the country were educated through Banglalink's nationwide internet awareness campaign. “I think the ecosystem is almost ready. If we get spectrum neutrality, service will be easier to get and more people will come on board the digital platform,” he said, adding that 4G service will accelerate the process. The VimpelCom boss said they plan to partner with the local authorities to accelerate the 'Digital Bangladesh' vision. “We believe that offering digital services is the path to the future.” To become a digital service provider, the right skills are a must. “That is why the company will focus on building and attracting the right digital skills to better serve its customers and training its staff to be truly digitally savvy.” Fabela also believes that a digital culture and the right mindset are essential. Employees of Banglalink, the second largest mobile operator after Grameenphone, will be encouraged not to shy away from going into uncharted territories to better serve its customers. Fabela called upon the government to allow the mobile phone operators to offer financial services as well. VimpelCom has operations in 18 other countries and in all of them they offer mobile financial services. “If we get the chance to operate MFS the business processing sector will also flourish,” Fabela said, adding that Banglalink can provide greater security to customers' money and prevent illegal fund transfers. About the proposed merger of Robi-Airtel, he said they are welcoming competition and will keep on doing their best to secure their position in the market. However, he believes the merger will change the landscape of the country's telecom sector. To secure its position, VimpelCom will likely have to make further investments. About the government move to introduce mobile number portability, Fabela welcomed it, saying it will give customers the freedom to choose their desired network. “Banglalink is expecting a good competition as once MNP starts the operators will have to attract customers by their offerings and benefits.” Zhao also appreciated the government's satellite initiative, saying it was a desperately needed equipment to make Bangladesh a digital country. “Though there are some unresolved issues about the satellite orbital slot with Bangladesh and some other countries, ITU can help resolve it within a short time.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

He took over as director after Google X founder Sebastian Thrun left in 2013, and led until Google hired former Hyundai exec John Krafcik as the CEO of its car division. The New York Times reports Urmson was unhappy with the recent direction of the project under Krafcik and had "quarreled" with Larry Page, however his post simply says he's "ready for a fresh challenge." Autonomous driving tech has come a long way since the first time we saw the fruits of Google's labor, and a partnership with Chrysler indicates it has entered a much more practical phase of development. Urmson joined Google after working on self-driving tech at Carnegie Mellon to win DARPA challenges, and watched the project go from a goal of 100,000 miles self-driven to completing 1.8 million miles (with a few accidents, usually caused by human drivers). There's no indication on what's next, but he says "If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky."

Use OpenID Login with Google sphinxcontrib-napoleon 0.5.3 Downloads ↓ Sphinx "napoleon" extension. Latest Version: 0.5.4 Note As of Sphinx 1.3, the napoleon extension will come packaged with Sphinx under sphinx.ext.napoleon. The sphinxcontrib.napoleon extension will continue to work with Sphinx <= 1.2. Are you tired of writing docstrings that look like this: :param path: The path of the file to wrap
:type path: str
:param field_storage: The :class:`FileStorage` instance to wrap
:type field_storage: FileStorage
:param temporary: Whether or not to delete the file when the File
   instance is destructed
:type temporary: bool
:returns: A buffered writable file descriptor
:rtype: BufferedFileStorage
 ReStructuredText is great, but it creates visually dense, hard to read docstrings. Compare the jumble above to the same thing rewritten according to the Google Python Style Guide: Args:
    path (str): The path of the file to wrap
    field_storage (FileStorage): The :class:`FileStorage` instance to wrap
    temporary (bool): Whether or not to delete the file when the File
       instance is destructed

Returns:
    BufferedFileStorage: A buffered writable file descriptor
 Much more legible, no? Napoleon is a Sphinx extension that enables Sphinx to parse both NumPy and Google style docstrings - the style recommended by Khan Academy. Napoleon is a pre-processor that parses NumPy and Google style docstrings and converts them to reStructuredText before Sphinx attempts to parse them. This happens in an intermediate step while Sphinx is processing the documentation, so it doesn’t modify any of the docstrings in your actual source code files. Getting Started Install the napoleon extension: $ pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon
 After setting up Sphinx to build your docs, enable napoleon in the Sphinx conf.py file: # conf.py

# Add autodoc and napoleon to the extensions list
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinxcontrib.napoleon']
 Use sphinx-apidoc to build your API documentation: $ sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source projectdir
 Docstrings Napoleon interprets every docstring that Sphinx autodoc can find, including docstrings on: modules, classes, attributes, methods, functions, and variables. Inside each docstring, specially formatted Sections are parsed and converted to reStructuredText. All standard reStructuredText formatting still works as expected. Docstring Sections All of the following section headers are supported: Args (alias of Parameters) Arguments (alias of Parameters) Attributes Example Examples Keyword Args (alias of Keyword Arguments) Keyword Arguments Methods Note Notes Other Parameters Parameters Return (alias of Returns) Returns Raises References See Also Warning Warnings (alias of Warning) Warns Yield (alias of Yields) Yields Google vs NumPy Napoleon supports two styles of docstrings: Google and NumPy. The main difference between the two styles is that Google uses indention to separate sections, whereas NumPy uses underlines. Google style: def func(arg1, arg2):
    """Summary line.

    Extended description of function.

    Args:
        arg1 (int): Description of arg1
        arg2 (str): Description of arg2

    Returns:
        bool: Description of return value

    """
    return True
 NumPy style: def func(arg1, arg2):
    """Summary line.

    Extended description of function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg1 : int
        Description of arg1
    arg2 : str
        Description of arg2

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Description of return value

    """
    return True
 NumPy style tends to require more vertical space, whereas Google style tends to use more horizontal space. Google style tends to be easier to read for short and simple docstrings, whereas NumPy style tends be easier to read for long and in-depth docstrings. The Khan Academy recommends using Google style. The choice between styles is largely aesthetic, but the two styles should not be mixed. Choose one style for your project and be consistent with it.

Whether your Android phone is close to getting max’d out or giving you the dreaded “low storage space” warning message — you’re going to need to back things up. It’s also important in the event your phone ever goes missing, is stolen, or it’s simply time to upgrade to something new. While there are various apps and services you could use to backup your media to the cloud, without a doubt one of the easiest (and most affordable) is by using Google Photos. Google Photos offers unlimited high-quality photo backups (and videos up to 1080p), making it the perfect solution for offloading all those photos and videos using up your precious internal storage. Since Google Photos comes pre-installed on most Android devices, it should already be in your app drawer under “Photos.” If it’s not already on your device, you can download it from the Google Play Store right here. Back up your camera roll When you first open Photos, you’ll be presented with a chronological timeline of your camera roll — everything that’s both stored on your phone and media that’s been backed up to Photos in the cloud. To enable the backing up of photos and videos from your camera roll, you’ll first need to turn it on. You can do this by following these simple steps: Open the Photos app Open the slide out menu by swiping from the left edge of the screen Tap on Settings Select Back up & sync Tap the Back up & sync switch to turn it on It doesn’t work right away. You’ll first have to wait until you’re connected to WiFi before a backup takes place. There are settings to change this, with the option to start backing up as soon as a photo is taken via a cellular connection (photos or videos) but only recommended if you have an unlimited data plan. You can also set it so that backups only take place while your phone is charging, something that can help conserve battery life and gives you a little time to manage photos before they’re sent to the cloud. Back up other folders on your device Keep in mind that enabling back up & sync will only back up photos & videos taken with your camera app — not all the things you’ve downloaded online or from messaging apps, emails, or social networks. To back those up, you’ll need to select do the following: Select Back up device folders Tap on the names of folders you also want backed up Or… Open the Photos app Open the slide out menu by swiping from the left edge of the screen Tap on Device folders Tap on the cloud icon to back up specific folders Backed up folders will have a blue highlighted cloud icon How do I know if my photos have been backed up? The main Photos section shows you all the photos/videos taken from your camera roll — and the folders you’ve chosen to back up — in perfect chronological order. If you see a photo or video here, it’s already backed up to your account. The exception to this being photos/videos with the circular arrow icon in the bottom right corner. This means these photos/videos are either in the process of being synced, or waiting for the correct connection settings (WiFi, while charging, etc.) before being uploaded. Since these aren’t backed up yet, you may want to wait until the arrows icon disappear before factory resetting your device or deleting them from a separate gallery app. Delete photos/videos from your phone that have already been backed up Although not everyone will want to go this route, for many, the main reason they’re even using Photo is because they’re running out of space on their phone. For those, Google makes it super easy to free up precious internal storage by deleting the media you’ve already been backed up to your account. You just have to enable it. It’s called Free up device storage and can be located in the Photo settings. When selected, Photos will ask you to confirm you’d like to delete your photos & videos that have already been safely backed up to the cloud. Once selected, sit back and wait while Photos does all the work for you. Additional settings, features, and tools Once backed up to Google Photos, all your photos will be stored in the cloud and immediately accessible from all your devices, computers, or other web connected devices. The benefit of having your photos backed up to your Google Photos account means you can easily share these photos, videos, and album collections with others, then collaborate or access them from any internet connected device via the app or website. It’s more than just backup. Google Photos offers a plethora of features and tools to take advantage of. Here are a few: Visual Search – Photos are automatically searchable by the people, places and things in them. Try searching “dog,” “food,” or a specific place to pull up relevant photos. Bring photos to life – Photos will automatically create montage movies, interactive stories, collages, animations, panoramas, and more from your photos. You can also create them yourself by tapping the “+” button. Easy editing – Photos features powerful, easy to use photo editing tools to apply filters or adjust the image however you like. Shared albums – By adding friends or family to a shared album, you can compile all your photos from an event into one single place. Instant sharing – Photos and videos can instantly be shared with anyone by tapping the “Create Link” button and sharing it with whomever you like. Rediscover your photos -The “Assistant” feature in Photos can automatically create collages of your old photos, or help you relive the past by pulling up old ones. Ready to Cast – With Chromecast support, it’s easy to cast all your photos and videos to your TV. And of course… Unlimited free high quality storage – All of your photos and videos are stored safely in the cloud and viewable via the app or on the web at photos.google.com. Free up space on your device – Never worry about your smartphone or tablet running out of storage with the ability to remove media that’s already been backed up. ****** And that’s all there is to it. Photo and video backup shouldn’t be something you have to worry about on Android and Google Photos makes the whole process easy and painless. Should you decide you’d like to save your photos and video in their full, original quality, you also have that option but should definitely consider upgrading your Google Drive Storage first. For the vast majority of folks, Google Photos should fulfill the need to keep all their photos and video backed up safely in the cloud.

It becomes more robust and seamless with each passing decade, providing an astonishing means of superimposing computer-generated images atop a user’s view of reality, thus creating a composite view rooted in both real and virtual worlds. Although AR apps run the gamut, from interactive map overlays and virtual showrooms to massive multiplayer skirmishes, each piece of software hones in on smartphone GPS and camera functionality to create a more immersive experience. Related: Want to master Pokémon Go? Here’s every tip you need to know The available selection of augmented reality apps is diverse, encompassing both premium and freemium offerings from a variety of big and no-name developers, but sometimes choosing which apps are worth your smartphone or tablet’s precious memory is tougher than using the apps themselves. Here are our top picks for the best augmented reality apps available, whether you’re searching for iOS or Android apps. The best AR apps Pokémon GO (free) Pokemon Go (Android/iOS)More It wouldn’t be a list of the best AR apps without mentioning Niantic’s Pokémon Go, a game that has quickly captured everyone’s attention and given them a reason to go out into the world, walk around, and catch Pokémon. The game uses GPS to mark your location, and move your in-game avatar, while your smartphone camera is used to show Pokémon in the real world. For the most part, it works, provided the game hasn’t crashed or frozen. There aren’t a lot of instructions when you first start, or information regarding game mechanics like the colored rings around wild Pokémon, but thanks to the nature of the internet, figuring out what to do isn’t that tough. Players of Ingress, another creation from Niantic, will see many similarities between the developer’s two games, right down to the locations marked as PokéStops and Gyms. The implementation of the original 150 Pocket Monsters is definitely the biggest thing Pokémon Go has, well, going for it compared to its predecessor. Niantic is set to continue updating the game to improve its performance, however, and add new features like trading, so hopefully Pokémon Go will stick around for a good, long while. Download now for: Android iOS Ink Hunter (free) Ink Hunter is the app you should use when deciding on a tattoo and where to put it. The app lets you try out pre-made tattoos, as well as your own designs, and they can be oriented in whatever position you like and placed on any part of the body. Tattoos placed on the body using the camera look as close to real life as you’re going to get — without actually going under the needle that is — and that’s all thanks to the in-app editor and the way Ink Hunter renders tattoos. The app previously only supported black-and-white tattoos, but its latest update added support for color tattoos as well, meaning you can get a better understanding of what the design will look like before you make it permanent. Currently, Ink Hunter is only available on iOS, but there are plans for Android and Windows Phone versions. So, if you’re planning to get a tattoo sometime soon, but don’t have an Apple device, maybe consider holding off on that tattoo for a bit, or borrow a friend’s iPhone or iPad. Read More Download now for: iOS WallaMe (free) WallaMe lets you leave hidden messages in various locations around the world that can only be read by other people using the WallaMe app. When using the app, you can take a picture of a nearby wall, street, or sign, then use the in-app drawing and painting tools to create your own special messages. You can also attach pictures to the areas you’ve chosen, if only to prove you were actually there. The augmented reality really comes into play when you’re in a location that has a hidden message, but it can only be found by using WallaMe and your device’s camera. Messages can be made private, too, so that only friends using the app can see them, or they can be made public for everyone to discover. WallaMe’s biggest strength also works against it, in a way. Those that aren’t aware of the app’s existence, or those that don’t regularly use it, may never see the clever messages created by others. That being said, fans of the app may want to keep it that way, in order to maintain the feel of exclusivity. Download now for: Android iOS Star Chart (free) Star Chart may be an educational app, but it’s a really cool one that’s sure to appeal to people of all ages. When Star Chart is opened on your Android or iOS device and pointed at the sky, the app will inform you of what stars or planets you’re currently facing, even during the day when the stars are at their hardest to see. It does it all in real-time, too, without you having to press a button to initiate it. Functions don’t stop there, either, because the app can even let you know what the night sky looks like on the other side of Earth, as well as show you where in the sky your star sign is located. If that wasn’t enough, there’s a feature called Time Shift, which allows you to move up to 10,000 years forward or backward in time to see where the stars once were or will be located. Download now for: Android iOS Google Translate (free) Google Translate isn’t strictly an AR app, but it does have one AR feature that’s incredibly useful for translating text. That particular feature is part of the app’s camera mode. Simply snap a photo of the text you don’t understand, and the app will translate the text in your photo in real time. When connected to Wi-Fi, the app supports a vast number of languages — 13 of which were added in a recent update — but users can also download a number of language packs if they want to continue using the instant translation feature while offline or without a cellular connection. Next time you take a trip to a country with a language you don’t fluently speak, Google Translate could be your best friend and the very thing that will keep you from getting lost in a strange land. Download now for: Android iOS AR apps for navigation Wikitude World Browser (free) Wikitude World Browser is widely regarded as the king of all augmented reality browsers, and in a way, serves as a third eye of sorts. While using your smartphone’s camera in a given area, the virtual browser — along with more than 3,500 associated content providers — offers you just about any geographically-relevant information you may find valuable in your travels. Useful information is often presented in the form of Wikipedia articles detailing the hallmarks of a specific landmark, or directions to the nearest ATM location or five-star Italian restaurant. Moreover, the app allows users to find hotels and similar accommodations through Yelp, TripAdvisor, and the like, while offering mobile deals and coupons for local stores in the vicinity. The built-in AR games, including the rollicking Alien Attack and bug-beating Swat the Fly, and the app’s ability to mark and share your favorite spots via Facebook are merely an added bonus. Download now for: Android iOS Blackberry Windows Phone Yelp Monocle (free) Yelp Monocle (Android/iOS/Kindle)More Yelp has always been ahead of the curve. The prominent, social reviewing service provided the iPhone with its first augmented reality app in 2009, the Yelp Monocle, well before similar services began cropping up across the board. The convenient app uses your smartphone’s GPS and compass to display AR markers for nearby restaurants, bars, and other businesses in real time, each bundled with the service’s user-generated ratings and reviews. If signed up with a Yelp account, the app additionally provides directions to nearby friends and the businesses they’ve recently checked into, placing the same AR markers as previously mentioned for friends, family, colleagues, and anyone else utilizing the robust service. Monocle, although somewhat a hidden feature within Yelp, is hands down the best utility for finding and following directions to the most well-regarded, or atrocious, businesses in your local vicinity. Download now for: Android iOS Kindle Theodolite ($6) Theodolite (iOS)More Although knowing your exact latitude, longitude, and elevation when trekking through the wilderness is by no means necessary, one can’t help but be curious from time to time. Theodolite is essentially an electronic viewfinder primarily designed for hikers, golfers, hunters, boaters, and other active people, one which turns your tablet or smartphone into an informative lens of topographic information and data overlays. Once downloaded, the app serves a GPS tool, rangefinder, tracker, geo-tag camera, compass, two-axis inclinometer, and a zoom camera, and even has an A-B calculator for measuring distance, height, heading positions, relative angles, and triangulation. It’s a jack of all trades when it comes to surveying the landscape, so much so Apple highlighted Theodolite’s built-in features during one of its iconic keynote addresses in late 2013. Download now for: iOS Spyglass ($4) Spyglass (iOS)More Though the days of conquistadors and fabled explorers are far behind us, there often comes a time when a quality compass can save your neck. Being the case, the iOS-exclusive Spyglass is built from the ground up as a robust navigation toolkit, encompassing a wide swath of noteworthy tools for accurately determining your position and navigating to a set location. Rooted in a tactical GPS technology available in geo and military formats, the app includes both a MilSpec compass and gyrocompass, along with a waypoint tracker, sextant, inclinometer, speedometer, altimeter, and access to street, satellite and hybrid maps. Furthermore, users can track their position via the sun, moon and stars, or use the optical rangefinder to measure the distance to a particular object in real-time. Coupled zoom-camera functionality, a coordinate converter, and an angular calculator top off the features list, rendering Spyglass one of the most industrious iOS apps you purchases for purchase for under $5. Download now for: iOS Augmented Car Finder (free) Augmented Car Finder (iOS)More We’ve all done it before — you finish up your grocery shopping and head out into the parking lot to make your way home, but unfortunately have no idea where you parked. Fortunately, Augmented Car Finder is an app specifically designed to help guide you to your hiding vehicle. Once the car’s location is set, the app creates a visible marker showing the car, the distance you are from it, and the direction you should walk to find it. We’ve found that it’s most useful for places like stadiums, convention centers, outdoor concert venues, and other crowded areas or those lined with massive parking lots. Users can also utilize the app to find their seats in large theaters and concert halls. The freemium version of the software should suffice for most users, but the premium version does remove the ads and include additional tools for marking your favorite parking spot or specifying the arrow color. Augmented Car Finder may be an iOS exclusive, but Android users can always purchase the similarly-equipped Car Finder AR ($2.75). Download now for: iOS AR games and entertaiment Ingress (free) Google Ingress (Android)More Ingress was Google’s first entry into the AR game market, and it’s easily one of the most creative AR applications we’ve ever seen. Basically, the game is an MMO that puts players into two factions — the Enlightened and the Resistance — and has them fight for control of virtual territories in a giant game of king of the hill. Players gain a material called Exotic Matter (XM) by simply walking around, and can use that XM to take over virtual portals. When three or more portals are taken over by either team, they gain control of the area between the portals. It’s a comprehensive strategy title at its core, heavily rooted in science fiction and bolstered by a continuous open narrative, while offering the most social experience of any AR app on our list. Ingress was initially developed by Niantic as an Android exclusive, but you can get it on iOS now, too. Download now for: Android iOS SpecTrek ($3) SpecTrek (Android)More SpecTrek is an AR game that essentially brings Ghostbusters to life on your smartphone — but without all the vacuum cleaners and cheesy lines from Dan Aykroyd. The game populates your surrounding environment with virtual poltergeists and invites you to hunt down and capture them with your phone. Hold the phone flat to display an overhead map of the surrounding area, use your ghost radar to track them down, and then hold it vertically to bring up scanner mode, and capture them with your smartphone’s built-in camera. Additionally, the game offers statistics, awards, titles, records, and other in-game features, and though the coupled animation is nothing to write home about, there are far less enticing ways of killing boredom on a Sunday afternoon than gallivanting around and netting ghosts in the local park. Download now for: Android SnapShot Showroom (free) SnapShot Showroom (iOS)More Retail isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but there will likely come a day when you’ll consider purchasing a decent sofa in lieu of the ratty, college-curated piece of work you call a couch. With SnapShop showroom, users can see what potential furniture may look like in the comfort of their living room, kitchen, bedroom, or any other desired area of their home. Once you capture an image of the room you wish to furnish, you can quickly browse and place assorted items (chairs, lamps, beds, tables, etc.) from the likes of big-name retailers like IKEA, Pier 1 Imports, Crate & Barrel, and Horchow, among others. Users can then resize the furniture, reposition it in the virtual environments, and try various patterns and color combinations until they find the right fit for their home. The furniture can even be purchased directly within the app afterward, conveniently saving you a trip to the store or the accompanying headache that goes hand-in-hand with the discovering you had the wrong dimensions all along. Download now for: iOS Augment (free) Augment (Android/iOS)More Visualizing furniture in it’s potential environment is one thing, but being able visualize nearly any 3D model in augmented reality is something completely different. Although somewhat complex, Augment is an app specially designed to boost sales, bring print to life, and visually see the possibilities at hand. Once users sign up with a free Augment Manager account, the app allows users to upload their own 3D images and trackers from applications such as Cinema 4D, Sketchup, Maya, and the like, and place the 3D models in a virtual environment using the camera on their iOS device. A steep learning curve accompanies some of the more advanced features, but said features also make the software more capable. It handle’s print content in a similar fashion to Layer, offering additional multimedia features with a simple camera scan, but the sheer ability to upload your own 3D content helps it edge out the competition when it comes to deciding where to put that recently-purchased display kiosk or building model. Download now for: Android iOS Quiver (free) Quiver (Android/iOS)More Given smartphones are more tailored for adults than adolescents, the staggering dearth of AR content for children isn’t exactly surprising. Thankfully, Quiver (formerly known as ColAR Mix) works to bring your child’s 2D color books to life with animated images that spring directly from the Crayola-lined pages upon your kitchen table. Although the app requires printed color pages, users can download one of several free coloring packs on the Quiver’s website, each of which encompasses everything from fire-breathing dragons and cuddly teddy bears, to towering dinosaurs and wild stallions. Once drawn, users merely need to ensure the entirety of the page is viewable within their smartphone camera’s peripheral, thus allowing the image to come to life with the drawn details and accompanying music. Users can watch the animations from any angle once started, pause the content, or even zoom in and out as if viewing a real-life object — and despite being geared toward children — there’s no denying it’s a bit of fun for all ages. Download now for: Android iOS Other AR apps Layar (free) Layar (Android/iOS/Blackberry)More Print only goes so far in a world bursting with digital, interactive multimedia. Clad in a baby blue interface and bundled with a commendable help function, the Layar app is designed to bring print content into the digital realm, allowing users to quickly scan and pull data from a variety of commonplace content using their smartphone or tablet. Once a print source has been scanned, the app can retrieve direct shopping links to particular products in a matter of seconds, or bring up videos encapsulating the latest cover shoot for a particular magazine. Furthermore, the app includes tools for sharing retrieved content via the typical social media avenues and touts features akin to the aforementioned Wikitude World Browser, providing a simple means for browsing and setting directions to nearby restaurants, ATMs, historical sites, and other notable places of interest. The ability to scan QR codes, magazines, and other print content may be more of a novelty than anything else, but it does make purchasing that designer tie that much easier. Download now for: Android iOS Blackberry Sun Seeker ($10) Sun Seeker (Android/iOS)More As the name might suggest, Sun Seeker is an app obsessively designed with one thing in mind: the enormous star position in the center of our solar system. The app provides both a flat view compass and a 3D, AR view, each detailing the sun’s solar path, maximum elevation, its hourly intervals, and its rise and set times, among other noteworthy data. Furthermore, the app presents the sun’s winter and summer solstice paths, and allows users to quickly view the sun’s current position in the sky, complete with marked hour points. Though users can choose from nearly any location on earth, the app also taps into your mobile device’s GPS and magnetometer, providing useful information for gardeners, photographer, architects, real estate buyers, and anyone else looking to discover optimal lighting conditions and relative solar angles for a given location. Plus, users can even view the solar path for a chosen date. Needless to say, the Aztecs would be a wee bit envious. Download now for: Android iOS Google SkyMap (free) Google SkyMap (Android)More It’s tough to argue with a mobile app touting nearly half a million recommendations in the Play Store. Google Sky Map will magically instill you with Carl Sagan-like powers and give you the ability to identify everything in the night sky. Once installed, just point your phone upward when it’s reasonably dark and clear outside, and Google will point out all the different stars, constellations, and planets that are visible to your phone’s camera. As you’d expect from Google, the app is super smooth and does all its identifications in real time, and even allows users to search for specific stars and planets not presently visible on your screen. Once found, the on-screen interface and directional compass will then directly guide you to said star or planet — even if hidden behind a veil of cloud cover or obscured by the horizon. Download now for: Android iOnRoad ($1) iOnRoad (Android)More There were more than 34,000 motor vehicle deaths in the United States in 2012. It’s a staggering number, but also one that could be curbed with AR apps like iOnRoad. Using your smartphone’s camera, the simple apps strives to help prevent collisions while providing robust navigation once situated on your car windshield or dash. The app automatically starts when your vehicle begins moving and saves your parking location once stopped, while additionally alerting you when you’re speeding, warning you when you’re crossing a solid marking line, and taking snapshots of drivers that dangerously cut you off while switching lanes. Moreover, the app offers statistics covering gas consumption, routes, safety, velocity, and acceleration, providing users with a general overview of their driving habits. Plus, who doesn’t like an integrated music player and quick access to their favorite contacts? Download now for: Android SpotCrime (free) SpotCrime (Android/iOS)More Sometimes obliviousness is a terrific thing, but that’s rarely the case when it comes to safety. With SpotCrime, users can gather a wealth of real-time crime information and alerts for nearly any location in the United States, United Kingdom, and selected parts of Canada. SpotCrime pinpoints your location via your smartphone’s GPS, pulling crime data from police departments, sheriff agencies, news media, and other sources. Crimes range from robberies and shootings to arrests and assaults, and the app pinpoints each occurrence with its respective icon on a map. Moreover, users can set up automated alerts and search for crimes surrounding a specific address or view them as a list accompanied with links to additional information. The app may not prevent crimes, but it will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the more dangerous avenues and times to be out and about in your neighborhood or park block. As the official SpotCrime description says, “don’t let anyone take your mojo.” Download now for: Android iOS Best app deals of the day! 6 paid iPhone apps for free for a limited time Best app deals of the day! 6 paid iPhone apps for free for a limited time 100 awesome iPhone apps for 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz The best Black Friday tech deals Yahoo Finance Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Alphabet Inc’s Google had named Urmson chief technical officer of the project after it hired former Hyundai Motor Co executive John Krafcik to be chief executive of the project. Urmson, who joined the project when it was launched and has been a public face of Google’s autonomous vehicle efforts, in March testified before a US Senate panel on autonomous cars. Krafcik confirmed Urmson’s departure on Friday afternoon on Twitter. Urmson, in a blog post late on Friday, said he was “ready for a fresh challenge.” He said he was not sure what he would do next. “Going to take some time and get some perspective from outside of Google,” he wrote in a text message to reporters. ‘INEVITABLE TECH’ Urmson told reporters earlier this year that self-driving cars are coming. “I’ve gone from hoping this would happen to thinking it might happen to knowing it will happen,” Urmson said. Google self-driving car project spokesman Johnny Luu confirmed Urmson’s departure and praised him. “Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this life-saving technology will soon become a reality,” Luu said. Google’s project has had other significant departures, even as it has hired dozens of new employees. OTHER DEPARTURES Earlier this year, Anthony Levandowski, who was product manager for Google’s self-driving car program, left the project to cofound a start-up with two other former Google employees. The project is expected to become a standalone company this year. Last month, it appointed its first general counsel. Google has logged more than 2.9 million kilometers of autonomous driving in testing in Texas, California, Arizona and Washington states. It has said it has no timetable for making self-driving vehicles available to the public. Officials have said Google is preparing to make its self-driving car unit a separate company. The program is now part of its X research laboratory unit. “The self-driving car project is in the middle of graduating from X and this is sort of a gradual process,” Astro Teller, who heads the X program, told NBC News in April. In May, Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said they had agreed to work together to build a fleet of nearly 100 self-driving minivans, the first time a Silicon Valley firm had teamed up with a traditional automaker to develop an autonomous vehicle. In March, reports said that Google’s self-driving car team was expanding and hiring more people with automotive industry expertise, underscoring the company’s determination to move the division past the experimental stage.

(View our Privacy Policy) With world as its playground, Pokémon Go pushes legal, ethical bounds Tony Marrero, Times Staff Writer Link View all Articles TONY MARREROTampa Bay Times Saturday, August 6, 2016 11:03am Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Pokemon Go players are glued to their phones as they walk the shore at Ballast Point Park. The city of Tampa is still waiting for a reply to its request that the maker of the game cut back on the virtual creatures that draw players to the park. [ZACK WITTMAN | Times] TAMPA — They've descended on cemeteries, veterans memorials and the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. Related News/Archive 'Pokémon Go' app catches attention of gamers across the world — and Tampa Bay 4 Months Ago What's troubling athletes arriving in Rio? No Pokémon Go 4 Months Ago Tampa asks Pokémon GO creator to remove PokéStops from Ballast Point Park 4 Months Ago In their zeal to catch digital creatures that pop up on their smartphone screens, Pokémon Go players are flocking to places where they're not always welcome. Niantic, the game's developer, is fielding requests from exasperated property owners who want the company to remove virtual markers that draw crowds to real-world places. The city of Tampa, for example, has asked the company to take the "PokéStops" out of Ballast Point Park ( tbtim.es/14ru) because so many players are showing up when the park is closed. The friction raises questions about the technology that makes the augmented reality game possible. How much responsibility does Niantic bear for the actions of people using its product? And what obligation, if any, does the company have to respond to requests like Tampa's? Experts say the company may have the law on its side, at least for now, but the popularity of Pokémon Go has pushed Niantic into uncharted legal and ethical waters. "The question is, how far does a third party like Niantic have to go before it becomes responsible for encouraging players to trespass or create a nuisance," said Brian Wassom, a media attorney and author of Augmented Reality Law, Privacy, and Ethics. "That's an untested legal question." ••• You might not care about the difference between a Charmander and a Jigglypuff, but to understand why players are mobbing a waterfront park in tony South Tampa, you need a primer on Pokémon Go. The goal of the game, which is based on the original Nintendo game of the 1990s and downloaded as a mobile app, is to capture Pokémon creatures that pop up on the screen. The game uses the phone's camera so the characters appear to surface in the real world. In map view, the player's avatar, Pokémon characters and game markers appear on a digital map. At PokéStops, players can replenish their avatar's supplies and drop "lures" that cause Pokémon creatures to appear. At PokéGyms, players pit their captured critters against each other in on-screen battles. The app uses the phone's GPS function with Niantic's proprietary mapping software. Niantic developed the software for its first augmented reality game, Ingress, which launched in 2011. That game didn't catch on like Pokémon Go. "The technology has been around for several years, but it's been the enthusiasts using it, not the masses," said Mark Skwarek, director of New York University's Augmented Reality Lab. Skwarek has worked on augmented reality for more than a decade and has worked on GPS-based games like Pokémon Go. Niantic was formed in 2010 by John Hanke as Niantic Labs, an internal startup within the Internet and technology giant Google, before it was spun out as an independent entity last fall. Hanke was one of the founders of Keyhole, the company Google bought to start Google Earth. Hanke was involved with Google Maps before forming Niantic. As it developed Ingress, Niantic built a huge database of real-world landmarks that later became the starting point for Pokémon Go, according to the technology magazine Mashable. The company uses another set of data based on geographic markers, such as bodies of water, to decide where certain Pokémon characters will appear. After the game launched in the United States last month, word spread quickly on social media that Ballast Point Park was one of the best places in the area to play. The 7.5-acre park has several PokéStops — players have reported as many as nine — and at least one PokéGym. But the attraction transcends the plentiful Pokémon. Players say rare characters that can't be found anywhere else in the city appear regularly at Ballast Point. This has proved an irresistible draw for players who disregard the sign noting the park is open only from dawn to dusk. Neighbors call to complain and police show up to disperse crowds that reached 150 one night last month. Public parks, with their easy access and open spaces, are a natural playground for augmented reality games, Skwarek said. So Niantic puts an extra focus on parks, dropping virtual goodies there to draw players. "They see these as places to really hype up the game," he said. But how do places less appropriate for game playing, like the National Holocaust Museum and cemeteries, wind up with PokéStops? An algorithm that automatically pulled landmarks from maps is probably to blame, Skwarek said. Niantic can easily intervene to make manual changes, he said. It's usually as simple as highlighting the features on a digital map and clicking "delete" or removing the coordinates from a spreadsheet. Niantic has an electronic form on its website for property owners who want the company to remove stops and gyms. The company declined to answer emailed questions from the Times about what criteria the company uses to evaluate the requests and how long it takes to respond. Instead, a spokesman referred a reporter to a previously issued statement that Niantic is "moving quickly to review all such requests." Published reports show the forms are being submitted from all over the world. Niantic honored a request from the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. In a Web post last week, officials in Provo, Utah, said they were surprised at how quickly the company granted their request to remove stops from the public library. But a cathedral in Germany has threatened legal action because the company has not responded to its requests. Tampa officials have said they don't want people to stop playing the game at Ballast Point Park, but made the request to Niantic as a "proactive" way to try to make the park less of draw and reduce crowds. As of Friday, the problems there hadn't abated and the city was still waiting for a response, police spokesman Steve Hegarty said. ••• There is no law against placing virtual markers in a physical space, even private property, said Wassom, the attorney. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that online expression is a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. "If someone were placing physical signs saying, 'Come here and play,' that would be a pretty clear violation of property rights," he said. "But when you're putting virtual markers on a digital map, you're engaging in speech, and that's protected." But just as there limitations on free speech, the right to place virtual markers is not absolute, Wassom said. He said there will be some instances where a virtual marker is viewed as a "clear and present danger," similar to yelling fire in a crowed theater, but in most cases, that's going to be "an awfully uphill battle to fight," he said. "Whenever you're talking about physical trespassing, the responsibility is always going to be on the person committing the act," he said, noting that the Pokémon Go app tells players not to trespass or enter dangerous areas. A New Jersey man fed up with players coming onto his property filed a class action lawsuit against Niantic last week that claims the game entices people to trespass. More lawsuits are sure to follow, and while they won't set binding precedent, they'll be watched very closely, Wassom said. Some cities already are considering new laws and at least one has passed. The City Council in Newnan, Ga., adopted an ordinance July 21 — just two weeks after the game launched — prohibiting people from playing Internet or cellphone games in the city's three cemeteries. Wassom expects similar ordinances to follow. Some will be well thought out but many will face court challenges, he said. Legal or not, companies like Niantic have a duty to be good corporate citizens, said Dan Verreault, director of the Center for Ethics in the University of Tampa's Sykes School of Business. "The company has to be responsible and careful in the design, and responsive and accepting of feedback from affected communities," Verreault said. "I also think at least 50 percent of the responsibility has to be taken by the user who knows that catching a little dinosaur doesn't justify trespassing or disturbing what ought not be disturbed." For cases like Ballast Point Park, Niantic could craft a compromise, such as adjusting the game so its features better align with park hours, said NYU's Skwarek. He said the popularity of the game probably caught the company by surprise and it's probably adding staff to make these kinds of changes. "You have to work with the public on these issues," Skwarek said, "or it's going to backfire when something bad happens." Times senior news researcher John Martin contributed to this report.

The race is on against rivals such as Google, Amazon or Facebook, but Apple lately bought itself some aces to keep up its sleeve.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple puts the pedal to the metal to take over its rivals from Google, Amazon and Facebook in machine learning capabilities, and for that it recently purchased Turi, an AI startup from Seattle. Turi's technologies should help Apple boost its advances in pervasive computing capabilities. For those who skipped that lesson, pervasive computing allows a software (such as a virtual assistant) to make appropriate suggestions to a user on whatever topic they may ask about. For example, the suggestions that appear when a movie, music video or article ends could get better via pervasive computing. To broaden its resource pool, Apple bought AI startup Turi in a transaction rumored to be around $200 million. Turi has impressive expertise in developing and managing various software that tap into a very specific type of Artificial Intelligence, dubbed machine learning. Machine learning is also able to generate better recommendations and crunch customer data to determine or pinpoint accuracy user patterns. All these will come in handy for Apple, which is allegedly going to implement Turi's tricks into its virtual assistant, Siri. When asked about the perspectives of integrating Turi with Siri, Apple chose discretion. In a statement, the company notes that it is common for it to purchase small-scale technology companies and underlines in that discussion that the purpose and plans of the acquisitions fall outside of Apple's modus operandi. Apple scored a consistent list of recent purchases, and Business Insider points out that most of them seem to be AI oriented. Noteworthy buyouts are counting names such as VocalIQ, Perceptio, Emotient and Faceshift, with the first two sharing some of Turi's traits. VocalIQ made use of machine learning to help voice assistants respond in a highly realistic fashion to inquiries. Perceptio, on the other hand, aided the internal processes of AI by sharing bits of personal user data from the respective systems. These two should be important pillars to improve upcoming versions of Siri, insiders familiar with the matter point out. On the visual side of the spectrum, Emotient and Faceshift were startups that specialized in enhancing the capabilities of AI to recognize facial expressions. Apple's helm, Tim Cook, stated that his company's AI focus went toward building features that would "enhance the customer experience." The CEO went on to add that the company plans to deploy machine learning in a variety of products and services.

 Meet Kripa Krishnan, Google's queen of chaos Julie Bort Aug. 6, 2016, 10:01 AM 29,175 facebook linkedin twitter email print Kripa Krishnan, director of Google's Cloud Product Operations & SRE Breakfix/DiRT team. Business Insider/Julie Bort If aliens were to invade earth, or an earthquake lopped California into the ocean, Google wants you to know that it will still be there for you. That's because a group of 10 Google engineers go around purposely breaking things at the company, under the most dire circumstances they can imagine, just to see what happens. Through this process, the team makes sure that Google can keep itself running no matter what happens. Sometimes this team makes Martians invade the earth. Sometimes they feign an earthquake or ecological disaster. They strike their internal Google targets without warning. This is Google’s renowned DiRT team, (Disaster Recovery Testing), led by director Kripa Krishnan, who has perfected the art of breaking Google over the past nine years. Angry, tense, and caffeinated Despite the humor-inspired scenarios she inflicts on her coworkers, the tests themselves are very, very serious, she tells us. Google's director of the DiRT program, Kripa Krishnan. Business Insider/Julie Bort For one thing, the team is taking down actual, live systems, sometimes whole data centers. And if they bork things up too badly for too long and cause Google to have a serious outage, there will be money lost and hell to pay. Before each test, people gather in various "war rooms," sometimes located all over the world, Krishnan tells Business Insider. "We have intense situations in the war room. There’s like 20-30 people sitting there. The room is warm. Everyone is very, very high on caffeine, ready to go and everybody’s angry all the time," laughs Krishnan who, during this interview, is the opposite of tense or angry in every way. She's cheerful. She's cracking jokes. She telling us funny stories of how her small band roams Google, wreaking havoc, with the help of hundreds of other Google experts who are called upon to work on the tests as needed. But, if things go wrong, which they often do (because making things go wrong is the whole point), the stress in the war room really heats up, she says with a smile. For instance, in the middle of one massively orchestrated test on the network that could have taken down a big chunk of Google, the team noticed that a popular app used by millions of people was slowing down. They didn't think their test would cause that. But they didn't know for sure and they wondered if they should abort the test, which would also be dangerous at that particular moment, she recalls. Within 15 minutes they determined their test was not the problem. "But for those 15 minutes, we were just yipping at each other. Shouting, tears in the war room," she recalls. Googler's don't phone home A funnier situation involved the incident-command team trying to communicate with each other. They were planning a scenario where the internet was down, making things like chat rooms or Google Hangouts unavailable. So the plan was that everyone would just go retro and dial into an old-fashioned telephone bridge. Everett Collection/Shutterstock Only it turns out Googlers "don't like phones," she said. People couldn't find the bridge phone number, and they didn't know basic things like how to dial a phone to get an outside line. Worst of all, once they all did get on the line, some folks would put the phone on hold, forcing the rest of the team to stop talking and listen to hold music. "We didn't know how to work the bridge to boot those people out," she laughs. Ditto for satellite phones. Years ago, Google bought its top engineers and execs satellite phones so they could always be reached in case of a disaster. When the DiRT team tested that idea with a fake earthquake, 100% of the people with satellite phones failed to use them. They couldn't find the phones, or they weren't charged, or the only way to get a satellite signal was to "climb onto the roof," and "that's not a safe thing to do" especially after an earthquake, she said. "If we hadn't tested this, we would never have known. We would have kept investing in satellite phones," she says. Beg, borrow, and credit card Google One time, Krishnan and team put a data center to the test by telling the data-center team that a flood had forced the data center off the grid and onto a backup generator running on diesel fuel. They were instructed to purchase a massive quantity of fuel. She was trying to get them to activate Google's procedure to release emergency funds. Instead, no matter what the DiRT team threw at them, (a bigger flood, a fire in another room), the engineers came up with "creative solutions to find money." The engineers asked their local community to donate stuff or to loan them stuff, fees to be paid later. Someone even offered the use of a credit card with an enormously huge credit line to pay for things. They never called the person that would send them the emergency-fund money. But they never let the Google site go down, either.  "They take it seriously, this role-playing stuff," she says. Another time, the team tested the HR department. The scenario was that a meteor had crashed into earth, stranding employees all over the world. "The whole point of it was to completely bombard the HR department," Krishnan says, particularly with questions they wouldn't know, such as approval for expensing a $15,000 flight home, or for buying clothes due to lost luggage. The HR team "shocked" the DiRT team by quickly organizing itself and handling the onslaught very well, she says. Next up: automated 'chaos engineering' Google isn't the only giant internet company in the Valley that needs to make sure it never goes down. Google's director of the DiRT team, Kripa Krishnan. Business Insider/Julie Bort So a small team of testers from other big companies have started to work together to share best practices. They call their young discipline "chaos engineering," Krishnan says. These folks are currently working on ways to automate some of the tests. "Right now, scale is our problem. We are doing hundreds of tests, but I cannot scale my team to hundreds of people. So we are exploring automating some of this. How do you constantly cause damage so systems are constantly recovering?" That kind of thing has never been done before, but after nearly 10 years, she's used to that. All the years of testing has taught Krishnan one important thing: It's not enough to have disaster plans and backup technology in place. People must test, change, and perfect them. "We want people to practice enough so they get the right concepts. And then we trust them to wing it. Give them a lot of space for solving the problem," she says.

But how much of the program do you actually use? Those who just type in an address and go should know that there’s so much more you can do than just that. To help you make the most of that last, great summer road trip, we’ve compiled a list of tips to get more out of Google Maps. Here are some useful features hiding just below the surface. • Multistop trips: Trips aren’t always about going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes there’s a C, D, E or even F you have to get to as well. Google recently started rolling out a new feature that lets you plug in more than one destination at a time. Users can access this by hitting the options menu from the directions screen — you get there by hitting the three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner — and selecting “Add stop.” Keep in mind that you may not see this update yet. • Use “explore”: The “Explore” section of Maps is pretty easy to find, but is probably overlooked by those focused on just getting directions. The feature is particularly useful if you’re traveling on business or to a new place and need to grab a quick bite to eat, and don’t have time to wander around aimlessly. From the main search screen, click on the three parallel lines on the left-hand side of the search bar. (Designers call this common icon the “hamburger.”) If you’re zoomed into a reasonably local area, you should see the “Explore” section, which will direct you to good places to eat, cheap places to eat, nearby attractions and more. • Download an offline area: If you’re going to be somewhere where you can’t get cell service, take advantage of the ability to download a section of Google Maps to access offline. To do this tap in the search bar and scroll down until you see “Download a new offline area.” Alternatively, you can search for a city and swipe up from the bottom, and then hit the “Download” option. Google won’t let you download too large of an area — but you can go up to 120,000 square kilometers. You can interact with this offline section of the map and search for directions to locations within that part of the world. Maps won’t suggest places for you, but it will still be more useful than an old-school map. You should know that if you download a part of Google Maps, it will take up storage space on your phone. But it can be convenient, and it’s way easier to transport than a paper map that you’ll never be able to refold again. • Share directions: Need to let someone else know how to get to where they’re going? Once you have the directions you need, hit the three-dot options menu and tap “Share Directions.” That will let you text or email directions to someone through a link, or even share directions over Twitter or Facebook if you so desire. That’s way easier than reading your phone’s screen to someone, or trying to remember off the top of your head. Besides, your friends are probably just going to put the destination in Google Maps anyway. This feature can save both of you the trouble. • Sign-in for better service: If you’re signed in to Maps it adds quite a bit of functionality– though you’re also giving Google’s app more access to your information. Deciding whether the trade-off is worth it is up to you. If you sign in and turn on your history, from that point you’ll be able to reference your past destinations more quickly. So, if you get a restaurant recommendation for a summer trip and then want to go back the following summer, you should be able to do that quickly. Another advantage to signing in is that you can link your Google Contacts to Google Maps, so it’s easy to find your friend Jim’s house by pulling it from your address book. That saves you from having to ask “Where am I going, again?” when you get in the car. You can sign in to your Google Account by hitting the hamburger icon and tapping “Sign in.” • Know more about what you’re getting into: There are also some settings that most users know about but likely don’t use that often. On the options menu, for example, you can turn on different filters and features to get different information about where you’re headed. If you’re walking in a hilly city such as San Francisco, for example, you may really want to see the terrain around you. A coffee shop may look like it’s just a quick walk and a few blocks away — but those blocks may take you straight up a steep hill. That’s vital information to know if you don’t want to be out of breath by the time you get there. One setting I use a lot that many may find useful is the setting preference to “avoid tolls.” Of course, you can’t always find a toll-free way to get somewhere in the time you need, but it’s still nice to have the option on hand.

Follow TechnoBuffalo There was a time when someone had to come to your house to rob you, or find you on a sidestreet when no one was looking. Now, someone can steal your money, your identity, and more, all from the safety of an anonymized connection anywhere in the world. Rules for online security that worked a few years ago simply do not work anymore, though, and staying with the times is important. I’m going to walk you through some important, easy — if occasionally super annoying — steps to take control of your personal security online. We’ll walk through some caveats, things you and I have no control over, then head into how to make a good password, how to keep track of your passwords, and how to make your accounts more secure when possible with things like Two-Factor Authentication. Everything can be hacked Let’s say you have a bike, and you don’t want to see it stolen. There are a number of measures you can take. You could leave it laying against a tree outside your house. You could wrap a cheap chain around it. You could get a Kryptonite U-lock. The thing is, someone can always steal it. It’s just a matter of how badly they want it. They could just steal the whole bike rack. They could use a jackhammer to pull the rack out of the concrete it’s embedded in. The only way to not have your bike stolen is to not have a bike. The same goes for houses, cars, and passwords. But just like you need a place to live, it’s all but impossible to avoid getting online to some degree. It’s never the victim’s fault for being victimized, but you can protect yourself. Every measure you can take can theoretically be hacked, but the more difficult you make it, the less likely such a scenario is. Just because something isn’t perfect doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing. When, not if The frequency with which sites are hacked and password databases are leaked these days means that it’s not a matter of if one of your passwords is exposed, it’s a matter of when. That inevitability makes all of this much more important. You can only secure yourself That’s good life advice, but it’s pertinent here, too. Some sites use inexcusably terrible security. Sometimes those sites are ones you want to use or, worse, can’t avoid using. Those sites are all the more reason to improve and increase your personal security. You can only make yourself safer – you can’t force some random site or your employer or whoever else to switch away from less secure encryption. In summation: everything can and will be hacked, and half the world is using outdated security. Alright, let’s all set our passwords to password1 and just await the coming apocalypse. Or maybe we can do something about it. Use strong passwords Using strong passwords is the first and most important step to this. While some experts believe we might live in a passwordless future sometime soon, password and security expert Mark Burnett disagrees. “Passwords will never go away,” he told me via email. “We will always need that secret that only we know. But what will change is our dependence on passwords as our only defense.” The thing is, what made a strong password a few years ago doesn’t work anymore. It used to be “hard to guess, easy to remember.” The problem is, nobody guesses passwords anymore. Instead, they’re stolen en masse, leaked, and then compiled into huge password dictionaries to be used by those who want to rip you off. In the video below, which our own Joey Davidson picked up on recently, computer scientist Dr. Mike Pound demonstrates in great (if somewhat meandering) detail how this all works. Nobody sits at a terminal trying to guess your password. When you create a password, the server you’re storing it on — if it was put together by anyone remotely competent — runs the password you’ve put in through an algorithm that generates a complex string of characters to represent that password. Typing in “password” might end up as “$1$O3JMY.Tw$AdLnLjQ/5jXF9.MTp3gHv/” on the server. The hash is easy to create, but difficult to reverse. It’ll also do what’s called adding salt to the password. The same way you add salt to your eggs to spice them up, site add something extra — a randomly generated or secret string — to passwords to make sure they’re not the same as what you’d see in a list of passwords. A randomly generated salt also means that when two people use the same password, their entries in the database aren’t the same. Salting and hashing passwords not only sounds delicious, but it makes them more secure as well. When a company says they don’t store your passwords, they’re telling the truth. They store this scrambled data string instead. When you submit your password, it re-generates it and checks to see if those scrambled strings match up; your original password is never stored anywhere. If a server is compromised and a database of hashed passwords is leaked, a hacker will then run what’s called a dictionary attack on these hashes – there are other attacks as well, but this is a common, easy, and powerful one. In a dictionary attack, the tool the hacker is using generates passwords using a dictionary of known passwords, generates the matching hash, and compares it to yours. If they match, then they’ve figured out your password. A computer outfitted with an off-the-shelf graphics card can perform billions of such comparisons per second. The shorter and less complex the password, the easier the dictionary attack is and the less time it takes to find a match. As Pound demonstrates in his video, shorter passwords can be cracked in seconds. if not microseconds. A common piece of password advice is, “Don’t use any personal information in a password.” Even in this day and age, it’s still good advice — not just because it makes your password harder to guess, but because it helps keep your (cracked) password from appearing in a dictionary. And once a password appears in a dictionary, it’s fair game for an automated dictionary attack, and thus less useful. If your password is MinnesotaTwins1991, it’ll pop up in a dictionary at some point, as the above video demonstrates. Even if, at 17 characters, it’s a pretty long password, it’s made of exactly the sort of passwords that pop up in these databases. So, how do you make a good password? This is where things get kind of miserable, but stick with me and we’ll get to some great tools that make the process nearly painless. Don’t reuse passwords. “Using easy-to-crack passwords and then re-using those week passwords on all of their accounts” is one of the most common ways people leave their accounts exposed online, according to LastPass vice president Joe Siegrist. “It’s all too easy for your one password to fall into the wrong hands.” If you use unique passwords for each account and one is compromised, you only have to reset one password – not 10 or, worse, 45. Use lower case, upper case, numbers, and, if possible, special characters. Not all sites allow all of these, but the more, the better. Make your password as long as the site in question will allow. If you’re using randomized passwords, a 64 character random password would take long enough to break that it might as well be uncrackable. It won’t appear in dictionaries, and is all but impossible to brute force. Seigrist recommended at least 20 characters when we spoke via e-mail. Don’t use l33t sp34k. Dictionary attacks know how to compensate for that. The increased character space is good, but it doesn’t do as much to make it more secure as you might hope. Use randomly generated passwords. The chances they’ll appear in dictionaries is low and gets lower with more characters. Don’t use words found in the dictionary if you can avoid it. Just one, but it’s a good one If you’re taking full advantage of the password managers we’ll get into below, you’ve set all your passwords to long, random, and nigh uncrackable strings, each different from the last. You now have just one password to rule them all. It needs to be a good one, and it needs to be memorable, so the long random string is out of the question. Two great starting points are Randall Munroe’s comic XKCD and his take on the subject, and the follow-up video from Dr. Mike Pound about building good passwords. All the rules from above apply to this, but building a memorable password that is also secure requires us to bend those rules a bit. The password still has to be long, and it still has to be tough to break with a dictionary attack. A phrase made up of multiple words is a good starting point. If you make sure to get a number, some randomly placed punctuation, and an uncommon word in there, you end up with a password that’s easy to remember, easy to type, but still secure. Password managers generally allow as many characters as you can think of for their password schemes, so you can go wild and come up with a unique sentence. 2 Honey badgers f%ught over the zebra’s hat. Otters pro_bably like cotton candy. I’m not kidding; get as weird as you possibly can. Use words from other languages or words you made up as a kid. Anything that has meaning to you that doesn’t have meaning to anyone else can help! Use Two-Factor Authentication whenever possible The philosophy for best passwords right now is that they should consist of “something you know, and something you have.” That’s called Two-Factor Authentication, or 2FA for short, also called multi-factor authentication by some. This is where that lessening dependence Burnett mentioned comes in; he said that authentication “utilizing mobile devices, fingerprints, and one-time codes will greatly minimize the problems of weak passwords.” You can see big sites like Google strongly suggesting options like these to users, with the most common option for 2FA being a text message. At login, Google sends you a text message with a short number that you’ll punch in in response to prove that you’re you. These options, again, aren’t perfect. In that nightmare scenario where you’re in an episode of Mr. Robot and someone is targeting you – yes, you – and they’ve stolen your cellphone or something like that, they they have the ‘something you have.’ But in real world scenarios, 2FA massively increases security for the vast majority of scenarios. In fact, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is beginning to recommend that SMS-based 2FA be phased out in favor of push authentication, cryptographic authentication, and biometrics. If your bank’s password database leaked, the 2FA you turned on will ensure that you retain access to your account until you can get in and change that password (and any other duplicates you hopefully had already gotten rid of by this point). It also means that you get a notification when someone tries to access your account, so you can take action proactively. 2FA is getting better and more common all the time, too. Microsoft, Google, and others use push notifications that allow you to simply click Yes on your cellphone instead of having to read and punch in a six digit number that’s going to time out in 10 seconds. And if you don’t like text messages, many sites have Authenticator servers. Using a mobile app like Authy or Duo, you simply open the application, punch in the PIN you set (this is optional, but recommended), and click on the icon for Amazon or Google. You’ll get the six digit number which you can then even copy and paste into the other app. The phone itself provides another layer of security, too. Even if someone stole your phone, they’d have to get past your lock screen security, like a fingerprint or pattern, and then figure out your pin. At this point, they’re going to realize they have juicier targets to go after. Unless you’re at the center of some vast, international conspiracy or something. But then, you’re probably two steps ahead of all this anyway in that case. Similarly, Google and some other sites allow you to use one or more USB keys as a way to authenticate, removing the need for a phone and the required cellular connection entirely. If you prefer an even more analog option, you can even print out a set of one-time-use codes to store in your wallet. As a matter of personal preference, I use the option offered by apps like Authy that allows me to generate a number when I’m ready rather than having to wait for it, but even with the delay of waiting on a text, the extra security is worth it – especially on sites that store information like your home address and credit card number. Siegrist, who recommended the LastPass Authenticator, said that 2FA is “something most people have heard of, but not enough of us are actually using.” Simply activating it puts you a huge leap above everyone else. Your mother’s maiden name and the street you grew up on Another way to protect yourself is to put false info into a site’s security question fields. Those password managers will get into in a moment can store these false answers easily, and they’re much harder to pull up through social media. It’s unlikely that you’ll be individually targeted, but as outlined by security expert Brian Krebs last year, any “static identifiers” on your account are potential in-roads for further access. Static identifiers are pieces of information about you that won’t change or don’t change easily; your social security number, your date of birth, and your address are three such identifiers. While many companies depend on those static identifiers for account recovery, you don’t need to give them any more than the ones they already use. We can manage all these passwords The toughest part of converting from using passwords you know to randomized passwords is that, unless you’re Rain Man, these are not passwords you remember. Instead, a password manager becomes necessary. Before we talk about password managers, I want to hit on one of the big arguments often presented against password management software. In essence, you’re keeping your passwords all in one place. If someone got that password, they’d have all of them! And, indeed, if someone were targeting you in particular, that’s possible. But the vast majority of password compromises are not targeted attacks, where someone goes after you specifically. Rather, they’re attacks of opportunity – the leaked databases we talked about above. The benefit though, as noted above, is that you can use different passwords for every site without developing chronic headaches. If one site is compromised, only one password has to be changed. While there is the theoretical weakness of having your passwords all stored in one place, the strength of unique, strong passwords is going to apply far more frequently and protect you in far more situations. There are other benefits, too. Some managers let you store your database online, and you can even incorporate things like photos of your insurance cards and ID for reference later. Many offer two factor authentication to access the database. Automatic password capturing, syncing, and updating are frequent features as well, and many have mobile apps. There are too many to go over in detail here, and different users will have different needs. KeePass is free, open source, and offline. Services like LastPass have free options as well, but operate out of online databases and browser extensions. They have more user-friendly autofill functions than KeePass, and are even able to do things like automatically log into sites and update passwords for you – depending on the site. LastPass is free to use, and the yearly subscription gives you access to the mobile app, and it’s only $12 a year. Options like DashLane, 1Password, and RoboForm each have their own slightly different feature sets as well, and are worth checking out in your quest for the right option. There’s a tradeoff with using a service like LastPass, as opposed to a standalone program like KeePass. If you use a service, you’re entirely at the mercy of that service. (What happens if they get sold?) It’s also something of a black box, in that you don’t really know how your data is protected. An open source application like KeePass is beholden to no one, and it’s possible to know the way it stores and protects data by auditing the source code. No matter which manager you use, it should be something that is getting tested by other people. True security requires people testing the security. KeePass allows public auditing of its code through open source licensing, and LastPass has been transparent and proactive about inevitable security issues that have come up. One feature that helped push me toward LastPass was their Security Challenge feature, which shows you how many re-used passwords you have, how often you’re reusing them, and how weak or strong they are. While Seigrist wasn’t able to provide specifics about how the feature has improved security for his userbase, he highlighted exactly what I love about it: “You get the satisfaction of seeing your [Security Challenge] score climb toward 100.” I’m a gamer, and the score and ranking definitely triggered my desire to improve. For most people, the convenience of a service is going to far outweigh the potential problems of relying on one. Be careful with shady browsing and clicking I’m not going to ask you where you go or why, and I’m not going to judge you, but sometimes you want to go looking for something that brings you to the shadier side of the internet, where ads go from simply annoying to actively dangerous. This is where “everything can be hacked” comes back into play. When electronic security methods prove tight enough, social engineering is the next step for hackers, such as getting you to click on tempting or confusing links. If you pick up a trojan because someone promised you a free Starbucks giftcard, or you clicked on those pictures from your brother (that weren’t pictures, and weren’t from your brother), and get infected, then all the strong passwords and 2FA in the world won’t help you. Those who create these targeted attacks are getting better and better at making their emails look real, and something that triggers an emotional response, like an email from your kid’s school’s principal is going to have many people clicking before they think about it. Be suspicious and be careful. For many of us, this is common sense, but it bears repeating because it’s easy to get lazy. If you aren’t 100% sure you can stay away from the shady places, get an antivirus suite. Many of them have gotten much better over the years. Consider using an email solution like Gmail instead of a self-hosted solution, as they’ll tend to do a better job of filtering out phishing emails which are getting frighteningly good in some cases and malicious attachments. For every email from a Nigerian Prince, there’s one that looks almost exactly like an email from your bank. Another trick that is helpful is to use the “private browsing” mode on your browser. Everything that takes place within a private browsing session is discarded when you close that browser. This reduces the chances of anything from one of those sessions being put into the browser’s persistent storage, and thus gives attackers that much less information about your behavior that can be used against you. If you need to supply an email address for a site that you’re not confident about, use a throwaway address. It’s easier than ever to get one now. Services like ThrowAwayMail.com provide this at no or little cost. In general, don’t give information when you’re asked for it – go put it in yourself. Log into your bank site via your usual bookmark instead of clicking on the link that was sent to you. With these tools at hand, and a bit of grunt work getting your passwords in line, you’ll end up far more secure than when you started. If you’re already taking these steps, what password managers and authenticator apps are you using?

Keep in mind that you may not see this update yet. • Use "explore": The "Explore" section of Maps is pretty easy to find, but is probably overlooked by those focused on just getting directions. The feature is particularly useful if you're traveling on business or to a new place and need to grab a quick bite to eat, and don't have time to wander around aimlessly. From the main search screen, click on the three parallel lines on the left-hand side of the search bar. (Designers call this common icon the "hamburger.") If you're zoomed into a reasonably local area, you should see the "Explore" section, which will direct you to good places to eat, cheap places to eat, nearby attractions and more. • Download an offline area: If you're going to be somewhere where you can't get cell service, take advantage of the ability to download a section of Google Maps to access offline. To do this tap in the search bar and scroll down until you see "Download a new offline area." Alternatively, you can search for a city and swipe up from the bottom, and then hit the "Download" option. Google won't let you download too large of an area -- but you can go up to 120,000 square kilometers. You can interact with this offline section of the map and search for directions to locations within that part of the world. Maps won't suggest places for you, but it will still be more useful than an old-school map. You should know that if you download a part of Google Maps, it will take up storage space on your phone. But it can be convenient, and it's way easier to transport than a paper map that you'll never be able to refold again. • Share directions: Need to let someone else know how to get to where they're going? Once you have the directions you need, hit the three-dot options menu and tap "Share Directions." That will let you text or email directions to someone through a link, or even share directions over Twitter or Facebook if you so desire. That's way easier than reading your phone's screen to someone, or trying to remember off the top of your head. Besides, your friends are probably just going to put the destination in Google Maps anyway. This feature can save both of you the trouble. • Sign-in for better service: If you're signed in to Maps it adds quite a bit of functionality -- though you're also giving Google's app more access to your information. Deciding whether the trade-off is worth it is up to you. If you sign in and turn on your history, from that point you'll be able to reference your past destinations more quickly. So, if you get a restaurant recommendation for a summer trip and then want to go back the following summer, you should be able to do that quickly. Another advantage to signing in is that you can link your Google Contacts to Google Maps, so it's easy to find your friend Jim's house by pulling it from your address book. That saves you from having to ask "Where am I going, again?" when you get in the car. You can sign in to your Google Account by hitting the hamburger icon and tapping "Sign in." • Know more about what you're getting into: There are also some settings that most users know about but likely don't use that often. On the options menu, for example, you can turn on different filters and features to get different information about where you're headed. If you're walking in a hilly city such as San Francisco, for example, you may really want to see the terrain around you. A coffee shop may look like it's just a quick walk and a few blocks away -- but those blocks may take you straight up a steep hill. That's vital information to know if you don't want to be out of breath by the time you get there. One setting I use a lot that many may find useful is the setting preference to "avoid tolls." Of course, you can't always find a toll-free way to get somewhere in the time you need, but it's still nice to have the option on hand.

 Text Size: A | A Google Maps consistently makes lists of the top 10 most-used apps and is probably one app that many people consult daily. But how much of the program do you actually use? Those who just type in an address and go should know that there's so much more you can do than just that. To help you make the most of that last, great summer road trip, we've compiled a list of tips to get more out of Google Maps. Here are some useful features hiding just below the surface. - Multistop trips: Trips aren't always about going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes there's a C, D, E or even F you have to get to as well. Google recently started rolling out a new feature that lets you plug in more than one destination at a time. Users can access this by hitting the options menu from the directions screen - you get there by hitting the three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner - and selecting "Add stop." Keep in mind that you may not see this update yet. - Use "explore": The "Explore" section of Maps is pretty easy to find, but is probably overlooked by those focused on just getting directions.

Number one AWS has nearly three times as much market share as number two Microsoft. Together the big four account for more than 50 percent of the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) market, and they grew their revenue by 68 percent in the second quarter. By comparison, the next 20 largest cloud providers grew their revenue by 41 percent, and overall the cloud computing market expanded by 51 percent during the quarter. "In a variety of ways Amazon and the other big three players have distanced themselves from the competition in this market and continue to widen the gap," Synergy Chief Analyst and Research Director John Dinsdale said. "What marks them out as different is their global presence, marketing muscle, ability to fund huge investments in hyperscale data centers and, in most cases, a determination to succeed in the market."

(AP Photo/Jim Rogash) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession The Next Billion August 06, 2016 Before there was Google, or Facebook, or YouTube, or even AOL, there was Tim. Twenty-five years ago, on Aug. 6, 1991, someone asked a question on an internet forum. The response was the first public acknowledgement of the World Wide Web—the backbone on which all websites function, and the genesis of our modern internet culture and arguably the start of the digital communication revolution in which billions of people can now talk to each other, access any piece of information or order pretty much anything they want instantaneously. The first website, which was literally a website explaining what a website was, went online in November 1992. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee, at the time a researcher at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research). But before the site went live, Berners-Lee brought up the project he was working on—hyperlinks, the technology that allows pieces of information to be linked to each other on the internet—on a Usenet page. Usenet was a pre-web forum when just a couple million people were on the internet; its archives have since been acquired by Google. If you want to find the first rumblings of the modern web online now, you have to trudge through some incompletely archived pages on Google Groups. Berners-Lee was responding to a question someone asked about whether anyone knew anyone working on the concept of hyperlinks. As one of the people directly working on that exact topic he seemed perfectly situated to respond. Here’s what he said: The WorldWideWeb (WWW) project aims to allow links to be made to any information anywhere. The address format includes an access method (=namespace), and for most name spaces a hostname and some sort of path. We have a prototype hypertext editor for the NeXT, and a browser for line mode terminals which runs on almost anything. These can access files either locally, NFS mounted, or via anonymous FTP. They can also go out using a simple protocol (HTTP) to a server which interprets some other data and returns equivalent hypertext files. For example, we have a server running on our mainframe (http://cernvm.cern.ch/FIND in WWW syntax) which makes all the CERN computer center documentation available. The HTTP protocol allows for a keyword search on an index, which generates a list of matching documents as annother virtual hypertext document. If you’re interested in using the code, mail me. It’s very prototype, but available by anonymous FTP from info.cern.ch. It’s copyright CERN but free distribution and use is not normally a problem. The NeXTstep editor can also browse news. If you are using it to read this, then click on this: <http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html> to find out more about the project. We haven’t put the news access into the line mode browser yet. We also have code for a hypertext server. You can use this to make files available (like anonymous FTP but faster because it only uses one connection). You can also hack it to take a hypertext address and generate a virtual hypertext document from any other data you have – database, live data etc. It’s just a question of generating plain text or SGML (ugh! but standard) mark-up on the fly. The browsers then parse it on the fly. The WWW project was started to allow high energy physicists to share data, news, and documentation. We are very interested in spreading the web to other areas, and having gateway servers for other data. Collaborators welcome! I’ll post a short summary as a separate article. Other than dated references to things like the NeXT computer system (the computer and company Steve Jobs developed after getting booted from Apple in 1985 before returning in 1997) and calling the web the “WorldWideWeb” as one word, what’s interesting here is how Berners-Lee envisioned the web being used. He saw it as a place that academics could share information, rather than a place that reality TV celebrities could worry about what phone to get next, or where multibillion-dollar corporations could spring up to categorize and sell advertising against all of its content. Berners-Lee followed up with a little more information on how hyperlinking would actually work: The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system. The project started with the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow information sharing within internationally dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by support groups. Reader view The WWW world consists of documents, and links. Indexes are special documents which, rather than being read, may be searched. The result of such a search is another (“virtual”) document containing links to the documents found. A simple protocol (“HTTP”) is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword search by a remote information server. The web contains documents in many formats. Those documents which are hypertext, (real or virtual) contain links to other documents, or places within documents. All documents, whether real, virtual or indexes, look similar to the reader and are contained within the same addressing scheme. To follow a link, a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a number if he or she has no mouse). To search and index, a reader gives keywords (or other search criteria). These are the only operations necessary to access the entire world of data. Information provider view The WWW browsers can access many existing data systems via existing protocols (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway. In this way, the critical mass of data is quickly exceeded, and the increasing use of the system by readers and information suppliers encourage each other. Making a web is as simple as writing a few SGML files which point to your existing data. Making it public involves running the FTP or HTTP daemon, and making at least one link into your web from another. In fact, any file available by anonymous FTP can be immediately linked into a web. The very small start-up effort is designed to allow small contributions. At the other end of the scale, large information providers may provide an HTTP server with full text or keyword indexing. The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of data format between suppliers and reader by allowing negotiation of format between a smart browser and a smart server. This should provide a basis for extension into multimedia, and allow those who share application standards to make full use of them across the web. This summary does not describe the many exciting possibilities opened up by the WWW project, such as efficient document caching. the reduction of redundant out-of-date copies, and the use of knowledge daemons. There is more information in the online project documentation, including some background on hypertext and many technical notes. Try it A prototype (very alpha test) simple line mode browser is currently available in source form from node info.cern.ch [currently 128.141.201.74] as /pub/WWW/WWWLineMode_0.9.tar.Z. Also available is a hypertext editor for the NeXT using the NeXTStep graphical user interface, and a skeleton server daemon. Documentation is readable using www (Plain text of the installation instructions is included in the tar file!). Document http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html is as good a place to start as any. Note these coordinates may change with later releases. What started out as a way of connecting researchers, in much the same way that the internet itself started out as a way of connecting universities (and military facilities), has ballooned over the last 25 years into the most important communication tool since the Gutenberg press. Sadly, most scientific research papers are not freely available online, but at least I can easily tell you which type of cookie you are, or which fast-food chain best represents you. So there’s that.

But in Mesa, Arizona, they found just a few small emitters. That’s because the city-owned utility and others around the state have been proactive in replacing and maintaining older, leak-prone pipes.   “We are proud of Mesa’s high standards when it comes to keeping our natural gas lines above safety and environmental requirements,” said Frank McRae, Energy Resources Director for the City of Mesa. “The results illustrate our dedication to safety and reliability for our customers and the city.”   The City of Mesa has a history of high standards regarding leak detection and safety. For example, Mesa Energy Resources played an active role in the development of the federal Gas Distribution Integrity Management Program, which the city adopted in 2010, a year before the required deadline. Maps showing the low number of leaks in Mesa compared to the widespread problem in other cities are at www.edf.org/climate/methanemaps. A video on the project is at http://tinyurl.com/MethaneMaps. All utilities are required to monitor their lines and quickly fix leaks that pose a safety threat. But smaller or more remote leaks can – and often do – go undetected or unrepaired for long periods. This doesn’t usually pose a safety risk, but the escaping gas – which is mostly methane – has a powerful effect on the climate, packing 84 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. Over time, those emissions can do a lot of damage; reducing them can have an immediate benefit to the climate. “Methane leaks are a serious environmental challenge for utilities everywhere, and a waste of customer resources. Fixing them is a quick way to dramatically reduce greenhouse emissions,” said Mary Gade, a former state and federal environmental official now working with EDF on the mapping project. “Mesa has done a good job keeping up with the investments needed to protect their system. The city is setting a good example for others around the country.” But even cities like Mesa have room to make further progress. To further reduce pipeline leaks, for example, EDF says that Arizona utilities should be required to use state-of-the-art measurement and detection technology, conduct more frequent leak surveys, and make the results publicly available. The Mesa City Council recently committed to improving their data practices and openness as one of the first cities selected for the Bloomberg Philanthropies “What Works Cities” initiative, making this an opportune time to consider using better data acquisition and analysis tools to advance utilities’ leak management efforts in Mesa, and throughout Arizona. “Arizona has a strong regulatory framework for leak repair and management. But better data can help ensure that utilities are investing their resources more cost effectively, and getting the biggest bang for their customer dollars,” Gade said. “Leaks that are a safety threat should always be fixed immediately, but after that, utilities should be tackling those with the greatest emissions, which pose the most serious threat to the environment.” Early detection of natural gas leaks benefits both customers and the environment, and has the potential to reduce the need for costly and disruptive emergency repairs. Utilities in New York and California are already publishing dynamic maps of their natural gas leaks. Publically sharing geographically-attributed leak data can help regulators and ratepayers track utility performance, and ensure cost-efficient emission reductions. The researchers in Mesa collected 600,000 data points driving 200 miles of roadway in and around the city, and found just three leaks. Google cars took readings in March and April 2016. The maps therefore represent a snapshot, and may not reflect current leaks due to repairs or other changes. New Technology Means Better Opportunity The mapping project was developed in collaboration with scientists at Colorado State University and Google Earth Outreach. EDF has been working with utilities in cities around the U.S., including Boston, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles to demonstrate technology to detect leaks and assess leak sizes quickly and more efficiently. Data from the project is being used by New Jersey’s largest utility, Public Service Electric and Gas, as part of an ongoing $905 million pipeline replacement program that was approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. The technology in this pilot project is newer and more sensitive than devices typically used by utilities to detect leaks on their systems. It has the capability to find and measure leaks that wouldn’t necessarily turn up or warrant repair based on safety concerns alone, but which do add up to a major environmental issue and costs to ratepayers. EDF and researchers at Colorado State University spent four years testing and fine-tuning the technology.   # # # Environmental Defense Fund (edf.org), a leading international nonprofit organization, creates transformational solutions to the most serious environmental problems.

The Google Trekker capturing Howth Head.View More Images FAILTE Ireland and Google have come up with a solution for anybody who feels like a bit of sightseeing, but can’t find the time. Ireland’s most remote and beautiful locations can now be seen on Google Street View meaning you can check out our stunning countryside without leaving the comfort of home. Locations such as Erris Head Loop on the Wild Atlantic Way, Melifont Abbey in Ireland’s Ancient East and Howth Head in Dublin can now be accessed in Street View, and seen from all angles with 360 degree views.  Throughout last year, Fáilte Ireland borrowed the Google Trekker to document many of Ireland’s remotest tourism beauty spots for Street View. The Trekker is a wearable backpack, with a camera system on top. It can be walked through pedestrian walkways or trails on foot, and automatically gathers images as it goes. And Fáilte Ireland have used it to capture some great images from along the Wild Atlantic Way, throughout Ireland’s Ancient East and in Dublin city and county. Starting along the Wild Atlantic Way, Fáilte Ireland employees captured sights such as islands like Inishbofin, Achill, the Blaskets and Dun Aengus on Inish Mor as well as other significant destinations such as Sliabh Liag, Croagh Patrick and Mizen Head. They also captured many of the highlights of Ireland’s Ancient East, including the narrow streets of medieval towns, the grounds of stately homes and iconic attractions such as Newgrange. The specialised camera was also used to capture parts of the Dublin experience, particularly many of its scenic walks in places such as Howth Head, Sandycove and the Royal Canal. Daragh Anglim, Fáilte Ireland’s Head of Marketing, explained how the project can benefit tourism. “We know that the vast majority of people use the internet to research their holidays,” he said. “People want to see where they are going even before they get here. Partnering with Google on this project means that millions worldwide will get to explore these beautiful remote parts of Ireland through stunning panoramic imagery. “We believe that when they see these images people will be encouraged to make the crucial decision to come over here to see the real thing. “In Fáilte Ireland, we are constantly searching for the most innovative and effective ways to give Ireland an edge in the competitive global tourism market. “We have world class landscapes, sights and experiences - the more we can share, the more visitors we can attract. The use of Google Trekker was therefore a logical and welcome addition to our significant investment and focus on digital channels to promote Ireland. Communications Manager with Google, Emily Clarke, also thinks the project can have huge tourism benefits. “The Google Trekker can capture Street View imagery in some of world’s remotest places, places where the car just can’t go,” she said. “And now, people around the world will be able to see the beautiful landscape of Ireland’s east coast and beyond right from their phone or computer. “We are delighted to be partnering with Fáilte Ireland to bring Street View imagery to an area of Ireland that is known for its outstanding natural beauty and we hope it will also encourage more people to visit this stunning area.” Read 1711 Email Print Related Articles 23 Nov 2016Fundraiser is a piece of cake 19 Nov 2016TRAVEL: Swap winter sun for some winter fun 13 Nov 2016Six slices of holiday paradise Latest Gallery Southside Sport Read the digital editions of the Dublin People Northside East, Northside West & Southside here Next Story HAPPENINGS: A few things worth checking out around the city 26 Oct 2016Here are a few things happening around the city over the coming days.

The company is bringing AMP results directly to search on your smartphone or tablet to make stripped-down articles and webpages easier to find. AMP is Google’s initiative to break the Web down into digestible chunks of easy-to-read articles. It strips down much of the clutter you’ll find on any webpage (likely even the one you’re reading this article on) into a more readable format with less ads. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Recently, Google announced that even ads would be AMPlified. All told, AMP is Google’s way of breaking down and rebuilding the Web it so famously catalogs for us. In mobile search, AMP webpages will show up as blue links with lightning bolts next to them (because AMP pages load so quickly, I assume). The project is currently in developer preview, but Google plans to launch it widely later this year. Its main goal with this project is to take AMP beyond news sites and into the mainstream.

By: AFP | San Francisco | Published:August 6, 2016 12:36 pm Autonomous cars were among the big-vision ideas being pursued by an X Lab at Google at the time. The chief technology officer for Google’s self-driving car mission announced on Saturday he would be hitting the road, and that the day marked his last at the company. Roboticist Chris Urmson said in a blog post that after leading the autonomous car team and helping make the leap from research to development, he is “ready for a fresh challenge.” He did not specify what that challenge might be. “I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands,” Urmson said. “It has been a privilege and honor to be part of a team that has been at the forefront of bringing this life-saving technology to the world.” Genelia Deshmukh On Being A Mother And Bollywood Career Bigg Boss 10 November 22 Review: Bani Lashes Out At Swami Om, Manoj Punjabi Demonetisation: Supreme Court Refuses To Stay Proceedings Why Is Jammu Kashmir’s Machil Sector Seen As A Safe Passage For Infiltrators Amartya Sen No Longer Part Of Nalanda University Board Government Plans To Bring GST Bills As Money Bills: Here’s Why Demonetisation: Relief For Common Man: Find Out More Salman Khan And Family Celebrate Helen’s Birthday At Galaxy Apartments Demonetisation: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Defends Government’s Move Aamir Khan’s Dangal Pales In Comparison To Surroundings Of Mahavir Singh Phogat’s Village J&K: 3 Soldiers Killed, Body Of One Mutilated In Machhal Sector PM Narendra Modi Asks People To Rate Demonetisation Ex-Gujarat Energy Minister Has Financial Interest In 8 Onshore Oil Blocks: Find Out More US President-Elect Donald Trump Lays Out Agenda For First 100 Days Modi Keynote Prank App Spurns Several Clones Urmson joined what was then a secret project inside California-based Google a little more than seven years ago. Autonomous cars were among the big-vision ideas being pursued by an X Lab at Google at the time. Urmson had previously been a research scientist on a Carnegie Mellon University self-driving car team that fielded a contender in a competition by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, an arm of the US military focused on new technology. US media reported that Urmson may have been unhappy with the project’s trajectory since a car industry executive was hired last year to turn it into its own company at Google parent Alphabet. “Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this life-saving technology will soon become a reality,” Google spokesman Johnny Luu said in response to an AFP inquiry. Luu maintained that Urmson is departing “with our warmest wishes” and would not comment on reports that he may have clashed with the team’s new boss. Google has driven its autonomous cars some 1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometers) with only some minor dust-ups. In May the company announced plans for its self-driving car programme to put down roots in the Detroit area with a technology center. The facility will house engineers and others testing vehicles provided by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Alphabet said at the time. The 53,000 square foot (5,000 square meter) center will enable Google and its partners to “further develop and refine self-driving technology,” according to Alphabet.

Enjoy! The role of social media in SEO and the question whether SEO is impacted by social media at all is often debated. This section will briefly sum up if and how SEO is impacted by social networks and go over instantly implementable best practices that are proven to be effective. The role of social media within a marketing strategy is changing. When people refer to SEO, they more often mean marketing online in general. If you have started to dive into the world of digital marketing, you already know SEO is not a term that encompasses all kinds of online marketing, but one of many significant online marketing streams. Here are some of the most common abbreviations in online marketing: SEO (search engine optimization) SEM (search engine marketing) PPC (pay per click) SMM (social media marketing) SMO (social media optimization) All of these different streams impact each other directly or indirectly. It is important to understand the differences because the importance of the role of each of these streams has changed over the years. To understand what role social media plays now and where it’s going, let’s have a look at how we got here. A couple of years ago, it was widely assumed that social media marketing and social media optimization impacted SEO directly and even well executed SEM and PPC campaigns could increase page ranks. Businesses and agencies globally integrated their social media efforts with their SEO strategies to help Google’s algorithm recognize quality content, popularity, and influence. Companies ran campaigns for keywords they wanted to rank higher for. While not all marketers agreed there was a direct influence on ranking, it certainly was supported by many. Especially after a video aired in December 2010 stating that social signals were a factor when it came to ranking. Interestingly, the same person from that video, Google’s Matt Cutts, released a video three years later that stated that Google’s algorithm does not pick up on social signals to determine the page rank (Source: Kissmetrics). Where does this leave social media in terms of SEO? Let’s see the proof: Google stated in 2013 that its algorithm doesn’t pick up on social signals. I think that is still the case because Google says it doesn’t have the capacity to index all social media posts. This means Google does not index everything that is indexable. We do know that profile and page URLs are frequently showing up on the top of the first page of Google, so having social profiles and choosing the right profile and page names are important for SEO. The video from 2010 was based on insights from Google and Bing. Bing has not issued a public announcement that discredits their statement that social media impacts rankings on Bing. The company stated it takes “into consideration how often a link has been tweeted or retweeted, as well as the authority of the Twitter users that shared the link.” (Source: Kissmetrics) Why should we care about Bing? Around 30% of searches in the United States alone are on Bing and devices and platforms like Apple’s Siri, Kindle Fire, Amazon Fire Phone, Xbox, and Twitter are powered by Bing. (Source: Entrepreneur) Additionally, social networks are search engines, too. You can search for tweets on Twitter and use Facebook to find businesses, products, and service providers. Instagram is a great sales generator for industries such as fashion, beauty, food, and fitness just to name a few. Let’s not forget about YouTube. In each case, chances are a potential customer will check out your social profiles and pages sooner or later and they typically show up – you guess it – in organic search results on Google. A Note on Featured Social Posts on Google and Timeliness Some social media posts such as tweets can show up on the top of the first page of Google like this: What you post on social does get indexed on top of the first page on Google if it is popular enough at the right point in time. This is often referred to as featured social posts. You are already familiar with featured content, for instance, the latest news articles or Wikipedia extracts that show up on top. You can optimize a social media post by inserting the respective keyword and publishing it at the right point in time or getting a lot of traffic at the right point in time. Keep in mind that Google doesn’t have the capacity to index all social media updates, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t indexed. With access to Twitter’s firehose, Google can see tweets in real-time – which is important when it comes to the timeliness of posts. Dominate Your Geographic Area Social media posts are your ticket to dominating your local area. You can check-in to locations with Facebook, post Instagram content at a specific location, and even be selected as one of the few people to live stream an event for Snapchat. Post engagement – meaning getting comments, likes, shares, or clicks – is essential here. Luckily, it doesn’t have to be organically generated engagement, so you can push this with ads if you need to. Setting Up an Effective Social Media Strategy No matter what business or industry you are in, a social media strategy is based on three main pillars: Connect Communicate Coordinate Let’s have a look at each of those pillars and see how to apply these to your business. 1. Connect The first step when setting up a social media strategy is to connect with your audience on the right platforms. To do that, you first need to determine who your audience is. No guessing, no assuming. Get the stats. You can use any analytics tools you have to figure out who your audience is. A common mistake is to limit yourself to one customer profile, e.g. mostly 25-45, male. Instead, use Google Analytics and Facebook Audience Insights to figure out who your audience is. How to Use Facebook Audience Insights to Identify Customer Profiles Ideally, you are looking to define three to five customer profiles. This does not mean all of these are part of your ideal target audience, but typically this is the amount you will find if you are looking into who your existing audience is. The trick here is not only to look at who likes your page but to plug-in conversion data. For instance, you can upload a list of email addresses you retrieved from your newsletter subscriptions or customers’ accounts and Facebook will cross reference those with email addresses linked to Facebook profiles. To upload an email list and analyze it with Facebook Audience Insights, go to your Facebook Ads Manager. Then click on the top left corner and select “Audiences:” Then create a new custom audience: A window will pop up. Select the first option, “Customer File:” Then choose the option to upload: Once the email list is uploaded, click on the top left again and choose “Audience Insights:” Then tell Facebook that you want to analyze a custom audience by selecting “A Custom Audience:” The next step is to select which custom audience you want to analyze, in this case, your email list: ADVERTISEMENT Once you select the custom audience you want to analyze, Facebook provides you with demographics including, but not limited to gender, education, income, household composition, what care they drive, if they have children, how old the children are, and more: For startups: It’s possible that you don’t like the results of your audience analysis because it’s not who you were looking to target or you don’t have an audience yet because it’s a new business. In this case, knowing who you would like to target in the future is essential when choosing the right social media platforms. Choosing the Right Social Media Platforms The first question to ask yourself is how many social media profiles and pages you want to manage in total. If you are a startup or small business, my recommendation would be three to five. If you have the funds and time to manage more, my recommendation would be 8 to 10. When deciding what social media platforms, start with the core platforms and add other platforms based on the content format they feature. Different platforms have different advantages. For instance, Google+ pages show up in organic search results with your location on Google maps on the right-hand side of the first page of Google. Additionally, if you are using Gmail or Gmail for Work, your page will show up next to emails with a follow button or your latest updates. Having a Facebook page is a must, not only because people use Facebook as a search engine to find products and service providers but also to get reviews. Facebook reviews, as well as Google+ reviews, are great for social proof. Additionally, Facebook gives you detailed demographic insights as we’ve just seen in the Facebook Audience Insights tutorial. When choosing a social network, you should consider what kind of content you can produce, what content format would be most useful to your business, and where your audience is. According to my research with over five thousand brands, the social networks that generate the most engagement are: YouTube Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest Google+ Tumblr LinkedIn Snapchat Of course, there are many more social networks, and depending on your type of business and target audience, the core platforms may be different. You should review all major social networks as well as smaller ones if they offer you exposure or traffic in a relevant niche.

Communicate Social media is always a two-way street. You connect with your audience, and they connect with you. You communicate with them through your content and timelines just as much as they communicate to you. This means there are two components to communicating on social, one requires us to listen to what our customers have to say, and the other one requires us to stay true to the brand and communicate clearly. One way to make sure your timelines are on point is to determine what the goal of using each platform is. For instance, are you looking to increase brand awareness or sales? Are you attracting new customers or increasing customer loyalty? The communication on each social network should adapt to your respective goals. Your brand should be represented visually every time you post something by using your brand’s HTML color codes, related colors, characteristic filters, and other things that help followers or potential followers identify your brand. 3. Coordinate An important part of creating a social media strategy is to create a publishing plan so you get an idea of how frequently what content will be published where. Based on that, you can then estimate how much and what kind of traffic that generates. Things to consider when creating a publishing schedule are the time you share the content and the format. Typical publishing times are: Automatic sharing instantly when content is on blog / website / journal / profile Same day as content was been posted Day after Week after Two weeks after Month after Specific date Repeated posting date When scheduling your content, consider the content turnover within the respective platforms. Twitter, for instance, is very fast paced and it’s up to you to make sure your content gets attention. Social networks like Pinterest and Tumblr, on the other hand, allow your content to resurface again so the content turnover is slower and in repeating waves. Typical content formats are: Title + link Text posts Infographics Videos Video loops Gifs Photos Images Depending on what content formats you know you can regularly generate, you can then think about how to distribute the content on the social networks you selected. For instance, do you want to adjust the image dimensions for each platform or do you want to repost the same image regardless of how it will look? Here are some of the most common dimensions for social media posts (as of July 2016): Instagram 1080 x 1080 Facebook 940 x 788 Tumblr 540 x 810 Twitter 1024 x 512 Pinterest 735 x 1102 If you can only choose one dimension, my recommendation would be to use the Instagram dimensions. They look great on all platforms and the square format is both mobile and desktop friendly. In Conclusion The best social media strategies not only consider where the market is at but look forward to where the market is going. It is no longer enough to discuss the impact social media is having on SEO. Social networks like Facebook are more and more being treated like search engines, which means that SEO will soon have to be applied within social networks. Additionally, SEO is moving more towards intent driven rankings and searches rather than determining where things show up based on just one keyword. Long-tail keywords and the intent behind the search matters more now than ever. You can adapt your social media by including long-tail keywords in titles and content, as well as offering formats that are easy to read. For instance, vertical content is ideal for Pinterest, Snapchat, and most social mobile apps, while horizontal content looks great in a Twitter and Facebook desktop feed. Overall, the more engagement you can generate with your content, the higher you rank and the more you learn about your audience. The key is to know your audience well, so you know what kind of content to post when to increase engagement. This results in reaching a larger audience and helps you achieve the social media goals you set.   Image Credits Featured Image: Image by Christina Baldassarre In-post Photo: Image by Christina Baldassarre Proceed to Chapter 14 Related Posts Social Media Versus Social Networking as a Content Marketing Strategy How to Create a B2B Social Media Strategy Planning for Progress: 18 Tips for a Successful Social Media Strategy A Social Media Marketing Guide for Non-Profits Bio Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Latest Posts Christina Baldassarre Founder & Managing Partner at Zebra Advertisement Christina Baldassarre is an entrepreneur.

Photo: Reuters Paris: Facebook and Google are the 800-pound gorillas in online advertising because of audience reach and superior targeting. They enjoy another lesser-known advantage: they’re largely immune to ad blocking. People install ad blockers to strip out marketing messages and the trackers used to target ads. They’re more widespread on computers but they’re migrating slowly to mobile too. Analysts estimate that ad blocking cost web publishers nearly $22 billion in lost ad sales last year, compared with total internet ad sales of $160 billion. Yet it’s becoming clear that the pain isn’t being shared equally, and this is more bad news for newspaper, magazine, and television companies. What started as a consumer movement sparked by rage about intrusive ads, security and privacy seems to be strengthening the internet’s big beasts. Not only does old world media lack the tech chops to beat the blockers, their fragile finances make it hard to turn away ad dollars in the name of user experience. Google and Facebook’s resources dwarf the legacy publishers. But even when looked at on a proportional basis, old media’s investment in its own future is anemic. Last year, Google spent 16.4% of revenue on R&D, according to Bloomberg data, and Facebook almost a quarter. At Daily Mail & General Trust, owner of one of the most popular news sites, it was 3.6%. Facebook is a textbook example of how technology enshrines advantage. While it was prey to ad blockers when most users preferred computers, it’s played a blinder in the shift to mobile. The ads within the mobile Facebook app (and its photo-sharing app Instagram) can’t be stripped out by blockers. They’re delivered by Facebook servers with none of the usual identifiers. Google’s main defence is its iron grip on search ads. These paid-for links, which appear by results when users look for information on plane fares or movie tickets, aren’t as annoying as pop-up ads or videos. One caveat: Google’s display advertising, such as banner ads or videos on YouTube, is more threatened by ad blockers than Facebook’s. Unlike the social media giant, Google ads aren’t sheltered within an app. Yet this is small comfort for traditional media. Once ad blocking usage hits about 20% of the population, it really starts to hurt publishers, according to John Montgomery of WPP’s GroupM. The New York Times and others are desperate for online ads to make up the shortfall from print, but it’s hard going as the chart below shows. Falling prices for their online ads, which cannot match the targeting precision of Facebook or Google, are the main culprit, but ad blockers aren’t helping. Since most publishers rely on external networks to sell their online ad space, the ads are easily identified and cut out by blockers. Efforts to coax people to turn off the blockers are becoming common, but have yet to prove effective. Blocking increases pressure on free sites such as the Daily Mail and Guardian to impose paywalls. But it’s tough to sell general news, which is freely available elsewhere. One answer could be to turn to the web giants for help. A year ago, Facebook created a tool that hosts publishers’ content within the social network, theoretically taking them off the ad blockers’ radars too. Google has a similar initiative. Yet such assistance isn’t free and makes old media ever more dependent on Silicon Valley for its future. Hardly a secure prospect for a beleaguered industry.

Google's Chris Urmson, right, showed a Google self-driving car to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, left, and Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, center, at the company's headquarters in 2015. Getty Images Advertisement Chris Urmson, chief technical officer of Google’s self-driving car efforts, said he’s leaving as the Internet company moves the project from research into the creation of products. “I am ready for a fresh challenge,” the former Carnegie Mellon University researcher said in an online post Friday. Urmson has been integral to Google’s automated-driving project since its early days in 2009. Under his watch, Google vehicles racked up 1.8 million miles of driving. He’s leaving as car manufacturers place more emphasis on the technology and race to be the first to field vehicles that don’t need human drivers. Google hired auto industry executive John Krafcik to take over the car project in 2015. The move signaled a new phase in which the company is trying to turn what was a research project into a business. Krafcik called Urmson an “incredible colleague & leader” on Twitter Friday. Related On the Road to a Driverless Future A Reunion in Detroit for Google's Self Driving Guru “The mission is in capable hands,” Urmson wrote. “There are many other problems or products this talented group of people could work on, but they’ve chosen self-driving cars because they understand the impact their work can have on making our roads safer and bringing everyday destinations within reach for millions of people.” The New York Times reported Urmson’s departure earlier. The newspaper said Urmson was unhappy with the recent direction of the project and had argued about it with Google co-founder Larry Page. When asked about the reports of him being unhappy, he said “yeah I’ve seen them.” “It’s been a long time and it’s time to see what else is out there,” he added in a phone interview. “It’s been fantastic. It was a great opportunity to build the team.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Google’s Demis Hassabis on using artificial intelligence on everything from climate change to aging. Interview by Jack Clark | August 4, 2016 Photograph by Immo Klink for Bloomberg Businessweek From The following is a condensed and edited interview with Demis Hassabis, CEO, DeepMind Technologies. What does DeepMind do? Our stated mission is to solve intelligence, and we use the word “solve,” because it can mean a few things. It means to understand intelligence, fundamentally understand it, and re-create it artificially. If you look at how civilization has been built and everything humans have achieved, it’s down to our intelligence. It’s our minds that have set us apart. So it would seem if you could solve intelligence in this way I’m talking about and make machines smart, then you could do all sorts of incredible things with that. Featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, August 8-21, 2016. Subscribe now. Photographer: Jeremy Liebman for Bloomberg Businessweek When you talk to Larry Page or other top executives at Google, are they saying, “Where are we on this? What is the status of our understanding of the brain?” Not quite. I update them regularly, and we talk about the overall capabilities of the systems and where we’ve got them to, and then I might make some analogies to brain functions. It’s more that way around rather than querying about where we are on the road map. We get discussions about “at what point should we tackle language?” It’s more that kind of question. Or, if we think about robotics, at what point are we ready to do those things? Does that mean talking about technologies you’re developing at DeepMind that may be ready to be used in Google products? Yeah, that’s right. We will have discussions about that when certain capabilities arrive. We think about “OK, so what does that open up?” We do that on multiple levels when we’re talking to various VPs at Google and various product areas. That’s already yielded some great results, actually. I think I can talk about this now. We’ve used AI to save like 15 percent of the power usage in the data centers, which is huge saving in terms of cost but also great for the environment. They were very surprised, because they’d already optimized it. I think it controls about 120 variables in the data centers. The fans and the cooling systems and so on, and windows and other things, I think, as well. They were pretty astounded. We think there might be even more; it depends on how many sensors you put in. Now that we know that works, we can maybe put more things in. You’ve said it could be decades before you’ve truly developed artificial general intelligence. Do you think it will happen within your lifetime? Well, it depends on how much sleep deprivation I keep getting, I think, because I’m sure that’s not good for your health. So I am a little bit worried about that. I think it’s many decades away for full AI. I think it’s feasible. It could be done within our natural lifetimes, but it may be it’s the next generation. It depends. I’d be surprised if it took more than, let’s say, 100 years. So once you’ve created a general intelligence, after having drunk the Champagne or whatever you do to celebrate, do you retire? No. No, because … You want to study science? Yeah, that’s right. That’s what I really want to build the AI for. That’s what I’ve always dreamed about doing. That’s why I’ve been working on AI my whole life: I see it as the fastest way to make amazing progress in science. Say you succeed and create a super intelligence. What happens next? Do you donate the technology to the United Nations? I think it should be. We’ve talked about this a lot. Actually Eric Schmidt [executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent] has mentioned this. We’ve talked to him. We think that AI has to be used for the benefit of everyone. It should be used in a transparent way, and we should build it in an open way, which we’ve been doing with publishing everything we write. There should be scrutiny and checks and balances on that. I think ultimately the control of this technology should belong to the world, and we need to think about how that’s done. Certainly, I think the benefits of it should accrue to everyone. Again, there are some very tricky questions there and difficult things to go through, but certainly that’s our belief of where things should go. When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up? Oddly enough, since about the age of 11 or 12, I’ve wanted to do this. To be an AI researcher. Around that age I was playing a lot of chess, and I was doing a lot of programming on my own. One of the first big programs I remember writing around 11 years old was a program to play Othello, or Reversi maybe you call it in the U.S. It was great, although it was a much less complex game. I wrote a traditional alpha beta search. I found a book on it, and I implemented it. It was quite a good program. It could beat my kid brother. Your brother must have been furious. He has great memories of it, actually. He was my game tester and my guinea pig. Basically, from then on I just thought, “Wow, this would be so cool if you could get computers to think and reason and offload some of your thinking to it.” There was one interesting thing that still tickles me now—this idea of setting off your machine to do a task for you. You’re going to sleep, it continues to solve it, and you wake up, and there is the solution. It feels like an extension of your mind that you are able to continue to do work while you’re asleep or even not thinking about the problem. It seemed obvious to me if you could solve intelligence, then you could use it. It would be like magic, like Arthur C. Clarke says. It does feel like the closest thing to magic, and I think we can use it for incredible good to solve all sorts of really pressing issues that we have, from climate to healthy aging and so on. I think that having more intelligence in the world would be very useful. Have you ever received any notably horrific advice? Oh, wow. I’m not sure I’ve been given any really horrific advice that stands out. I probably would have just ignored it and deleted it from my mind if it was that bad. Actually, in the past, probably during my Ph.D. when I was learning about how academia works, I remember talking to a few very senior scientists about the ability to organize science and top scientists in a different way. Everyone was saying that will be totally impossible: “You’ll never get more than 20 researchers to work together in a productive way.” I’ve been given that advice all the way as we’ve been building DeepMind. It just hasn’t held true. The sum is greater than the individual parts. Editor: Jim Aley

It goes for every industry, not only the tech industry. Just as we would congratulate any business while they grow and flourish and invent new things, if we see that they start to misuse their size and power to prevent others from growing and flourishing and investing in new things, then you have an issue with us.   Can companies gain an unfair advantage over competitors based on the data they hold? It depends. If you merge two businesses, and by merging the sets of data it becomes de facto impossible for somebody to enter that business space, then you have an issue. We haven’t had those concerns yet, but we’re very much concerned that they will occur.   There’s an implicit contract with internet services. A person hands over data in exchange for the service. Is the collection of people’s data an area that deserves more government regulation? It deserves a lot more attention, for people to realize that as always there is no such thing as a free lunch. There is no such thing as a free app. Obviously, you pay. And now you pay with your data.   The problem when it comes to paying with data is, it’s very hard to see what the exchange rate is. The reason I don’t use loyalty cards is that I find the exchange rate is very bad for me, because they get all my data—they know what I buy, they can figure out the age of my children, if I entertain guests, etc. But what I get is maybe a discount on washing powder that I don’t even want to buy. Why would I want that? Or I get customized shopping, which in my opinion limits my focus of attention, because maybe I would like to try something different than what an algorithm would suggest.   Google has been the subject of intense scrutiny by the European Commission. What would you like to see the company do differently? We only open a case if we have strong evidence that a company is misusing its dominant position—that Google is promoting itself in neighboring markets [such as shopping] and not applying the same penalties [in its search rankings] to its products that it does to its competitors’ in those neighboring markets. From my point of view, I want the competitors to have a fair chance of making it. If you can’t present your innovations to customers, why innovate?   What if the competitors’ products just aren’t as good? People don’t seem to have a problem with Google’s quality. That’s not the question. You don’t know if someone can come up with something better. Just because something is good doesn’t mean it’s the end of innovation. If it was, well then, we’d still be in horse carriages.   But isn’t there a choice? You’re investigating Google because people need to sign up for its services when they use Android. Can’t somebody download another search or e-mail app for their phone? If everything is presented to you, then your impetus to look for something new is so much smaller. Android is a very good operating system—open source. But how Android is used seems to place customers in a lot of instances on a one-way Google Street. That’s because you want an out-of-the-box experience, and even before you start thinking there is something else, you’re in a 100 percent Google experience.   There’s a fresh generation of technology firms that have quickly become dominant in new markets. Uber in particular has raised record amounts of money, and it’s been accused of unfair business practices. Not only have they raised a lot of money, but they have raised a lot of hostility. You can hardly find a European member state where there is not a lawsuit. What we have been trying to do from the European Commission side is to say it is very important to have a market that’s open to new ways of doing business, but it’s completely legitimate to have demands on those new businesses—taxation and consumer protections, maybe social issues of working, environment—that are in line with the European way of thinking.   Is Uber, or are others such as Airbnb, acting anti-competitively? Not necessarily. The complaints the commission has received have been more from labor unions and people who worry about whether taxes are being paid. It’s no surprise either that in some markets they cause hostility, because it’s an obvious threat to people’s jobs. That, of course, is not necessarily a competition law enforcement issue. It’s an issue in the marketplace and, sometimes, an issue for the regulator, to make sure we have a level playing field.   You’re fairly active on Twitter. Do you attract the hostility and the trolling many women experience? Yes, but it seems to be much harder to be really angry in just 140 characters. I like Twitter much more than Facebook. For me it’s a personal challenge, because I tend to talk a lot—so to be confined to 140 characters is a challenge.   As you’ve investigated the technology sector, have you changed how you use the internet? I’ve become slightly more obsessed with data security and much more reluctant to give away my data. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

If you have the app installed on your phone, you should be able to tap the Google logo at the top to kick off a few mini “Fruit Games,” including an endless runner where you’ll try to move your little strawberry as far along the road as possible before he or she gets squashed.

Roboticist Chris Urmson said in a blog post that after leading the autonomous car team and helping make the leap from research to development, he is "ready for a fresh challenge." He did not specify what that challenge might be. "I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands," Urmson said. "It has been a privilege and honor to be part of a team that has been at the forefront of bringing this life-saving technology to the world." Urmson joined what was then a secret project inside California-based Google a little more than seven years ago. Autonomous cars were among the big-vision ideas being pursued by an X Lab at Google at the time. Urmson had previously been a research scientist on a Carnegie Mellon University self-driving car team that fielded a contender in a competition by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, an arm of the US military focused on new technology. US media reported that Urmson may have been unhappy with the project's trajectory since a car industry executive was hired last year to turn it into its own company at Google parent Alphabet. "Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this life-saving technology will soon become a reality," Google spokesman Johnny Luu said in response to an AFP inquiry. Luu maintained that Urmson is departing "with our warmest wishes" and would not comment on reports that he may have clashed with the team's new boss. Google has driven its autonomous cars some 1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometers) with only some minor dust-ups. In May the company announced plans for its self-driving car program to put down roots in the Detroit area with a technology center. The facility will house engineers and others testing vehicles provided by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Alphabet said at the time. The 53,000 square foot (5,000 square meter) center will enable Google and its partners to "further develop and refine self-driving technology," according to Alphabet. Google added 100 new 2017 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid vehicles to its fleet of self-driving vehicles in a major expansion that same month. The collaboration with Fiat Chrysler marked the first time the internet giant has worked directly with an automaker to build self-driving vehicles. The tech giant began testing its autonomous driving technology in 2009 using a Toyota Prius equipped with Google equipment. It now has some 70 vehicles, including Lexus cars, adapted by Google in addition to its in-house designed cars unveiled in 2014. - AFP Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Thousands flee Myanmar clashes to China: Beijing...

 BlackBerry launches suite of apps on Android through subscription BI Intelligence Aug. 5, 2016, 10:30 PM 3,255 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Android users aren't switching to Apple's iPhone 7 Apple may bring Siri to iMessage Here's why 5G is poised to take off This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. BlackBerry will begin offering its Hub+ suite of apps for download on the Google Play store via a subscription service ($0.99 a month), the company announced. The BlackBerry Hub+ suite, one of the most popular features of BlackBerry 10, is a suite of apps that centralize all of a user’s communications in a single interface along with other productivity tasks such as contacts, calendar, passwords, and notes. The announcement is just the latest in a string of efforts by BlackBerry to remain relevant in the mobile market. BlackBerry is hoping the release of Hub+ to Android devices will encourage ex-BlackBerry loyalists to download the free trial and ultimately subscribe for the full suite. Hub+ is already available on all devices running BB 10, however, its two newest devices, the PRIV and the soon to be released DTEK50, are the last smartphones the company plans to release this year as it struggles to get consumers to purchase the devices. But with only 15% of Android devices running Marshmallow, there most likely will be fairly low penetration, reports Fortune. BlackBerry is hoping to make the suite available to users on the Android Lollipop, which accounts for 35% of all Android phones currently in use. BlackBerry’s decision to offer Hub+ comes as the company attempts to increase its software and services segments amid its crashing hardware sales. Subscription-based apps offer publishers a more consistent, recurring fee, rather than relying on sporadic in-app purchases. It’s likely that more publishers will begin adopting this model as app stores, like Google Play, seek to bolster their app revenue businesses. Both Google Play and the App Store recently announced plans to give publishers that used subscription models a greater cut of in-app revenue — from 70% to 85%. Cutting through the noise of an overcrowded app market is critical for any app developer looking to build a viable user base. There are now well over 3 million apps available across the world’s five largest app stores. Delivering the right product to the right audience at the right time in this environment is imperative to the success of any app. The challenge of marketing an app effectively has made app-install ads — an ad unit that directs users to download a mobile app — an essential tool for developers seeking to stand out in the Google Play and Apple app stores. This is why it's not surprising that more marketers are using paid channels to drive downloads than ever before. In fact, over 80% of respondents in a survey of the top 100 grossing mobile app developers noted they plan on increasing their spend on app-install ads in 2015. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile app-install ads that looks at the revenues from app-install ads and how they're expected to grow over the next five years. It also looks at the performance of app-install ads and how these metrics are expected to change over time. Furthermore, the report examines the top app-install ad products and pricing models offered by the leading advertising platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Google, as well as newer app-install formats from Instagram and Snapchat. Looking to the future, the report examines how companies are shifting their app-install ad spend to new formats, as well as the new tools they're using to improve optimization and ad effectiveness. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Mobile app-install ads — ad units that direct users to download a mobile app — are an essential tool for developers, and they account for a major share of mobile ad spend. We estimate 25% of total US mobile ad revenue was generated by app-install ads in 2015. A combination of new developers entering the space and rising ad budgets will drive increased spending in years to come. US app-install ad revenue will grow to over $7 billion by year-end 2020, according to BI Intelligence estimates. Mobile app install advertisers have traditionally invested heavily in display and interstitial ads, but are moving to mobile video and native install formats. 86% of developers currently use in-feed video app-install ads, and video ads are seen as the most effective app-install format. As formats like video rise in popularity, older formats are losing their appeal for install campaigns. Static nonnative ads are widely used but are not seen as effective. Free app networks and offer walls have also fallen out of favor. Ad platforms are now developing innovative new install formats to earn even more revenue from these lucrative ad units. New approaches, including deep linking and app streaming, are more contextualized and interactive than older ad formats. In full, the report: Forecasts app-install ad spending in the US through 2020. Explores which app-install ad formats developers believe are most effective. Discusses what the most popular platforms and ad networks are doing to attract ad spending.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author SEO Bootcamp for Beginners How to Run an SEO Test in 5 Steps 7 Steps to Write Content that Converts Online sales topped $341 billion in the United States in 2015, more than a third of all retail sales that year, and a 14.6% increase from 2014. This makes it the sixth straight year of double-digit growth for eCommerce revenue. That’s a pretty substantial pie. However, with at least 110,000 ecommerce companies in 2014, the competition can get pretty fierce. If you’re an eCommerce company either looking to boost your sales, or just getting started, you need to start by turning your attention to organic search traffic and SEO. Why Does SEO Matter for eCommerce? Optimizing your website for organic search traffic is vital for your sales. Here are some numbers laying out the role search engines play in the online sales process: 44% of people begin shopping with an online search. Almost a third of eCommerce traffic comes from search engine results pages. 26% of online purchases come from organic search traffic. The top-ranked page in Google SERPs get 32.5% of search traffic, almost double the share that goes to the second-ranked page. The top five pages get 75% of the traffic. The top 10 get 90%. To put that in terms of dollars and cents, search engine traffic has a hand in about $150 billion in revenue and millions of unique users (82 million monthly users for Amazon alone). So if you want to compete you need to rank, and rank highly. Keyword Research Keyword research is a foundational step of on page SEO. If your goal is to rank highly in search results, you need to know what your potential customers are looking for and then build your site to include those keywords. For eCommerce sites, your keyword research will also influence how you build your site architecture and URLs. You really do need to take this step seriously. The first step of keyword research is coming up with a seed list of keywords. When starting this step, look to your category and product pages. Think of them as landing pages for your visitors — generally speaking, the majority of your traffic and conversions will come through these pages. Then ask yourself, what search terms would you use to find products in those categories (or subcategories)? Don’t stick to just the basic one-word searches — think of long-tail keywords with up to four or five words to make sure you’re targeting in-market searchers. After you’ve brainstormed a solid list of keywords, it’s time to expand it. There are lots of keyword research tools out there that will help you come up with an expanded list of keywords by appending every letter of the alphabet to your keyword and scraping Google’s suggested keywords. This will help you find keywords that more accurately reflect what your potential customers are searching for. There are other tools you can use to find related keywords straight from the source: search engines. Google Keyword Planner Part of Google’s AdWords paid platform, Keyword Planner, was originally built to help advertisers do keyword research for their paid campaigns (don’t worry — it’s free to sign up and use). However, it’s also a great tool for organic keyword research. It can provide you with information regarding keywords’ popularity and competitiveness on Google. Once you’ve got an AdWords account, Keyword Planner is available in the Tools tabs at the top of the page. You can use the search for new keywords to find a list of relevant keywords and identify monthly search volume. If you’ve got a CSV of keywords from a tool like Ubersuggest, upload them under ‘Get search volume data and trends’ to find their average monthly searches, competition and suggested bid. It’s worth noting that while Keyword Tool’s competitiveness and suggested bids are AdWords-specific metrics, you can still use them to extrapolate organic search data. Keywords are highly competitive and have high bids because they demonstrate searchers’ commercial intent — there’s money to be made from them. So you can usually correlate highly competitive keywords to suggested bids to keywords that in-market people are searching for. Be careful, though, to avoid targeting overly competitive keywords; if they’re too general you’ll struggle to rank against the big players in your industry and wind up with high bounce rates and low conversion rates. The Keyword Planner tool is also a good opportunity to come up with some latent semantic index (LSI) keywords. LSI keywords are words or phrases that are synonyms or topically relevant to your keyword. For example if your keyword is [bedspreads], your LSI keywords could be [bedding] or [duvet cover]. Search Keyword Planner’s Keyword ideas and Ad group ideas to find inspiration for LSI keywords. Bing Webmaster Tools Bing Webmaster Tool’s Keyword Research feature works in much the same way as Google’s Keyword Planner. After you enter a keyword and select a region and language, Bing will come back with up to six months’ worth of search volume and historical trends. It will also generate a list of related keywords. Use the Search Keywords section under Reports & Data to find which keywords are currently bringing traffic to your site. See how you’re performing for your targeted keywords, and maybe uncover any that you didn’t realize you were ranking for. This report includes clicks, impressions, click through rate (CTR), average position in Bing and average click position. Google Search Console Find your Search Analytics report in Google Search Console under Search Traffic. Like Bing Search Keywords, Search Analytics lets you find which keywords brought traffic to your site in the previous 90 days and includes clicks, impressions, CTR and average search position. Search Console, though, lets you slice and dice your data to make it even more useful. You can filter the report to see which keywords drive the most traffic to a category page or what your most popular mobile keywords are. Filter by query to see performance for your branded keywords or keywords that include specific words like a category or product. Compare by dates to measure weekly or monthly progress and spot trends. This graph will help you answer important questions like “how are my branded keywords doing month-to-month?”, “what keywords are driving traffic to my product pages?” or “how are people finding me on mobile search?” On Page SEO Now that you’ve got a list of keywords, it’s time to put them into your product and category pages. A well-optimized eCommerce page includes three main elements: the title tag, meta description and page content. Title Tag Title tags are a bit of HTML used by browsers in tab titles and bookmark descriptions, by social media sites when displaying links posted by users and by search engines when displaying search snippets. They are also one of the most important elements of on page SEO; include your page’s most important keyword here. Search engines rely heavily on title tags to tell them what the content on the page is about and therefore the relevance of the page to a searched keyword. Obviously, you want to include your page’s primary keyword in the title tag. However, for an eCommerce site, that’s not always enough. You should also add in commercial modifiers to help you show up in long-tail keyword searches, which indicate that a searcher is more likely to convert. Some common shopping terms to include in your title tags are: Sale Deals Review Cheap Free shipping (if you actually offer it) If you sell men’s shoes, your title tag could look like: <title>Men’s Dress Shoes on Sale with Free Shipping</title> Meta Description Meta descriptions used to be important for your SEO, but Google doesn’t directly rely on them much anymore. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t important for your SEO. A signal search engines do rely on is CTR, and meta descriptions can play an integral part in maximizing clicks. Search engines use meta descriptions when creating search snippets, the page title, link and description that appear in search results. Keywords that appear in snippets are displayed in bold, drawing the user’s eye and mouse — think of them as little advertisements for your page. Try to include some keywords here (without packing, of course). You can see this in action below for the keyword [men’s brown leather shoes]: Give your meta tags a bit of a boost by injecting some clickbaiting online shopping terms. This is the same idea as for your title tags, except meta descriptions give you more characters to work with. Some good commercial terms to use in your meta tags include: Best prices on _____ today. Get X% off _____ now. Find _______ on sale. Buy _______ and get FREE shipping today. Click here to get the best _______ at the lowest prices. The meta description for your men’s dress shoes category page could be something along the lines of: <meta>Looking for men’s dress shoes? Get top brand Oxfords, monks, derbies and loafers with FREE shipping! Click here to find the best deals on all styles & colors.</meta> Page Content Creating content for your category and product pages can represent a challenge for your SEO efforts. How do you write quality content that not only attracts organic search traffic, but also converts it into sales? First of all, you need to create longer, in-depth content. The average first page result has almost 2,000 words per page. Obviously that’s a lot to expect for every product page, and runs the risk of some serious reader fatigue. Set your sights on at least 1,000 words per page. That probably still sounds like a huge number but you’ll get there more easily than you think. Product Descriptions The first piece of content you should start with is the product description. It’s absolutely vital that you don’t just copy and paste the manufacturer’s product description. If you do this, you’ll end up publishing duplicate content and won’t even make it onto the SERPs. When writing your description, keep your target keyword list handy. Mention your primary keyword three to five times throughout the description. You don’t need to worry about how densely the keyword is used, just using it a few times (3–5 is ideal) will tell the search engine what the page is about. This is also a great place to include a few of the LSI keywords you came up with earlier. Take the time to think about how many different versions of this page you’ve created. Depending on your platform you could have unique URLs for different product versions such as color, size or material, each displaying the same product description and/or reviews. If you find yourself in this situation, start by consolidating the different versions onto a single page with the different options listed on the page or in a drop down menu. Use 301 redirects and the rel="canonical” tag to automatically reroute traffic and link juice to the consolidated product page. If your eCommerce platform doesn’t let you do this, consider switching to one that does, like Shopify or Magento. Reviews Ideally, after you’ve written your product description you’ll only need a few hundred more words to reach that 1,000-word threshold. That’s where product reviews come in. Amazon’s guidelines for customer reviews puts the ideal length at 75 to 100 words per review. Once you’ve got four or five reviews, you’ll be approaching the ideal length of quality, on-topic content to appear in Google’s first page results. Product reviews bring the added bonus of boosting your conversions: adding just one customer review boosts sales by 10%. They’ll also keep your page “alive,” which encourages search engines to crawl your page more often and provides an overall SEO lift. Use your customer product reviews to stand out in search results pages by implementing rich snippets on your page. Use Schema markup on your product pages to add the review information to your search snippet: There’s no guarantee Google or Bing will include your structured data, but they can’t if you don’t include it. For more help on adding structured data markup to your page, check out Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper. Use Google Search Console’s Structured Data area under Search Appearance to make sure the search engine can find your Schema.org makeup. Wrapping It All Up At the end of the day, everything you do to your site comes down to one thing: driving sales. As we established in the beginning of this piece, if you’re an eCommerce site, a large portion of your sales are starting off as organic search engine traffic. But in order to take advantage of the benefits organic traffic has to offer, you need to focus on your SEO. Remember: Search engine optimization isn’t an overnight process. Nor is it a set and forget it deal. Search engines, and your competitors, are constantly making changes that you’ll need to stay on top of to keep your strategy up to date. However, with the right on page adjustments and content optimizations, you’ll find that your efforts can more than pay off with an increase in qualified, targeted traffic that converts into sales and revenue.

Urmson announced his departure in a post on Medium, noting that after the seven-and-a-half years that he has been involved with the autonomous car project, Google is finally “developing a product that we hope someday anyone will be able to use.” That’s a long way from the pre-Google DARPA grand challenges that Urmson worked on with his team from Carnegie Mellon to develop early autonomous cars that could navigate through the desert and a mock city a decade ago. John Krafcik, the CEO of Google’s self-driving car division, who joined the team last year from Hyundai, tweeted, “Chris is an incredible colleague [and] leader. Thank you for your passion [and] humility. Good luck on your new adventures!” “Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea,” said a spokesperson for Google’s self-driving car project. “Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this life-saving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes.” According to Recode, Jiajun Zhu, principal software engineer for the project, and according to The New York Times, Dave Ferguson, another software lead, have departed as well. A Google executive recently said the self-driving car project is “close to graduating from X,” suggesting that the project is nearly ready to stand alone as a business unit rather than as part of Alphabet’s special projects division.

A Political and Literary Forum Menu Close Search Close Support Boston Review Become a Member Class & Inequality Unraveling the Silicon Valley Consensus Ben Armstrong Jul 26, 2016 14 Min read time Topics: economy labor cities Share: Photograph by Gabriel Jorby In June 2014, a sleek tour bus parked beside a Family Dollar store in Pittsburgh’s gentrifying East Liberty neighborhood. It looked like a rock band was arriving at its concert venue. The bus had come to visit AlphaLab Gear, a startup hub located just blocks away from Google’s colorful Pittsburgh offices in a converted Nabisco factory. The bus and its passengers were part of an initiative called Rise of the Rest led by former AOL CEO Steve Case. It’s a Silicon Valley investor’s tour of startups in cities not typically considered tech hubs. Consistent with the startup ethos, AlphaLab Gear’s floorplan is open, its ceiling ducts exposed. Case and a panel of judges sat at an elevated table as companies pitched their ideas from below. New firms with only a handful of employees made wild claims about their future growth. The best startup pitch—a shoe sole that generates enough energy to charge a cell phone—received a prize before Case and his team hopped back on the bus and drove on. First to Cincinnati, then Nashville, then to the seventeen other cities that the tour has visited to date. Case’s bus tour is one example of a broader effort to identify and develop the “Next Silicon Valley.” Slate identifies thirty-one cities around the world that have received the moniker “Next Silicon Valley” from news outlets including The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, NPR, and the BBC. New York City has claimed the title Silicon Alley; Kansas City considers itself Silicon Prairie; and Dublin, Ireland calls its tech scene Silicon Docks. In many of these places, city governments have subscribed to a kind of Silicon Valley mimicry. They have launched incubators, supported investor incentives, and sponsored innovation challenges like hackathons with big prizes—all with the hope that high-growth startups will follow.   The Silicon Valley Consensus is that innovative cities grow faster than non-innovative ones—but that’s not always the case. Michael Piore, an MIT economist, calls governments’ enthusiasm for supporting high-tech entrepreneurship the “Silicon Valley Consensus.” The Washington Consensus of the 1980s claimed that free trade and deregulation were the most promising growth policies for developing countries. The Silicon Valley Consensus suggests that innovative cities grow faster, that startups are the only real hope for job creation, and that high-tech growth helps rich and poor alike. But, like the Washington Consensus, the Silicon Valley Consensus offers a false promise. Why Pittsburgh and not Cleveland? While some American cities that have seen rapid growth since 1980 have been tech hubs, such as Boston and Seattle, other high-growth cities, such as Nashville and Madison, have excelled in diverse industries. Less than half of the twenty-five metros with the fastest income and employment growth since 1980 have a concentrated high-tech sector. The case of Pittsburgh is telling. Its economy is among the fastest-growing of U.S. metro areas, but its growth did not originate with high-tech startups. It began its rise long before Case or Google showed up. The steel industry along Pittsburgh’s three rivers collapsed dramatically in the early 1980s. Between 1979 and 1983, the metro area lost over 100,000 jobs, nearly 9 percent of its total workforce. Imagine the riverfront—formerly crowded with busy steel mills—beset with an empty, eerie calm. Soon after the city’s economic collapse, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the presidents of its two leading universities—with support from the business community—crafted a recovery plan they called Strategy 21. It focused on expanding public infrastructure like highways and the airport while also developing new research infrastructure at Pittsburgh’s universities: the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon, and the Robotics Institute, also at CMU. Strategy 21 wasn’t a reflexive response to crisis. It built on decades of foundation grants and university initiatives that had sought to help Pittsburgh diversify its economy in anticipation of steel’s decline. The recovery “wish list” totaled $550 million. Since the coalition of Pittsburgh’s leaders couldn’t fund these projects on their own, they reached out for federal and state support. Congressional lobbying helped the coalition win funding worth over $100 million from the Department of Defense for the Software Engineering Institute. Backing from Westinghouse helped Pittsburgh’s universities win National Science Foundation funding for the Supercomputing Center. And Pennsylvania’s state government proposed grants and loans that would help make Strategy 21 a reality. Pittsburgh’s strategy was to listen to what businesses say they care about most in survey after survey: skilled workers and reliable infrastructure. Although many of Pittsburgh’s neighbors have tried to attract businesses with tax breaks and cheap capital, businesses consistently rank these factors as less important. By the mid-1990s, employment and income in the Pittsburgh metro area started to take off faster than that of its neighbors. Over a decade later, Pittsburgh weathered the recession far better than most of the country. Today the riverfront hums with commuting cyclists. Sunlight reflects off glassy buildings affiliated with local universities and corporations. Since 1990, the metro area’s income per capita has grown 153 percent. That’s 22 percent faster than the average for large American cities during the same period. And Pittsburgh’s employment rate grew 5 times as fast as the national average—10 percent compared to 2 percent. Pittsburgh’s investment in transportation and R&D infrastructure was not focused on incubating startups as much as it was designed to attract top technical talent to the city and keep it there. The same technical talent would prompt companies like Mellon Bank—after it merged with the Bank of New York—to keep thousands of employees in Pittsburgh instead of moving them to New York City. Today, although investors like Case focus on Pittsburgh’s startups, young tech companies comprise only a tiny segment of the Pittsburgh economy. The growth of financial institutions, hospitals, universities, and advanced manufacturing has been far more significant. This is not to say that startups have not been growing. However, startup growth is a consequence—not a cause—of Pittsburgh’s economic success. Skeptics might claim that Pittsburgh’s growth was lucky. It is possible that infrastructure had little to do with it: perhaps other cities made similar investments in infrastructure and experienced no growth at all. Some might point to Cleveland—only a two-hour drive northwest of Pittsburgh—as an example of big plans with few results. As Cleveland’s industrial economy began declining in the early 1980s—albeit less sharply than Pittsburgh’s—a group of Cleveland business leaders assembled a committee called Cleveland Tomorrow. Although the local business community had helped elect the mayor, the initiative was a decidedly private enterprise. Neither government nor university officials played a leading role in the effort. The core membership came from Cleveland’s manufacturing industries. Cleveland Tomorrow hired local consultants from McKinsey and Co. to diagnose the city’s economic problems and propose fixes. In a way the report paralleled Pittsburgh’s Strategy 21: there were recommendations to re-invest in manufacturing, and there were ideas for diversifying the local economy. However, the proposals to revitalize manufacturing were much grander than the ideas to diversify. Cleveland Tomorrow ended up investing $105 million in the recommendations. They funded a Productivity Center aimed at improving labor productivity as well as the Advanced Manufacturing Program and the Cleveland Research Institute to generate new technologies and provide resources for companies focused on advanced manufacturing. The business leaders also invested in a venture capital fund to support Cleveland entrepreneurs and additional business resources to shepherd their startups to growth. Today the Advanced Manufacturing Program survives as an organization called MAGNET that operates as a consultant for manufacturing businesses. The Cleveland Research Institute and other attempted partnerships with local universities from the 1980s have mostly dissolved. The venture capital fund was profitable, but not because Cleveland-based firms took off. When the fund could not find enough startups in Cleveland to fund, it started backing companies outside the region that turned out to be successful. The Cleveland Tomorrow experience shows that not just any infusion of cash generates growth or transformation. Investments in transit infrastructure and R&D infrastructure—supported by a lasting coalition of government, industry, and universities—are more likely to pay dividends than tax relief for plants or easy capital for startups. Decades later, in 2004, the state of Ohio passed the Third Frontier initiative, a series of private grants and financial incentives for high-tech enterprises to form in or move to Ohio. Around the same time, a gaggle of new economic development initiatives were formed in Ohio with similar ambitions: encourage new startups and give them the funding and mentorship to succeed. The program is primarily focused on supporting private industry, not public infrastructure. Although it is too early to guess whether the program has been transformative for Ohio regions like Cleveland, there’s a larger question at stake. Does the basic premise behind programs like the Third Frontier make sense? Are cities with more innovation more likely to grow and thrive? Are startup hubs better equipped for job creation than cities with older firms? Are Silicon Cities more likely to help the middle class? In other words, even if the Third Frontier and programs like it succeed at turning their regions into innovative startup hubs, where would that leave these cities and their residents? Innovative Cities Don’t Grow Much Faster City governments have a basic goal: more local jobs with higher pay. Cities are searching for ways to support income and employment growth. Innovation has been sold as a pathway to both. The OECD, for example, says innovation “provides the foundation for new businesses, new jobs, and productivity growth.” The Silicon Valley Consensus suggests that innovative cities tend to grow faster than non-innovative ones, but that’s not always the case. Since 2000, large U.S. cities with more innovation—quantified by the number of patents for inventions—have not, on average, experienced more growth in income per capita or employment. If we include the dotcom bubble of the 1990s, more innovative cities showed slightly more income growth but no more employment growth than less innovative cities. For example, if a city with low innovation like Chattanooga suddenly achieved San Francisco’s level of innovation, it would see only an additional 0.5 percent income growth per capita per year. By contrast, Chattanooga’s income per capita already grew at over 5 percent per year during this period. For another example, the San Jose metro area—the heart of Silicon Valley—stands out as the most innovative in the U.S. It has more than double the patents for inventions of the next most innovative metro. Yet San Jose is tenth in a composite of income and employment growth since 1980. Cities like Nashville and Portland have experienced more growth during this period, but lag far behind on prominent measures of innovation. More than anything else, these data suggest caution for the Silicon Valley evangelists. While some of the most innovative metro areas like Silicon Valley and Austin have achieved high growth, the trend is not universal. Many of the fastest-growing cities in the past decades were able to grow without incubators or venture investment. Startups are not the only source of growth and should not be the main focus of economic policy. Startups Don’t Necessarily Lead to Job Growth Silicon Valley boosters might argue that even if patents aren’t associated with job growth, it’s still startups and small businesses that create jobs. The U.S. Small Business Administration says that small businesses represent “66 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s.” The Kauffman Foundation, which advocates for and performs research on entrepreneurship, reports that “new businesses account for nearly all net new job creation.” Claims like these have generated a chorus of praise for small business and startups among politicians. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy,” President Obama says. “Startups are engines of job creation,” says a White House statement. Economists confirm part of the political rhetoric: a disproportionate chunk of net new jobs (jobs created minus jobs lost) come from young firms (firms zero to five years old are considered “startups”). However, the size of a business isn’t closely correlated with its likelihood of creating jobs. John Haltiwanger and colleagues show that small firms are just as likely to create jobs as large firms of the same age. Yet young firms are more likely to create jobs than old firms of the same size. On the surface, this affirms that startups are an important source of job growth at the national level. However, there are several reasons to question whether our economic policy should fixate on startups. First, startup jobs represent only a small chunk of overall employment. For most metropolitan areas, young firms provide less than 20 percent of private jobs. And many of these firms are not startups in the way that Silicon Valley might imagine them. These young firms include retail or service businesses that operate strictly in the local economy. They are not necessarily exporting a product or service that would bring new economic activity to a region. Second, although startups account for the bulk of net new jobs, it’s less clear whether cities with more startup are more likely to experience overall employment or income growth. A thriving city economy needs healthy firms of all ages. Not only can mature firms benefit from active young companies that compete with them. Young companies often draw on seasoned talent from mature firms to feed their initial growth. Many of the most successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere start their careers at mature companies. Third, even if we believe that startup jobs are great for the economy, we still can’t be sure that government support for startups is leading to more startups jobs. Of course governments make bold claims about how many jobs their tax or incentive programs have created. For example, Ohio boasts that $154 million in startup investments (half of which was public money) from its Third Frontier program have created 2,584 jobs since 2006. By claiming credit for these jobs, Ohio is making the dubious assumption that these startups would not have hired people if the Third Frontier Program didn’t exist. The startups that succeed with support from Third Frontier could have succeeded with support from another investor. If Ohio really wants to measure the effect of Third Frontier, they would compare companies that just barely qualified for Third Frontier funding and the companies that barely missed qualifying. Ten years after they applied to Third Frontier, what’s the difference between Third Frontier startups and the others? Startups are important to a local economy. New businesses generate excitement, support experimentation, and challenge their more mature competitors to improve. However, startups are not the only nor the most promising source of growth, and they should not be the overwhelming focus of economic policy. Tech Jobs Are Not Always Good for Working People Over the past several years, grassroots activists in San Francisco have protested what they see as the tech community’s contributions to exploding rents and widening inequality. The symbol of tech-inspired injustice became the Google Bus: a massive unmarked shuttle lumbering through city neighborhoods, stopping periodically to drop tech workers at stops near their homes. The perception is often that Silicon Valley’s dominance benefits only those who work in the industry and disrupts the lives of those who do not. Silicon Valley enthusiasts disagree. They argue that growth in the technology industry provides spillover benefits to the economy as a whole. For every tech job created in a city, the Bay Area Council argues, four other jobs are created in the local economy. Tech workers increase demand for local services like restaurants, dry cleaners, and salons—hiring tech workers has a multiplier effect on local economies, the argument goes. Both are partially correct. While it’s true that low-income households in innovative cities have not experienced more wage growth than low-income households in other cities, it’s not clear that higher-income households have been that much better off in innovative cities than elsewhere. Growing inequality is a problem everywhere—not just in places with a thriving tech industry. And while tech hiring does generate some positive spillovers, it’s important to remember that innovative cities are no more likely to experience employment growth than non-innovative cities. High-tech cities are an example of both success and failure when it comes to generating income growth at all levels. In San Jose, income growth for the top 10 percent is far higher than median income growth, and median income growth is far higher than income growth for the bottom 10 percent. Income growth in Austin, by contrast, has been among the most even of all U.S. cities. • • • The flash and celebrity of Silicon Valley’s rise has overshadowed success stories in the rest of the United States that possess equally powerful lessons for economic growth. When Steve Case arrived in Pittsburgh and Nashville and Charleston, the symbols of these cities’ successes were incubator spaces and chic startup offices. However, these cities began their rise decades ago without a high-tech “scene.” Even cities that we consider tech hubs, such as Austin and Durham, began their rapid growth not with startups but with big investments in knowledge infrastructure from the 1970s onward. For Durham it was the establishment of Research Triangle Park as a non-profit supported by local industry, universities and the governor. In Austin it was a joint effort between the University of Texas, Ross Perot, and the state government to attract MCC, a research association focused on semiconductors. The stories behind these cities’ successes are more complex than one event or company or investment. They are the function of long-term coalitions and advances across many industries—some of which have grown more than expected, and others of which have shrunk less. The Silicon Valley consensus has formed (and billions of public dollars have been invested) despite scant evidence that cities can become the next Silicon Valley—or that becoming the next Silicon Valley would even be desirable. The consensus has suggested that struggling cities should look west if they wish to rise. It would be more promising for cities to look in all directions—and perhaps in the mirror—for lessons on how to grow. The Silicon Valley Consensus offers a false promise.

But how much of the program do you actually use? Those who just type in an address and go should know that there's so much more you can do than just that. To help you make the most of that last, great summer road trip, we've compiled a list of tips to get more out of Google Maps. Here are some useful features hiding just below the surface. - Multistop trips: Trips aren't always about going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes there's a C, D, E or even F you have to get to as well. Google recently started rolling out a new feature that lets you plug in more than one destination at a time. Users can access this by hitting the options menu from the directions screen - you get there by hitting the three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner - and selecting "Add stop." Keep in mind that you may not see this update yet. - Use "explore": The "Explore" section of Maps is pretty easy to find, but is probably overlooked by those focused on just getting directions. The feature is particularly useful if you're traveling on business or to a new place and need to grab a quick bite to eat, and don't have time to wander around aimlessly. From the main search screen, click on the three parallel lines on the left-hand side of the search bar. (Designers call this common icon the "hamburger.") If you're zoomed into a reasonably local area, you should see the "Explore" section, which will direct you to good places to eat, cheap places to eat, nearby attractions and more. - Download an offline area: If you're going to be somewhere where you can't get cell service, take advantage of the ability to download a section of Google Maps to access offline. To do this tap in the search bar and scroll down until you see "Download a new offline area." Alternatively, you can search for a city and swipe up from the bottom, and then hit the "Download" option. Google won't let you download too large of an area - but you can go up to 120,000 square kilometers. You can interact with this offline section of the map and search for directions to locations within that part of the world. Maps won't suggest places for you, but it will still be more useful than an old-school map. You should know that if you download a part of Google Maps, it will take up storage space on your phone. But it can be convenient, and it's way easier to transport than a paper map that you'll never be able to refold again. - Share directions: Need to let someone else know how to get to where they're going? Once you have the directions you need, hit the three-dot options menu and tap "Share Directions." That will let you text or email directions to someone through a link, or even share directions over Twitter or Facebook if you so desire. That's way easier than reading your phone's screen to someone, or trying to remember off the top of your head. Besides, your friends are probably just going to put the destination in Google Maps anyway. This feature can save both of you the trouble. - Sign-in for better service: If you're signed in to Maps it adds quite a bit of functionality - though you're also giving Google's app more access to your information. Deciding whether the trade-off is worth it is up to you. If you sign in and turn on your history, from that point you'll be able to reference your past destinations more quickly. So, if you get a restaurant recommendation for a summer trip and then want to go back the following summer, you should be able to do that quickly. Another advantage to signing in is that you can link your Google Contacts to Google Maps, so it's easy to find your friend Jim's house by pulling it from your address book. That saves you from having to ask "Where am I going, again?" when you get in the car. You can sign in to your Google Account by hitting the hamburger icon and tapping "Sign in." - Know more about what you're getting into: There are also some settings that most users know about but likely don't use that often. On the options menu, for example, you can turn on different filters and features to get different information about where you're headed. If you're walking in a hilly city such as San Francisco, for example, you may really want to see the terrain around you. A coffee shop may look like it's just a quick walk and a few blocks away - but those blocks may take you straight up a steep hill. That's vital information to know if you don't want to be out of breath by the time you get there. One setting I use a lot that many may find useful is the setting preference to "avoid tolls." Of course, you can't always find a toll-free way to get somewhere in the time you need, but it's still nice to have the option on hand.

The Friday Wrap is, my weekly collection of news stories, posts, studies, and reports designed to help organizational communicators stay current on the trends and technology that affect their jobs. These may be items that flew under the radar while other stories grabbed big headlines. As always, I collect material from which I select Wrap stories (as well as stories to report on the For Immediate Release podcast, along with stuff I just want to remember to read) on my link blog, which you’re welcome to follow. If you want to make sure you never miss an edition of the Wrap, along with extra material only for subscribers, sign up for my weekly email briefing. News Facebook’s latest algorithm change demotes clickbait—You know the headlines: “Woman asks husband if dress makes her look fat. You won’t believe what happened next!” Okay, I made that one up, but you’ve seen tons of clickbait in recent years. Facebook’s latest change to its News Feed algorithm is designed to categorize such headlines that “withhold or distort information” as clickbait and allow them to slip through less often. It’s the first time Facebook has targeted clickbait. The takeaway: Facebook is working hard to make the News Feed a more satisfying experience in an effort to retain users. This change, at least, won’t have an effect on brands’ efforts to reach customers. Read more Saatchi’s Roberts resigns—Saatchi & Saatchi Chairman Kevin Roberts, who was already under suspension following tone-deaf comments about gender, has resigned. Parent company Publicis put Roberts on leave after he told an interviewer that the gender debate is over. The takeaway: An IABC study from the late 1970s defined the communications industry as a “velvet ghetto” where women outnumbered men but rarely broke through into management and leadership positions. It’s amazing that this continues to be an issue nearly 40 years later. Read more FTC crackdown on paid celebrity posts is coming—Influencer marketing includes paying celebrities to display their products in their social media channels. The FTC is not amused when those pictures, videos, and posts aren’t clearly labeled as paid ads. Use of hashtags like #ad, #sp, and #sponsored are often inadequate. An FTC spokesperson said, “We believe consumers put stock in endorsements and we want to make sure they are not being deceived.” The takeaway: Disclose, disclose, disclose. Full stop. That goes for native ads, too. Read more Apple replaces pistol emoji with a Super Soaker—Among new emoji Apple is introducing is a replacement for the pistol emoji; it’s now a classic Super Soaker water pistol. The move comes amidst activist pressure to get rid of the gun. The new emoji also include a host of athletes in anticipation of widespread use during the Olympics. The takeaway: The move is another indicator of the move toward social activism among corporations. It also speaks to the widespread adoption of emojis. Read more Google AMP appears in all mobile search results—Google’s mobile web initiative, Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), is designed to make web pages appear quickly on mobile devices wherever they may be (as opposed to Facebook’s Instant Articles, which are also lightning-fast but only work when you’re on Facebook). Google is planning to display AMP links in all mobile search results. They’ll appear accompanied by lightning bolts. Rankings won’t be affected, but as users come to understand an AMP page won’t keep them waiting, they’re likely to click on them most. The takeaway: Talk to your web people about producing AMP versions of content if they’re not already. Read more If you’re not a paying sponsor, steer clear of the Olympics—Newsjacking is great, but the Olympic Committee’s Rule 40 spells trouble for those attempting to leverage it at the Games that are just about to start. Non-sponsor companies have received a letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee warning them not to use Olympics intellectual property, which include obvious properties like logos, but also hashtags. “Do not create social media posts that are Olympic themed, that feature Olympic trademarks, that contain Games imagery or congratulate Olympic performance unless you are an official sponsor,” the letter read. The first response you’ll get if you violate the rules is a demand to remove the content. Legal action could follow. The takeaway: Your desire to ride on the Olympics coattails will be crushed by the negative publicity of a lawsuit. Even having to remove content will draw unwelcome attention. The best advice: Just don’t go there, even though it’s too bad the Committee isn’t just a little flexible in terms of such posts as a congratulations to a home-town athlete.. Read more Database of Millennial opinions available for free—A database of over 130 million Millennial opinions is now available for free searching by anyone who wants insight into what this important demographic is currently thinking on a range of issues. The database is from Whatsgoodly. The takeaway: While too much focus is placed on age demographics, the data here can be invaluable—and did I mention that it’s free? Read more Dropbox opens Paper beta to everyone—Any Dropbox user is now able to give Paper a try via an iOS or Android app. Paper goes head-to-head with Google Docs for online document creation. Designed for mobile, Paper has given rise to more than a million documents from the early beta users. The takeaway: Easy document creation via phones and tablets is increasingly important as part of the mobile shift. Being able to create documents that go straight to a Dropbox folder of your choosing is a great idea. Read more Facebook introduces Page Sections—Marketers, beset by Facebook algorithm changes that make it harder and harder to reach customers, finally have something to cheer about. Facebook has introduced new sections for Company Pages to promote goods and services. Shop is a section available in emerging markets that allows businesses to list products that customers can buy through Messenger. Services, which will be available in all geographies, also lets companies list products and services with prices, a description, and photos. The takeaway: The Messenger connection for actual purchases speaks volumes about Facebook’s commitment to mobile. Facebook recently announced that 1 billion people access the social network via mobile on any given day. Read more New index measures consumer attitudes toward online marketing—The Digital Satisfaction Index is a new tool that lets marketers grasp “how consumers make connections with a brand leading up to their final decision to either engage and purchase or go elsewhere.” The index was developed by Intent Lab, a partnership between the Medill School of Journalism and Performics Worldwide. Intent Labs will conduct original research linked to major brands to help those brands better understand the online behavior of their customers. The index is based on research that identified four key elements of consumer satisfaction: trust, utility, social, and privacy. The takeaway: As a measurement geek, I love the idea of an index targeting digital satisfaction. I’m curious how it’ll correlate to the long-standing reputation index. Read more Trends Podcast marketing gets serious—NPR went far beyond traditional podcast marketing to launch the second season of “Invisibilia.” More than 200 listening parties were held in 32 states and three countries. Videos and other sharable content was produced for social media; one video posted to Facebook got more than 700,000 views. Invisibilia was expected to top the 50 million downloads its first season produced. The takeaway: Podcasting is an increasingly important part of the content mix for media companies. If every company is a media company (as Tom Foremski postulated back in 2009), most companies are falling behind the media curve. Podcasts are hot and will only get hotter. Explore the potential for podcasting in your organization. Read more Marriott taps into Pokeman Go frenzy—Joining a roster of brands that are capitalizing on Pokemon Go’s unprecedented popularity, Marriott is sponsoring one player’s efforts to capture the entire collection of Pokemon. Nick Johnson captured every creature available in the U.S., leading Marriott’s loyalty operation to offer to sponsor his international travel tab in his quest to get the rest. Marriott Rewards and Johnson are chronicling the quest on Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram. The takeaway: This is a smart move by Marriott and a clever way to ride the Pokemon wave without looking like just another me-too brand. The investment is small and the publicity returns are high. Read more Kik’s Bot Shop is paying off—Kik, the mobile messaging app that was among the first to introduce chatbots via its Bot Shop, is seeing growing use among users and businesses. Some 1.8 billion messages have been communicated between users and bots from the 111 featured bots. Research also found the use of bots results in 32% more time spent on the app and that they drive greater completion rates for brands. The takeaway: Bot adoption is surging and will become routine faster than you’re probably anticipating. Read more Organizations learning to use the right tools for the audience—If you want your message to resonate with Millennials, you should communicate with them using the kinds of tools they’re accustomed to using. A pro-fracking website funded by players in the industry is doing just that, using memes, spoof videos, emojis, quizzes, and listicles. Love fracking or hate it, you have to admire this advocacy group for understanding what it takes to get a message through to an audience that won’t sit and read reports and studies on their phones. Read more Price Waterhouse Coopers lists blockchain among essential technologies—PWC studied some 150 emerging technologies for an executive report and settled on eight that are essential for companies to grasp, including blockchain, a technology that will disrupt more than you can imagine yet few communicators understand. The other essential technologies include Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, drones, the Internet of Things, robots, Virtual Reality, and 3D printing. The takeaway: I know I ask you to get up to speed on all kinds of different technologies, but no kidding, blockchain is coming fast and will have a profound impact on every aspect of business. It is, effectively, a new network that runs in parallel to the Internet. If you need a quick start, try “The Blockchain Revolution,” by Dan Tapscott and his son, who works in the blockchain space. I’ll be reviewing it soon for For Immediate Release’s book review podcast. Read more Research Most native ads are done wrong—Native advertising is clearly a savior for publishers and a boon for marketers. The greatest risk to native advertising is a perception that it is inherently deceptive. Current practices suggest that this perception could take root, leading to regulation. A study of native ads appearing on home pages of the top 100 news sites found that 71% didn’t adequately disclose that they were ads. The study identified 43 distinct terms or phrases used to label the ads. While “and” and “paid” are clear enough, others can confuse readers into thinking their looking at editorial content. These include “sponsored by,” “powered by,” “special coverage,” and “recommended for you.” The Online Trust Alliance, which conducted the study, noted that a failure to self-regulate will negatively affect “consumer trust and confidence in online advertising and the brand reputation of sites…poor transparency will backfire, driving calls for regulatory oversight.” The takeaway: It has been two years since Richard Edelman said the PR industry has a small window to become the stewards of native advertising and ensure it’s done right. I fear that window has closed and native ads are headed for government regulation. Read more After-hours email is exhausting—The result of checking work email after-hours and on weekends is burnout, according to a new academic report. It’s not the actual checking of the email that’s so exhausting; it’s the “constant worrying about off hour email.” The study from researchers at three universities, “Exhausted but Unable to Disconnect,” found employees “are growing exhausted by the expectation that they will always be available, never knowing what kind of work requests will be asked of them off hours.” The takeaway: There’s a difference between expecting employees to answer work-related emails when they’re supposed to be on the “life” side of the work-life equation and giving them access to content they may want to consume. Rules about off-hour email should be implemented but shouldn’t restrict off-hour access to the intranet and other company content. Read more Most companies’ customization efforts need work—Brands everywhere are trying to deliver customized products and services, but consumers say marketers “get it right” less than 30% of the time. According to Radius Global Market Research Vice President Shira Horn, the “survey shows that consumers are potentially very receptive to efforts to customize the brand experience. But if marketers don’t do the homework involved to provide and communicate highly relevant benefits to their specific audiences, they are unlikely to capitalize on the opportunity.” The takeaway: I’ve seen it. You have too. “Personalized” ads for things we already bought or have no interest in. When a marketer gets it right, though, it can be gold. Read more Video LinkedIn adds influencer videos—A select group of highly influential LinkedIn users is answering questions in short videos that are being aggregated in a new LinkedIn platform. The group of 500 influencers are using a proprietary app called Record to capture their answers of up to 30 seconds. The takeaway: I was skeptical when I heard about this new feature, but having seen a couple of the questions and the collection of video answers, I’m now a fan. When the program expands, it could be invaluable to have your company’s subject matter experts contributing, just as it’s useful to have them appear in Quora answers. Read more Pinterest introduces native video player—A fully integrated native video player is under development at Pinterest The player, along with personalized video recommendations, will appear in the next few months. Video viewing has grown 60% over the last year on Pinterest. The takeaway: It’s hard to think of a platform that isn’t ripe for video. If Pinterest is part of your communication effort, consider increasing the volume of videos you pin. Read more Marketers to increase social video ads—Most U.S. marketers will spend more on social video ads, with Facebook getting most of the attention. With 70.8% of marketers surveyed planning to invest in social ads and boosting the ads, 65.8% will do it on Facebook. The next most popular platform is YouTube, with only 42.3% planning to spend there. The takeaway: The media model to embrace is PESO—paid, earned, shared, owned. Video advertising is demonstrably effective and worth considering, even for corporate and PR messaging, as the “paid” part of the model. Read more Marketers optimistic about digital video advertising —Forty-two percent of marketers are increasingly optimistic about digital video advertising, with B2B marketers in particular making it an investment priority: 84% plan to grow their video marketing budgets this year and 83% said video ads were effective. Across both B2B and B2C companies, Facebook and Snapchat have overtaken YouTube as the social platform of choice for video ads. The takeaway: The two studies cited in this report just add to the pile of evidence that video marketing works, even as the field gets crowded. Time to brush off your video production skills (if you haven’t already). Read more Media companies pursue TV content—Here’s another media company trend brands aren’t following: Publishers including Vox Media, BuzzFeed, Thrillist Media Group, and Mashable are doing deals to broadcast content on TV. One example: Daily digital magazine Ozy is producing a 16-part program for PBS about an array of political candidates from American history. Vox Entertainment is developing a show for the FYI network about prefabricated homes. BuzzFeed is developing the web show “Mom vs. Chef” for NBCUniversal. The takeaway: With small cable networks hungry for new content and the ability to stream content through apps on services like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV, companies that want to behave like media companies should start exploring the potential for original TV content. Read more Facebook testing mid-roll ads on Live—If you’re live-streaming over Facebook Live, you could find your stream interrupted for 15 seconds for a commercial break as Facebook tests mid-roll video ads as part of the platform. It’s currently a small test with publishers injecting ads into their own streams. CEO Mark Zuckerberg dislikes the idea of pre-rolls; they could ruin the viewing experience, but mid-roll ads, which appear after you’ve been watching for at least five minutes, are more appealing. Some issues still need to be ironed out, such as ads appearing in the middle of coverage of a tragic news event. The takeaway: The live streaming world is maturing in a hurry. With Twitter’s sports deals and the Olympics being consumed mainly on mobile devices, viewership of live streams will only get more common. Read more Lowe’s introduces 360-degree DIY videos—As viewing of 360-degree videos gets more popular, home improvement retailer Lowe’s—already known for being an early adopter of Vine—has introduced a new initiative titled “Made in a Minute” on its Facebook Page. The Facebook 36-degree clips provide viewers with step-by-step instructions on home improvement projects. The takeaway: 360-degree videos is another innovation that costs basically nothing to start using. Watch the videos for an idea of how Lowe’s has applied them to its marketing efforts and dream up some inspiration for your company or client. Read more Instagram Stories Instagram adds Snapchat-like Stories feature—The new Instagram section offers photos and videos from users that vanish after 24 hours, just like Snapchat Stories. Instagram’s version appears across the top of your feed “as a series of circles with the avatars of people and brands you follow. When you tap on a Story, it loads, begins playing, and advances from moment to moment automatically…When you finish one person’s Story, the app automatically advances to the next person or brand, and so on.” The takeaway: The collective eye-rolling over a clear copying of Snapchat Stories misses the point. After all, if brands didn’t copy best-in-class innovation, Tide would still the only marketer of laundry pods. The point here is that Instagram has done a better job of implementing the feature that will be used by a lot more people. Read more Stories is better on Instagram than on Snapchat—While the accusations of copycatting are rampant, TNW argues that the experience is better on Instagram. While Snapchat’s interface confounds many adults, Instagram’s approach is “useful to the masses> It also has desirable features that reduce confusion, with labeled buttons instead of swipes. The takeaway: There’s no cost for a brand to start publishing Instagram Stories. Even if you’re already fully immersed in Snapchat, Instagram’s much larger base is a desirable target. As the TNW piece notes, “It’s liberating to be able to see the stories of people I’ve never met but followed on Instagram for years.” At the very least, duplicate your Snapchat efforts on Instagram. Read more Marketers prefer Instagram Stories to Snapchat—It may be brand-spanking new and the subject of considerable derision on line as being just a Snapchat copycat, but marketers seem to like Instagram’s new Stories feature. Nike saw 800,000 views in the first day it used Instagram Stories; the best performance Nike has seen on Snapchat has been 66,000 views for a video. Marketers also like the feedback Instagram provides via its heart icon (the equivalent of a like); there is no way to like a Snap. Instagram also allows marketers to restrict viewing to people over 21, important to alcohol brands. And there are simply more people on Instagram. The takeaway: So it’s a copycat move. So what? Snapchat is going to have to move quickly to adopt features that make Instagram preferable, especially a like feature that offers some quantitative feedback to marketers. Snapchat is already under some fire for inadequate marketing metrics. Read more Mobile and Wearables Most Olympics viewing will happen on phones and tablets—The Summer Olympics are upon us and research finds that most people will use their smartphones and tablets as their “first screen” for watching the competitions. The reason? They can watch events in real time rather than wait for the recordings broadcast over television. The takeaway: If you’re waiting for a good reason to start broadcasting some brand or corporate content, consider the consumer desire for more control over the content they want. Rather than wait for your YouTube or Facebook video to be uploaded, a growing number of people are looking to see it live and know they can do that wherever they are on their mobile devices. Read more Most companies don’t have a long-term mobile strategy—Everyone knows how important mobile marketing is becoming, yet 80% of brands don’t have a mobile marketing strategy that covers the next year, according to an Adobe survey of 4,000 marketers and digital decision makers. The takeaway: If your organization is part of the 80%, suggest a strategic planning session. Strategies always produce better results than flying by the seat of your pants.

REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File PhotoMore By Paul Lienert and David Shepardson (Reuters) - Chris Urmson, who was instrumental in building Google's self-driving car project, said on Friday he is leaving the team after seven and a half years. Alphabet Inc's Google had named Urmson chief technical officer of the project after it hired former Hyundai executive John Krafcik to be chief executive of the project. Urmson, who joined the project when it was launched and has been a public face of Google's autonomous vehicle efforts, testified before a U.S. Senate panel on autonomous cars in March. Krafcik confirmed Urmson's departure in a tweet on Friday afternoon. Urmson, in a blog post late Friday, said he was "ready for a fresh challenge." He said he was not sure what he would do next. "Going to take some time and get some perspective from outside of Google," he wrote in a text message to Reuters. Urmson told Reuters earlier this year that self-driving cars are coming. "I’ve gone from hoping this would happen to thinking it might happen to knowing it will happen,” Urmson said. Google self-driving car project spokesman Johnny Luu confirmed Urmson's departure and praised him. "Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this life-saving technology will soon become a reality," Luu said. Google's project has had other significant departures, even as it has hired dozens of new employees. Earlier this year, Anthony Levandowski, who was product manager for Google's self-driving car program, left the project to co-found a startup with two other former Google employees. Google's self-driving car project is expected to become a standalone company this year. In July, the project appointed its first general counsel. Google has logged more than 1.8 million miles of autonomous driving in testing in Texas, California, Arizona and Washington state. It has said it has no timetable for making self-driving vehicles available to the public. Officials have said Google is preparing to make its self-driving car unit a separate company. The program is now part of its X research laboratory unit. "The self-driving car project is in the middle of graduating from X and this is sort of a gradual process," Astro Teller, who heads the X program, told NBC News in April. In May, Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said they had agreed to work together to build a fleet of nearly 100 self-driving minivans, the first time a Silicon Valley firm had teamed up with a traditional carmaker to develop an autonomous vehicle. In March, Reuters reported Google's self-driving car team was expanding and hiring more people with automotive industry expertise, underscoring the company's determination to move the division past the experimental stage.

He was said to be unhappy with the project’s leadership. Credit Drew Angerer/Bloomberg SAN FRANCISCO — A roboticist and crucial member of the team that created Google’s self-driving car is leaving the company, the latest in a string of departures by important technologists working on the autonomous car project. Chris Urmson, a Carnegie Mellon University research scientist, joined Google in 2009 to help create the then-secret effort. He took over leadership of the team after Sebastian Thrun, the Stanford computer scientist and founder of Google X laboratory, left in 2013. Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Alphabet, the parent company of X, the company’s research division that oversees the car project, confirmed Mr. Urmson was planning to leave. “Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this lifesaving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes,” Mr. Luu wrote in an email message. The departures come after Google’s decision last year to hire John Krafcik, the former president and chief executive of Hyundai America, to be chief of the car project, as part of a plan to spin the effort out as a stand-alone company under the Alphabet umbrella. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The X research group, often called Google’s “moonshot” division, is under increasing pressure to show that at some point the company can expect a financial windfall from its projects. Google’s self-driving car project has been a pioneer in autonomous vehicle technology, but a commercial version of the car is still likely to be several years away. Mr. Urmson has been unhappy with the direction of the car project under Mr. Krafcik’s leadership and quarreled privately several months ago with Larry Page over where it was headed, according to two former Google employees. A spokesman for Google declined to comment on those discussions, but Mr. Urmson disputed they were a reason for his departure. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times After the dispute, Mr. Urmson decided to take the summer off and only recently decided to leave the company. He told members of the self-driving car team about his decision on Thursday, the former employees said. In a post published on Medium Friday afternoon, Mr. Urmson said he had not decided what he will do next. “If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky,” he wrote. “I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands.” As a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Urmson was a member of a team of engineers that placed second in the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge contest for autonomous vehicles that was won by a rival team from Stanford, led by Mr. Thrun. In 2007, Carnegie Mellon got revenge when it placed first in the Darpa Urban Challenge, while the Stanford team finished second. Earlier this year, a group of Google employees, led by Anthony Levandowski, former Google Car engineer, and Lior Ron, the product lead for Google Maps, left to found the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which is based in San Francisco. More recently, two other Google car engineers, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, who are considered experts on so-called machine vision technology, left to found an as-yet-unannounced start-up, according to the two people with knowledge of the Google car project.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Best Navigation Apps For Android By Ankush Das on 08/05/2016 15:16 PST Heading out to a new location? Ever lost your way? Navigation apps to the rescue. The navigation apps help us find our way, share our location, get access to traffic details and more, but there are many options that are tailored to specific needs There are a great many navigation apps available on the Play Store, but after taking a good look, we are to propose what we deem to be the best navigation apps for Android. 1. Google Maps It is an obvious choice. Without a doubt, it is the best overall navigation app for Android. Recently, Google has added the ability to download offline areas (which was there in a less official form before), which is useful if you are heading to an area with poor connectivity. Google Maps should also be preferred when traveling to the countryside. Google updates the information regularly and provides extensive details. Pros Detailed & Vast Information Suitable for any location worldwide Cycle routes present Cons Offline maps expire within 15-days No Real-time Community reports Download: 2. Waze Waze maps is a community-driven application which focuses on providing real-time traffic information. As a “Wazer” (community member) you can report accidents, traffic jams, and similar incidents on the way. Friends can see each other’s E.T.A when driving to the same place as well. Apart from this, it also delivers a unique user experience. Waze may seem to take a more complicated route sometimes, but it knows how to avoid the traffic. Pros Shorter drive Better real-time traffic information Add friends to keep up with the time while traveling to the same place Cons No offline maps Lack of details (varies with location) Download: 3. Here WeGo It one of the simplest navigation apps for Android. Recently, Here Maps rebranded to – “Here We Go”. It has been tailored for offline use. In addition, it lets you download the map of an entire country. Unlike Google Maps, it does not offer an expiration period for the offline maps. It also provides a quick-action button to search for Nearby places. It offers information on routes for the users who like to travel through their bikes. The new update also gives you additional information like taxi fares and ticket prices (limited to locations). It is one the best alternatives to Google Maps. Pros Best for offline use Cons User Interface could look better Download: 4. Sygic When starting upon, it asks you to choose the installation path (SD Card or Internal Storage). In order to get started, you will have to download an entire country. Unless you download the map for offline use, you would not be able to use Sygic. This one utilizes TomTom’s 3D navigation maps, giving a better user experience. It also offers the ability to project navigation on the car’s windshield at night. Pros Fast Resource-friendly Cons Project navigation works on specific countries Will not work unless you download the required map data Download: 5. MAPS.ME An impressive navigation app providing detailed information. It offers an interesting ability to edit the map directly from MAPS.ME. You can import/export bookmarks (marked locations) as well. Recently, it has added support for a travel plan to Rio 2016 Olympics which includes – Olympic venues / stadiums, information about the press, and other must-sees. The user interface is pretty basic and it works smooth even on a low-end device with a slower Internet connection. Pros Smooth & Fast Cons Lack of information (Worldwide) Download: 6. MapFactor MapFactor is a popular navigation app that comes with an outdated user interface. It is useful when you are in need of turn-by-turn navigation. It also gives you an option (through in-app purchase) to utilize TomTom navigation maps. Pros Fast & Light Cons Outdated User Interface Download: 7. Polaris navigation Polaris navigation utilizes Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Cycle Route Maps and MapQuest Maps to deliver an all-in-one experience. It offers an option to record trail. This helps you keep track of the path you have traveled. It provides important details which include – magnetic heading, true heading, altitude, latitude, and longitude. It also comes with a compass which can be used for the directions. Although, it contains in-app advertisements. You can upgrade to its pro version – GPS Waypoints navigator (at 10 USD), which offers more features without in-app advertisements. Pros Geeky details Fast & Light Cons UI could be better Pricey pro version Download: 8. Maps & Navigation — OsmAnd OsmAnd is a free navigation app that relies on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. It works offline as well. It offers day and night view switching. Interestingly, you would also get access to some footpaths route data. It lets you directly contribute / report to OSM. Pros Footpath data Trip recording Cons Lack of information (worldwide) Download: These are some of the best navigation apps for Android that we would want you to look out for.

For those of you who are super observant, you may have noticed some changes on my blog over the last few months. Tumblr posts went away. Fiction Groupie disappeared. I deleted most of my Pinterest boards. The Boyfriend of the Week has changed format. And all my previous posts from the past three years -- all 700 of them -- now have new photos on them. Image: Ginnerobot via Flickr. Why is that? What happened? Well, you've probably figured it out from the title, but it's because I've been involved in a case regarding a photo I used on my blog. Like most of you, I'm a casual blogger and learned my way into blogging by watching others. And one of the things I learned early on was that a post with a photo always looked nicer than one with just text. So I looked at what other people were doing for pictures. And mostly it seemed that everyone was grabbing pics from Google Images and pasting them on their sites. Sometimes with attribution, most of the time without. And when I asked others (or looked at disclaimers on websites and Tumblrs), it seemed that everyone agreed using pics that way was okay under Fair Use standards. Here is an example of a disclaimer I found on a bigger site (name of blog removed): THIS BLOG claims no credit for any images posted on this site unless otherwise noted. Images on this blog are copyright to its respectful owners. If there is an image appearing on this blog that belongs to you and do not wish for it appear on this site, please E-mail with a link to said image and it will be promptly removed. And site after site had the same kind of thing. Just look on Tumblr, that same type of disclaimer is on a ton of them. And I'm thinking -- well, that must mean it's okay because if that weren't true, sites like Tumblr and Pinterest couldn't even exist because reposting pics is the whole POINT of those sites. So off I went doing what everyone else does -- using pics from Google Images, putting a disclaimer on my site, etc. Well on one random post, I grabbed one random picture off of Google and then a few weeks later I got contacted by the photographer who owned that photo. He sent me a takedown notice, which I responded to immediately because I felt awful that I had unknowingly used a copyrighted pic. The pic was down within minutes. But that wasn't going to cut it. He wanted compensation for the pic. A significant chunk of money that I couldn't afford. I'm not going to go into the details but know that it was a lot of stress, lawyers had to get involved, and I had to pay money that I didn't have for a use of a photo I didn't need. It wasn't fun. But the fact of the matter is, I was in the wrong. Unknowingly. But that doesn't matter. And my guess is that many, many of you are doing the same thing I was doing without realizing it's a copyright violation. So I wanted to share my experience so that you can learn from my mistake. Here's what I learned about Fair Use: It doesn't matter... if you link back to the source and list the photographer's name if the picture is not full-sized if you did it innocently if your site is non-commercial and you made no money from the use of the photo if you didn't claim the photo was yours if you've added commentary in addition to having the pic in the post if the picture is embedded and not saved on your server if you have a disclaimer on your site if you immediately take down a pic if someone sends you a DMCA notice (you do have to take it down, but it doesn't absolve you.) NONE OF THAT releases you from liability. You are violating copyright if you have not gotten express PERMISSION from the copyright holder OR are using pics that are public domain, creative commons, etc. (more on that below.) I didn't know better, and I had to learn the hard way. So I want to let you all know now so that you don't have to be a cautionary tale as well. Plus, beyond not wanting to be sued, most of you who are reading this are writers. Our livelihood depends on the rights to our work. I've already had to send my own DMCAs to sites that have pirated my books. So I definitely don't want to be someone who infringes on someone else's copyright. A photo is someone else's art and unless they tell me it's okay, I don't have the right to use it. So what can you do? 1. If you've been using images without approval from the Internet on your blogs, know that you are probably violating copyright and could be sued for it. Is the chance high? Probably not. Is it possible? I'm proof that it is. So you may want to consider going through your posts and delete pics that aren't yours. 2. Search for photos that are approved for use. Creative Commons-licensed pics -- You can search for photos that are free to use (with some restrictions) through Creative Commons. Usually this means you have to attribute the photo to the owner and link back to their site. (All of my posts now have pics that are under Creative Commons license. And there are actually really great photos available.) Meghan Ward did a fantastic post on the breakdown of Creative Commons licenses plus listed some other photo sources.) Wikimedia Commons offers free media files anyone can use. (Creative Commons license rules still apply if they attached to an image; however, many images on Wikimedia Commons are in the public domain and therefore copyright-free, meaning anyone can use and modify them for any purpose. You need to look at the description for each image and abide by those rules. Buy a subscription to a stock photo site -- This can be pricey up front but then you have access all year. There are also sites that you can pay per pic. (Here is one example of a subscription service. Thanks to Janice Hardy for that suggestion.) Use photos that are in the public domain; as above, Wikimedia Commons is a great place to start. Here's another list put together by the editors at Wikipedia. 3. Take your own photos and share the love. Almost all of us have camera phones these days. Instead of just taking photos of our family, think of images you could use on posts. See a stop sign. Snap a picture and save it. Whatever. And if you want to give back and not just take, open up a Flickr account (here's mine) and list your own images as creative commons so that you can share the love. (You can set it up to where whatever pic you load from you camera is under that license.) 4. Use sites like Pinterest and Tumblr with caution. I have read way too many terms of service over the last two months. And I'm not a lawyer, so the legalspeak can be confusing, and I am NOT giving legal advice. BUT both Pinterest and Tumblr (and most other social sites) say that if you load something into their site (i.e. Pin It or Tumble it) YOU are claiming that YOU have a legal right to that picture. And if the owner of that photo comes after the company, you will be the responsible party. Yes, if that's enforced, it would seem to mean that 99% of people on Pinterest are doing something illegal. Will that ever come up? Maybe. Maybe not. But I'm leaning on the paranoid side now. I don't want to be the test case. And I don't want to pin something the owner of the photo wouldn't want pinned. So pin your own photos, pin things from sites that have a Pin It button (but use the Pin It button with caution too. If that blogger is using pics they don't own the copyright for, you still don't have the right to pin without permission of the copyright owner.) I pin book covers and movie posters because I figure that it's advertisement for said movies or books. But other stuff? All those pretty mancandy photos? I'm going to look but not touch. This would also apply sharing pics on Facebook. Same rules apply. And it should go without saying at this point: NEVER use Pinterest or Tumblr or Facebook or Twitter as a source for images to use on your own blog, unless you've asked for permission. 5. Assume that something is copyrighted until proven otherwise. That's your safest bet. If you're not 100% sure it's okay to use, don't. This includes things like celebrity photos. Someone owns those. There are enough free pics out there that you don't need to risk violating someone's copyright. 6. Spread the word to your fellow bloggers. It was KILLING me not to be able to go tell everyone about all of this because I didn't want anyone else to get into this kind of mess. So if you know someone who is using photos in the wrong way, let them know. I wish someone had told me. So I know many of you are probably thinking -- she's being paranoid or that the likelihood of this ever happening to you is slim. Well, maybe. But it happened to me. And now that I know better, I'm going to do better (from the Maya Angelou quote Oprah always used.) And yes, it does kill me a little bit that I can't go on posting boyfriends of the week and mancandy, but instead I'll just post links to it so you can see it elsewhere. :) So lesson learned: protect yourself and respect the rights of other artists. *This post is not intended as legal advice. God knows I have no background in law. This is just my experience and what I learned working these past few weeks with people who are experts at copyright. So what are your thoughts? Anyone surprised by this? Anyone have any other recommendations on where to find approved photos?

An interesting contrast to the last two opening ceremonies. The theme of Beijing 2008 was China is great, London 2012’s was Britain WAS great. Tonight’s theme? We better start doing something about the environment or we may not have many Olympics to celebrate in the future.

What a sight. The flame itself is encased in a beautiful swirling sculpture that I thought was CGI when I first saw it. The cauldron is lit at the Maracanã. Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images Updated at 11.00pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.54pm EDT 22:54 A note on the flame from the organisers: The Brazilian cauldron breaks with a tradition of cauldrons that produce a large volume of fire. This cauldron is intentionally small and low emission. Symbolically the small flame answers the call to reduce warming caused by polluting gases. With what we know today, it is no longer possible to burn tons of gas and consider it beautiful. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.53pm EDT 22:53 Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima lights the flame And in Pele’s absence, Gustavo Kuerten, the three-time French Open champion and tennis great, enters the stadium with the Olympic flame. “Guga!” the crowd cheer in his honor. But it’s won’t be Guga who lights the flame instead it will be Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima, who was leading the 2004 Olympic marathon when he was tackled to the ground by a spectator. He missed out on gold that day but he has his moment at his home Olympics in 2016.

According to the organizers: The choice of Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Anita, not traditional Samba interpreters, to sing aclassic samba song is the expression of our desire to show that Brazilian music as well as the country itself and even the whole world, would profit from mixing differences without prejudice, with a spirit of inclusion and above all celebrating happiness.

He is awarded the honor for his charity work with children in Kenya. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.21pm EDT 22:21 Thomas Bach, IOC president, praises refugee athletes The IOC president, Thomas Bach, speaks now. He starts off with a greeting in Portuguese. You can almost see him smiling a jaunty smile to himself and thinking “Sepp Blatter didn’t get this good a reception at the World Cup”. He acknowledges it is a difficult time in Brazilian history but says “we have always believed in you”. He then says we “are living in a world of mistrust, fear and crisis”. This escalated quickly. He says the answer is the athletes before us - a lot of pressure on the caterers here - “sharing their meals and emotions”. Sure, that and a legally binding carbon emission agreement. He says we leave in a world where “selfishness” is gaining ground and then goes on to welcome the refugee team. I wonder if that was directed at anyone in particular? “You had to flee your homes ... now with you human spirit you are making a great contribution to society. In this Olympic world ... we welcome you as an enrichment of our unity in diversity.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.11pm EDT 22:11 Carlos Nuzman, the head of the Rio 2016 committee, speaks. He welcomes the world to Rio and describes himself as “the proudest man alive” to be hosting the Games in his city. A particularly big cheer from the crowd as he says these are the first Olympics in South America. He thanks the government, which elicits some boos from the spectators. He brings it back by saying “we [Brazil] never give up”. Nuzman concludes by going off topic to reveal what happens at the end of Game of Thrones, which was a little surprising.

Oh, yes, here’s the Brazil team. Unsurprisingly, few of the Brazil athletes have decided to skip the opening ceremony on home soil. The noise rises in the stadium, as do the Brazilian flags.

Apparently on his own: “One great advantage to the opening ceremonies is that streets which are normally packed are instead empty. On some usually-crowded avenues you can walk across six lanes of traffic in the middle of the street. I don’t know if people are home watching or have decided to stay away from areas near Olympic venues. Either way it is very quiet in parts of Rio.” Updated at 9.38pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.31pm EDT 21:31 Owen Gibson The Russians, clad in bow ties, may not have been here if the International Olympic Committee had followed the advice of Wada, many national governments and 13 major international anti-doping organisations. Instead, a large contingent marched out into the Maracana to be greeted by muted cheers and the odd boo. Today, more Russian athletes were re-admitted under the chaotic and convoluted process, including swimmer Yuliya Efimova, after the Court of Arbitration for Sport decided that those who had previously served bans could not be arbitrarily kept out. According to state news agency TASS, the total number now stands at 279. Will be fascinating to see how they are received in the venues, particularly if they win a medal. Sergey Tetyukhin leads out the Russian contingent to a comparatively muted welcome.

Let’s call it polite. Almost all of their track and field athletes have been left back in Russia after the doping scandal (some of those who train outside their homeland have been allowed to compete.)

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.06pm EDT 21:06 There’s a fascinating story behind Iran’s flagbearer. Here’s the AP take: Archer Zahra Nemati had a big smile and a wave for the crowd as she carried Iran’s flag into the opening ceremony in her wheelchair. Nemati is competing at the Olympics and Paralympics, where she’s a defending gold medalist. She was a black belt in taekwondo before she was paralyzed as a teenager. She picked up archery a few years later because she wanted to compete in a sport. Earlier Friday, she competed in archery’s qualifying round at the Sambadrome. She shot 72 arrows and accumulated a score of 609 — good enough for 49th position. She’s competing to “make my family and the people around me happy, and let them know I’m OK and I’m strong.” Updated at 9.07pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.00pm EDT 21:00 Here come Laos.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.52pm EDT 20:52 Les Carpenter is out and about in Rio: Outdoor cafes near Copacabana Beach are packed and not just with tourists. Many are locals. All the cafes have televisions and people are watching the parade of countries intently. Those delegations who wave Brazilian flags get the biggest ovation. This is why China inexplicably got a huge roar in all the cafes when they came into the stadium holding Brazil flags. Far bigger roar in the Copacabana cafes for Great Britain than the US. There was a small pack of British fans holding a flag but most of the others appeared to be locals. The US was met with indifference from most here. A small handful cheered but the rest watched silently. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.48pm EDT 20:48 Owen Gibson is at the stadium: Noticeable that Michael Temer, the Brazilian interim president, was not announced to the crowd as billed in the pre-ceremony publicity. Globo reported that he had asked not to be referred to in a bid to avoid getting booed. Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee president who will later give a speech and is under huge pressure for his handling of the Russian doping crisis, received only tepid applause. One other thing: also interesting that athlete’s delegations are noticeably smaller than in previous years. The spread out nature of the Games, with the Olympic Park a long way from the Maracana, means that many athletes felt unable to take part because their competition starts within the next 48 hours. For Team GB, there are only expected to be around 60 athletes marching out of a 366 strong team, for example. Those still at the holding camp in Belo Horizonte or watching from the Olympic Village or British House, near the Lagoa rowing venue, have dressed up in their team outfits regardless.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.17pm EDT 20:17 Bryan Graham is in the stadium: Apparently the start of the parade of nations is the designated bathroom break for many of the hometown ticket holders, who are making beelines to the aisles to empty out, buy a Skol (R$13 on the concourse or US$4) and sneak a cheeky cig. A massive reaction for Argentina as they emerge from the tunnel. Boos? Cheers? Hard to say from the cheap seats. But certainly the biggest pop of the night so far. “I look at everything around me,” a São Paolo-based reporter says with tempered excitement. “I just wish for no disaster.

In an update to the new Android Wear app, Google has revealed that it’s shutting down Together on September 30. Google explains the shutdown by saying that Android Wear 2.0 has many of Together’s integrated into the platform. With features like more interactive watch faces, Google feels that Together is no longer necessary in Android Wear 2.0. If you’re thinking, “Together? What’s that?”, you’re probably not alone. Together is an Android Wear watch face that lets you connect with someone and send them sketches, emojis, and more. The feature is sort of like the Digital Touch feature on the Apple Watch. This news is kind of a bummer, because while maybe not everyone used Together or even knew it existed, there are likely some Android Wear people out there that do use Together. Google feels that the features in Android Wear 2.0 replicate Together’s features well enough to eliminate it, though, so maybe those folks that currently use Together will find similar functionality with that update.

He was said to be unhappy with the project’s leadership. Credit Drew Angerer/Bloomberg SAN FRANCISCO — A roboticist and crucial member of the team that created Google’s self-driving car is leaving the company, the latest in a string of departures by important technologists working on the autonomous car project. Chris Urmson, a Carnegie Mellon University research scientist, joined Google in 2009 to help create the then-secret effort. He took over leadership of the team after Sebastian Thrun, the Stanford computer scientist and founder of Google X laboratory, left in 2013. Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Alphabet, the parent company of X, the company’s research division that oversees the car project, confirmed Mr. Urmson was planning to leave. “Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this lifesaving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes,” Mr. Luu wrote in an email message. The departures come after Google’s decision last year to hire John Krafcik, the former president and chief executive of Hyundai America, to be chief of the car project, as part of a plan to spin the effort out as a stand-alone company under the Alphabet umbrella. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The X research group, often called Google’s “moonshot” division, is under increasing pressure to show that at some point the company can expect a financial windfall from its projects. Google’s self-driving car project has been a pioneer in autonomous vehicle technology, but a commercial version of the car is still likely to be several years away. Mr. Urmson has been unhappy with the direction of the car project under Mr. Krafcik’s leadership and quarreled privately several months ago with Larry Page over where it was headed, according to two former Google employees. A spokesman for Google declined to comment on those discussions, but Mr. Urmson disputed they were a reason for his departure. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times After the dispute, Mr. Urmson decided to take the summer off and only recently decided to leave the company. He told members of the self-driving car team about his decision on Thursday, the former employees said. In a post published on Medium Friday afternoon, Mr. Urmson said he had not decided what he will do next. “If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky,” he wrote. “I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands.” As a researcher at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Urmson was a member of a team of engineers that placed second in the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge contest for autonomous vehicles that was won by a rival team from Stanford, led by Mr. Thrun. In 2007, Carnegie Mellon got revenge when it placed first in the Darpa Urban Challenge, while the Stanford team finished second. Earlier this year, a group of Google employees, led by Anthony Levandowski, former Google Car engineer, and Lior Ron, the product lead for Google Maps, left to found the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which is based in San Francisco. More recently, two other Google car engineers, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, who are considered experts on so-called machine vision technology, left to found an as-yet-unannounced start-up, according to the two people with knowledge of the Google car project.

And it's doing it without months of excessive hype. 1.6k Shares Share 1.5k Tweet 0 Share 3 Share Email Print Share Photo: Netflix and Columbia Pictures On July 15, two '80s throwbacks arrived in the pop-cultural marketplace at the exact same moment. One was a female-centric, theatrical reboot of Ghostbusters, the comedy that owned the box office during the summer of 1984. The other was Stranger Things, a Netflix series set in 1983 and reflective of the sort of sci-fi/supernaturally themed films that often dominated the box office in the same decade.  If people had been asked ahead of time to guess which project would still be generating robust online conversation three weeks later, I suspect most would have pointed at Ghostbusters, which was the focus of months of hype and media conversation, a lot of which, unfortunately, focused on unjustified, misogynistic fanboy backlash to the film. But instead, here we are watching as Stranger Things — a series that was promoted in advance, but much more quietly — continues to ride a wave of pop-culture currency, while Ghostbusters has done what so many major studio movies do these days: faded from public consciousness while other big, heavily hyped tentpole hopefuls — Star Trek: Beyond, Jason Bourne, and now Suicide Squad — take its place. Not only is Stranger Things made in the spirit of movies from three decades ago, its success is reminiscent of those older movies, too. Without firehosing the public in an endless gush of advance publicity, it has managed to generate positive word-of-mouth and establish something that often eludes mainstream Hollywood films: staying power. It is, admittedly, both unfair and downright impossible to compare the success of Stranger Things to Ghostbusters, or any other movie, for that matter, in quantitative terms. We know, for example, that the Paul Feig–directed slime-comedy came in seventh at the North American box office last weekend and, to date, has earned $162.5 million worldwide. But we have no comparable information on Stranger Things because (a) Netflix subscribers don’t pay separately to watch each original program, and (b) Netflix does not release data regarding its viewership. What we do know is that Stranger Things has been an extremely popular subject online and on social media since its July 15 debut, and that popularity does not seem to be waning much. A look at worldwide Google Trends in arts and entertainment over the past 30 days shows that Stranger Things is the second-most-popular search topic and the most-popular search query in that category among those using the search engine. Zeroing in on Stranger Things as a search query reveals that multiple other related queries — particularly those involving Millie Bobby Brown and her character in Stranger Things, Eleven — are having what Google calls "breakout" moments, which means interest in them is surging, at least partly because they have rarely been sought out before. The regions expressing their Google obsession with Stranger Things are varied, too; they include Ireland, the U.S. and Canada, but also Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, home of your 2016 Olympics. By contrast, the Ghostbusters 2016 search query ranks ninth in overall arts and entertainment search queries over the past 30 days, and is popular in far fewer regions. A representative for Twitter said Stranger Things has generated 2.1 million tweets since July 14; as this Twitter-provided chart indicates, it hit its tweet-per-minute peak — 350 every 60 seconds — on July 30, more than two weeks after its premiere. (I requested similar data from Twitter on Ghostbusters but did not receive it prior to publication. Once I receive that information, I'll update this piece. Update: According to Twitter, 1.3 million tweets that featured the word Ghostbusters -- not counting tweets that mentioned its stars or other related keywords -- were issued during the same time period.) All of this is purely anecdotal, extremely non-scientific evidence of a broader, harder-to-define feeling that one gets from lurking around in online spaces: that more people are still actively geeking out about Stranger Things than they are about Ghostbusters. I note all this not to make the point that Ghostbusters is “worse” than Stranger Things. Frankly, I would be very happy if moviegoers collectively turned their backs on Suicide Squad this weekend and went to see Kate McKinnon bust spontaneous moves to the sounds of El DeBarge instead. But because both of these releases have roots in '80s nostalgia and became available for public consumption at the same time, together they make a compelling point: that there’s something to be said for not overhyping films or TV shows to the exhausting extremes that have become routine in recent years. In the '80s — the golden age of the summer blockbuster and an era with which Stranger Things and its creators, the Duffer brothers, are clearly enamored — summers were largely defined by a single movie. In the summer of 1982, E.T., a huge influence on Stranger Things, was No. 1 at the box office for ten weeks and continued to hold that spot for several weeks in September and October. In the summer of 1984, Ghostbusters was No. 1 for eight weeks; the following year, in 1985, Back to the Future was the top movie in North America for all of July (minus one week when European Vacation knocked it into second place), all of August, and most of September. All of these films were major studio productions and were certainly widely publicized. But because internet culture did not yet exist and demand it, there was no need to hype them excessively for months, or even years, on end. No one was screaming about the release dates for these movies two years ahead of time, as is commonplace these days. There were no first-look photos or early trailers that got dissected to death four months before the Bill Murray Ghostbusters came out. There was no online attempt to weigh in on the quality of Michael J. Fox’s Back to Future jean jacket, as seen in leaked photos from the set, because there was no online. These movies just showed up with a bit of hype right before they opened, and most of the time, we had no idea what to expect from them until our asses hit our movie seats. Because theaters were so packed, I didn’t even get to see E.T. until early August, almost two months after it was released, and I still didn’t know what that wrinkled alien looked like until I saw him for the first time on a big screen because Universal didn’t use full-body images of him in its posters or commercials. Today, we not only see the new Ghostbusters’ ensembles and gaze upon Jared Leto in his Joker makeup way ahead of time, we are bombarded with those images for months and months until they destroy all sense of surprise and/or kill whatever was left of our Jordan Catalano–related fantasies. And perhaps as a result, while opening weekends for certain movies break records, very few dominate the box office for more than a week or two. (Finding Dory this summer was a notable exception.) Stranger Things certainly started generating social-media conversations once critics saw it, and Netflix did not shy away from promoting it. But relatively speaking, for this day and age, it remained an unknown entity until its fully formed, creepy yet warmly Winona-stalgic world dropped onto Netflix. That may not explain what made it such an enjoyable, binge-watchable show — Mo Ryan did a pretty solid job of explaining that in this piece for Variety — but it does tell us a little something about what may have helped endear it to fans. In the age of overhyped everything — from tentpole movies to second seasons of HBO series — there is something satisfying about finding a piece of pop culture that’s intended for mainstream consumption but somehow hasn’t been discovered yet.  Our culture and certainly our media outlets, including this one, are super-thirsty at all times for information. Studios, creators, and marketers of films and TV shows are constantly figuring out how to feed the beast in a way that keeps their projects at the front of consumers’ minds (see my colleague Josef Adalian's piece on networks' new Always Be Marketing mentality for more on this). Stranger Things is not subject to the kind of financial pressures faced by a movie with a $100 million-plus budget; had it been released as a film, I suspect it would have been overlooked because bigger movies with bigger budgets would have stolen attention — and, more practically, auditoriums in multiplexes — away from it.  A lot of people will remember the summer of 2016 as the one that introduced them to Stranger Things, a show that exists largely because of movies that won over huge swaths of American moviegoers three decades ago. A year or two from now, when you ask those same people to name the film they most associate with this summer, some of them will say Finding Dory, some will probably hem and haw (“Wait, did The Force Awakens come out in the summer? No, that was Christmas.”), and some will try their best to recall and come up empty, because all their minds can conjure is one massive, overhyped, comic-book-inspired blur.  Tags:stranger thingsghostbustershypeclose reads Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Most Watched on Vulture Top Stories Fantastic Beasts Filmmakers Weigh In on Who Should Play Young Dumbledore Albert Tsai on Dr. Ken and His Very Busy Sitcom Career The Twist in Arrival Is More Than Just a Surprise Ending Most Viewed Stories Ellen DeGeneres Sheds the Final Tears of the Republic As Obama Awards Her the Presidential Medal of Freedom 11.7k Shares Share Tweet Twitter Does What You Did Last Year, Deletes Tila Tequila 948 Shares Share Tweet In Praise of Paris Geller and Her Anger 3.2k Shares Share Tweet Alec Baldwin Replies to Donald Trump’s Anti-SNL Tweet: ‘Election Is Over’ 77.2k Shares Share Tweet Jon Stewart Has a Long History With Anthony Weiner and 11 Other Things We Learned From The Daily Show Book 112 Shares Share Tweet What to Stream Now See what’s new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Grant Morrison Unveils His Jesus-Conan Mash-up Comic, Savage Sword of Jesus Christ 4.1k Shares Share Tweet The Gilmore Girls Cast Power Ranking 134 Shares Share Tweet Gilmore Girls Cast Helps Jimmy Fallon Speculate About the Famous Last 4 Words 309 Shares Share Tweet This Is Us Recap: Thanksgiving Dad Is a Hot Dad 27 Shares Share Tweet Watch Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield, and Liam Neeson in Trailer for Martin Scorsese’s Silence 306 Shares Share Tweet Latest News from Vulture 12:09 p.m.Here, Take This: John Waters Is the Trump Antidote You Need Right Now Bathe yourself in the filthy, muddy Waters. 12:02 p.m.No One, Elton John Included, Wants to Perform at Donald Trump’s Inauguration Not happening. 11:57 a.m.Iconic London Nightclub Fabric Set to Reopen Soon [Updated] The club lost its license in a controversial decision earlier this year. 11:49 a.m.Chris Evans Asks Why Trump Denounces Hamilton and SNL, But Not Racists Turns out, Captain America: not a big fan of white nationalism. 11:29 a.m.Chrissy Teigen Is Not About to Let Slut-Shaming Trolls Ruin Her Thanksgiving Chrissy's the patron saint of comfort food and patience. 11:24 a.m.What’s Leaving Hulu: December 2016 Adios, Kill Bill. 11:17 a.m.Why Is the Second ‘G’ in Gilmore Girls Lowercase?

He was said to be unhappy with the project’s leadership. Credit Drew Angerer/Bloomberg SAN FRANCISCO — A roboticist and crucial member of the team that created Google’s self-driving car is leaving the company, the latest in a string of departures by important technologists working on the autonomous car project. Chris Urmson, a Carnegie Mellon University research scientist, joined Google in 2009 to help create the then-secret effort. He took over leadership of the team after Sebastian Thrun, the Stanford computer scientist and founder of Google X laboratory, left in 2013. Johnny Luu, a spokesman for Alphabet, the parent company of X, the company’s research division that oversees the car project, confirmed Mr. Urmson was planning to leave. “Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this lifesaving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes,” Mr. Luu wrote in an email message. The departures come after Google’s decision last year to hire John Krafcik, the former president and chief executive of Hyundai America, to be chief of the car project, as part of a plan to spin the effort out as a stand-alone company under the Alphabet umbrella. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The X research group, often called Google’s “moonshot” division, is under increasing pressure to show that at some point the company can expect a financial windfall from its projects. Google’s self-driving car project has been a pioneer in autonomous vehicle technology, but a commercial version of the car is still likely to be several years away. Mr. Urmson has been unhappy with the direction of the car project under Mr. Krafcik’s leadership and quarreled privately several months ago with Larry Page over where it was headed, according to two former Google employees. A spokesman for Google declined to comment on those discussions, but Mr. Urmson disputed they were a reason for his departure. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever.

Those part of best-of lists from top websites will also pop up in the results. Done with your lunch or dinner? Search for where you can have your dessert. You might see new spots earlier reviewed on Zagat, Serious Eats, and Eater. Even before you grab a meal or dessert, feel free to explore a new place by checking out top tourist spots or activities happening while you’re there.

Google has made no secret of its ambitions to eradicate passwords. The search company is now taking its war on passwords a step further by rolling out an API that will allow Android apps to access login credentials, essentially eliminating the need for passwords on the device. The project, launched as a collaboration with Dashlane and Google, is being called “Open YOLO” (You Only Login Once). Dashlane said it is “spearheading” the collaboration, although the API will become available to other password management companies. Other password managers “will contribute their unique security and software development expertise” to improve on the open API, Malaika Nicholas, community manager at the New York-based identity management company, wrote in a blog post announcing the project. The project “absolutely has the potential to bolster Android security and simplify the user login experience,” Elad Yoran, executive chairman of KoolSpan, said in an email to SCMagazine.com. “Too many people use duplicate passwords or struggle to manage their login credentials, and password managers organize the information and guarantee that passwords are long, complex and unique.” Password re-use has become an increasingly dangerous scenario following the discovery of LinkedIn, MySpace and Tumblr login credentials for sale on the Dark Web. Password attacks have caused a slew of sites, including Reddit and Citrix's GoToMyPC, to forcibly reset user passwords. Automating password security “is a positive for all sides,” noted Jonathan Sander, VP at Lieberman Software, in an email to SCMagazine.com. “Users get better passwords, services get less vulnerable accounts in their system and no one needs to do the hard work by hand.” However, some pros see a need to move away from passwords entirely, and believe the API is a move in the wrong direction. The project “does nothing to reduce the inherent risks of password managers,” John Gunn, VP with VASCO Data Security, said in an email to SCMagazine.com. He noted that newer methods, including two-factor and multi-factor authentication processes, geolocation, biometrics and OTPs, are more effective. “This project could fail simply by succeeding in prolonging the much-needed move away from 30-year-old password technology.” Indeed, users are becoming more comfortable with modern authentication methods. In a May study, 52 percent of consumers said they would prefer newer methods compared to using traditional username and password login credentials.

It’s only a question of how long it takes to defeat the current cabal of ISPs that everybody loves to hate. I don’t know a single person who likes their internet service provider. Even if their home or office internet is very fast and reliable, just a single customer service call — or a gander at this month’s bill — is usually enough to send a consumer over the edge. Google is looking to change all that by bringing its ultra-fast fiber optic network to everyone. Or maybe not everyone, but most people. Eventually. If you live in a major city, your chances are at least pretty good that you’ll get access to Google Fiber within the next ten years. It’s not that Google isn’t trying hard enough to expand. More often than not, Google’s hurdles are litigious rather than technical, more fighting city hall than fighting slow infrastructure. The old guard of Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and others are doing everything possible to block Google’s expansion. In Nashville, for example, AT&T and Comcast are lobbying against a bill that would allow Google to use utility poles to run its wires. AT&T even filed a lawsuit in Louisville aimed at blocking fiber. The odds are stacked against Google, but the payoff is worth it. As Business Insider reports, the U.S. lags most other developed nations in terms of fiber availability: With nearly 90% of the country stuck with relatively slow internet speeds, there’s clearly a huge opportunity to offer consumers a better service at a lower price. It’s also worth noting that current ISPs could do what Google is doing themselves, but they won’t, because they don’t have to. There’s so little competition in most markets for high-speed internet that they can just sit back and charge subscribers an arm and a leg for subpar service. Here’s hoping that Google Fiber finally gets to the majority of us sooner than later. Alphabet shares closed at $806.96 on Friday, up $9.71 (+1.22%). GOOGL shares have risen 3.72% year-to-date, trailing the S&P 500’s 7% gain in the same period.

As first reported by Android Police, the latest version of the Android Wear app informs users of the coming shutdown when they attempt to configure Together. Google says that "many of the best features of Together will be integrated directly into" the forthcoming Android Wear 2.0 update, due to arrive sometime this fall. Together was launched just about a year ago and is best described as Google's answer to the Apple Watch's Digital Touch feature, and let two Android Wear users link their devices and keep in contact with each other directly from a special watchface. It let the two users share emoji, location, photos, and doodles with each other without having to dive into an app. Google notes that in addition to emoji, Android Wear 2.0 will let users communicate via Smart Reply, a keyboard, or handwriting in a number of messaging services. Android Wear 2.0 isn't expected to arrive until this fall, and it's not clear if it will come before Together shuts down on September 30th. As Android Police notes, first-generation Android Wear watches are not likely to get the update to Wear 2.0, which means they'll lose the Together feature without gaining any of the platform integrations coming with the update.

What could that mean? Verizon rumored to carry new 'Nexus' phones 0 Phones by Lance Whitney August 5, 2016 10:07 AM PDT @lancewhit Up Next The biggest tech turkeys of 2016 Google's Nexus phones may have lined up Verizon as one carrier.Photo by CNET Verizon has been tipped off as one carrier that will sell this year's new Nexus phones. A tweet Thursday from known and typically accurate leaker Evan Blass, aka @evleaks, said simply: "Verizon is going to carry the two 'Nexus' handsets (note the quotation marks)." Ok, so we have a bit to chew on in that one sentence. Let's provide some background on Google's Nexus phones first. Verizon carrying Nexus phones would mark a return to a more traditional carrier relationship for Google. The search giant has had an on-again-off-again relationship with the carriers, often insisting on selling its Nexus phones directly to consumers, with mixed results. The Nexus phones come unlocked from Google with stock Android installed, meaning no additional features, software or bloatware to muddle the experience. Launched in 2014, the Nexus 6 phone was sold by all four major US carriers -- Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile. The version offered by Verizon was severely criticized for being crammed with bloatware. As a result of Verizon's tinkering, many users felt the Nexus 6 offered by the carrier was no longer a true Nexus. So the quotation marks could be a subtle hint by Blass that this year's Nexus phones served up by Verizon may be subject to the same overhaul that hurt the Nexus 6. Another theory: Verizon may sell the phones but give them a different monicker, perhaps losing the Nexus name. A question pops up from the tweet. Would Verizon have an exclusive to sell this year's Nexus phones, or will the other major US carriers also get it on the action? Last year, Google reversed course and has been selling the current Nexus 5X and 6P phones directly from its website. The US carriers don't sell the 2015 models, though they do support the phones on their networks, and third-party retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy sell the phones as well. Snagging Verizon and possibly other carriers to sell this year's lineup would mean Google wants to expand the potential audience. Reports have said that this year's Nexus lineup will include two models made by HTC. The larger phone, code-named Marlin, is expected to sport a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display with a 2,560x1440-pixel resolution. The smaller device, dubbed Sailfish, would reportedly come with a 5-inch Full HD display with a 1,920x1080-pixel resolution. Other rumored specs include a quad-core Qualcomm processor, a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front camera, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, a USB-C port and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Verizon declined CNET's request for comment. Google told CNET it doesn't comment on rumors or speculation.

Yesterday the company announced that when searching for restaurants and bars within the Google app, results will now highlight “reviews from top critics and best-of lists from reputable publishers.” As TechCrunch notes, this means that Google users won’t have to rely on amateur reviews, but will instead see a more curated selection of expert reviews. Google explains: “If you’re craving dim sum, but not sure which place is a top spot, a search for ‘chinese restaurant’ may bring up Michelin favorite RedFarm in the West Village. Looking further at the search result, you’ll see it also appears on more than 10 best-of lists, including Eater, CBS Local and Refinery29.” Google has been accused in the past of burying review sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor from search results (Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman has accused Google of trying to hurt its competitors), though it has claimed those instances are merely glitches. One study, conducted in 2014 by Yelp, found some instances in which those who searched for "a restaurant's name and the word 'Yelp,'" were shown content such as restaurant's Google+ page as the first result. It’s unclear how this latest Google search feature will affect Yelp. The new feature — currently only available in the Google app for Android and iOS — is the latest tweak geared toward the food-obsessed. Last year, the tech company unveiled a feature that allows users to get info about hundreds of types of cheeses, such as taste, texture, and origin. • Never Miss a “Must-Try” With Google Search [Google Blog] • Google to Surface Critic Reviews and Best-Of List Inclusions for Bars and Restaurants [TechCrunch] • All Google Coverage [E] More From Eater The 2016 Eater Gift Guide The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World Presented by Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap Eater Young Guns 2016: Meet the Winners “You Girls Having Fun?” Why Cookbooks Are Looking More and More Like Comic Books Most Read Searzall Creator Unveils the Spinzall, a Centrifuge for Food Geeks Shibumi Is the Future of Japanese Dining in America Maggiano’s Is Sorry for Hosting a Bunch of White Supremacists Over the Weekend This Article has a component height of 7.

This included giving the go-ahead to Google’s Project Wing. Google to Test Project Wing Drone Delivery Service in the U.S. https://t.co/bNcCwjLLnT— Entrepreneur (@Entrepreneur) August 4, 2016 While the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has given the green light for around twelve public-private initiatives to explore the use of drones and unmanned aircraft system variants, much of the attention is upon the biggest player: Google (though, technically via Google's parent company Alphabet.) Google's drone project is called Project Wing. In total, the U.S. government is investing $35 million in funding over the next five years for research into how drones. The Project Wing study concerns developing drones for delivery purposes. With White House backing, Google will carry out a practical research study at a specified test site in either Alaska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas or Virginia. The drones will fly at around 400 feet and the key part of the project is to assess whether drones can be successfully operated for delivery when out of the operator's line of sight. As well as Google, another use of drones is the Bloodworks Northwest study to assess the feasibility of delivering blood products to remote communities. The study will be based on the communities of the San Juan Islands. For receiving public money, the companies involved must pass on some data for other developers. According to Fortune, the White House has stated data from the project must be shared “with government partners to help regulators answer critical safety and human factors questions." In related news, Amazon Prime Air received a boost from the British government. Amazon has been given clearance to explore the steps necessary to make the delivery of parcels by small drones a reality across British towns and cities. It seems that Amazon are to focus their drone development in the U.K., whereas Google will pioneer their drone system in the U.S. More about Drones, Project Wing, Google, White house More news from Drones Project Wing Google White house Latest News Top News Germany amused by French candidate Fillon's Cold War map Weird blue mass detected in front of the Sun In crisis-struck Rio, police need donated toilet paper Verdict in Harris case reached: kid's death was not accidental Trump taps South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley for UN ambassador Aleppo civilians try to flee as Syria army advances 'Russians, Americans and Turks' trying to destroy Europe: top MEP London chef Stephen Port found guilty of gay date-rape murders Iraq forces cut off IS-held Mosul from Syria Obama awards his final Presidential Medals of Freedom Corporate Contact Us About Us Advertise Investors & Partners Help & Support Editorial Guidelines Terms of Use Privacy Policy News Links Latest News Live Events News Alerts GlobeNewswire News Global Press Releases 24-7PressRelease.com copyright © 2016 digitaljournal.com   |   powered by dell servers

STRATEGY How Google's Moonshot Strategy Is Paying Off Use a moonshot as your shot to discover new possibilities and ensure long-term success. By Josh Linkner Josh Linkner is a five-time entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and professor, and the New York Times best-selling author of Disciplined Dreaming: A Proven System to Drive Breakthrough Creativity. You can read more at JoshLinkner.com. @JoshLinkner Entrepreneur, author, VC, jazz guitarist@JoshLinkner WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement This past Thursday, Alphabet (Google's parent company) conducted their quarterly earnings call. The company's ability to grow and basically print money wasn't unexpected at all, since they deliver exceptional performance with stunning regularity. What drew controversy was the amount of money the company lost in the quarter on moonshots, projects that could be game changers over the long term but don't have a near-term payoff. $859 million. That's right, almost a billion dollars of losses on idealistic projects that may never pay off. Self-driving cars, high-speed fiber and life sciences, among others, are far afield from Google's meat-and-potatoes revenue of Internet advertising. With such a seemingly catastrophic misstep, you might expect callous Wall Street traders to severely punish the stock price. Yet the company gained 5% on the news. Put another way, the company "lost" $859 million on pie-in-the-sky experiments but gained $27.3 billion in market value. How does this make any sense? Penny-pinching CFO's may see red, but the innovators at Alphabet envision a beautiful hue of gold. Companies that enjoy sustainable success are the ones that allocate a certain percentage of their budget for moonshot projects. Fully understanding that some ideas will flop, this becomes the laboratory for the next big commercial success. Rather than waiting to be jarred by a disruptive entrepreneur, organizations that invest in the future are the ones who enjoy it. While most of us don't have piles of Google loot lying around to invest, we can still embrace the concept of moonshots. When you examine the resources at your disposal - time, money, talent, equipment, materials, software, etc. - think about allocating a small percent to your own moonshots. What if you deployed 5% of your annual revenue toward big, bold ideas for the future? While it may feel risky, or even frivolous, think how different your company or career may look five years from now by investing in game-changing endeavors. At the same time, think how the competition may blow right past you if you focus only on maximizing short-term gains while ignoring the moonshot ideas altogether. Your moonshot could be a product or a service, a process or a procurement innovation, team structure or geographic expansion, corporate culture or customer experience. Explore the various elements of your business, and you'll discover plenty of moonshot possibilities to pursue. No matter the size of your organization, someday a company will come along and put you out of business. It might as well be you. Use a moonshot as your shot - to discover new possibilities and ensure long-term success. Now that's a shot worth taking.   The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Aug 2, 2016 Advertisement

Riind RIIND is a young design studio founded by two MIT engineering graduates, and its first product is a pen. You might be thinking, okay, two MIT engineers design a pen. It must send digital copies of your writing to your phone via Bluetooth, or enable AI-powered handwriting. But nope. The pen—dubbed, breathlessly, The Pen—is really just a pen. Not a stylus, not an e-pencil, but an ink-to-paper pen that’s made out of aluminum and looks like a bullet. According to RIIND’s Kickstarter page, its founders got the idea for The Pen ($99) in October 2014. Twenty months worth of engineering later, and The Pen is here. It comes with a suite of features, chief of which is its clip. The clasp rotates to the left or right, making it possible for users to affix it snugly to the inside of a button down shirt, rather than just vertically onto a pocket. Plus, the knurled section at the top of the pen swivels around 180 degrees either way, causing the pen’s tip to protract and retract—a feature the founders say two years to invent. Once the ink cartridge is empty, users can refill it with 35 different kinds of ink—kind of like choosing your preferred font, but, you know, the medieval way. Go Back to Top.

In that time, it’s observed a steady increase in the average body mass index, and with it, the country’s obesity rates. Over at Flowing Data, Nathan Yau has organized this trend into the handy set of graphics you see above. The maps here visualize the steady rise in the prevalence of adult obesity by turning from green, used to indicate obesity rates of less than 20 percent, to purple, for rates higher than 20 percent. Most articles on the so-called “obesity epidemic” use broad-strokes statistics to describe the issue, as in: “about 38 percent of American adults were obese in 2013 and 2014, up from 35 percent in 2011 and 2012,” from The New York Times. Yau’s infographic breaks down the numbers by state. Strikingly, the states appear as a grid of equal-sized squares—a mapping strategy that Yau borrowed from FiveThirtyEight. “When you size by geographic area, the bigger states inevitably get more visual attention,” he says. Now, with the map’s 8-bit looks, all states have equal representation. It won’t change the appearance of overarching trends, but it’s a helpful distortion if you want to isolate patterns happening in individual states. Go Back to Top.

Black Friday 2016 TV Deals Frequent Flier Miles Are Kaput—The Game's About Credit Cards Now 6 Just last month, the Internet decided we’d hit “peak LaCroix.” The alleged watershed moment had to do with a cake decorated like a 12-pack of lime-flavored LaCroix, spotted at the newly opened Whole Foods in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. The cake even came with little LaCroix sidekick cupcakes. It seemed LaCroix memes could go no further. Turns out they can, and this LaCroix flavor-generator is proof. It’s from Nelson Cash, the same creative studio that recently released the Stranger Things type-generator. The online fanfare over Make It Stranger gave the Chicago designers and lovers of LaCroix the idea to build another interactive web toy. The result is MyLaCroix.com, a meme-generator that looks like somebody built it with GeoCities. “I think a lot of people—and millennials my age—like LaCroix because it has that ‘90s jazz vibe,” says Mike McMillan, the designer at Nelson Cage who led the LaCroix project. “We thought, okay, we should design it like Windows 95. It’s an homage to the past.” To create your bespoke LaCroix flavor, you first need to name it. You can play it safe with something mildly exotic yet cheeky, like “cilantro,” or “imitation crab,” or you can show everyone how topical you are, with “Uber”-flavored LaCroix. Or you can go really meta. The most convincing cans feature a considered color scheme, but finding one that works is no small task. LaCroix’s cans bear splashy combinations of six hues, and the flavor-generator web toy gives you two gradients for selecting each one, which adds up to a lot of potential combinations. Getting them right is important—like McMillan says, the frothy scrawls on the outside of the can are integral to the LaCroix experience. That’s where the fizz hits you first. Go Back to Top.

And before Arkanoid, there was Atari’s Breakout. In all of these games, a ball ricochets around the screen, destroying bricks. Your job is simple: keep that ball bouncing upward, eliminating bricks. Architectural prodigy Bjarke Ingels’ firm, BIG, just turned its website into a BIG-branded version of Arkanoid. The makeover wasn’t all that drastic; the firm’s home page design already featured an array of neon-hued icons, each linked to a project. Now, rather than a chronological arrangement, the icons cluster by color. A mouse-controlled “paddle” at the bottom bats the ball around. Why the gimmick? Unclear. You can’t navigate the page if you aren’t busting bricks, and there’s no obvious incentive to play beyond nostalgia or beating your high score. The Konami Code also does nothing. That said, Ingels is a fan of virtual worlds, including Minecraft and its analog predecessor, Lego. (Both appear to have influenced his design of London’s latest Serpentine Pavilion.) “These fictional worlds empower people with the tools to transform their own environments,” Ingels has said. “This is what architecture ought to be.” Perhaps that’s all there is to it: diversion for diversion’s sake. The Arkanoidification of BIG’s website won’t help you navigate the firm’s roster of projects, and it probably won’t inspire you the way a bucket of Lego bricks would—but Ingels, and BIG, are clearly big proponents of play.

Giger Made Alien‘s Monster Beautiful and Terrifying When Alien hit theaters in 1979, the monster on screen was unlike anything moviegoers had ever seen. The film’s deadly, parasitic Xenomorph was terrifying and grotesque, yet graceful and stunning. “I always wanted my alien to be a very beautiful thing, something aesthetic,” production designer H.R. Giger has said of his creation. “A monster isn’t just something disgusting; it can have a kind of beauty.” Giger, a Swiss artist known as much for his darkly surreal paintings as for his cinematic work, is the subject of a new video essay that explores how his background in design informed not just the appearance of Alien‘s titular interstellar stowaway, but the look, feel, and pacing of the film, itself. The video, made by Kristian Williams, is a reminder of just how brilliant Giger’s Academy Award-winning design work was, and still is. As Williams explains it, director Ridley Scott came across Giger’s Necronomicon, Giger’s first book dedicated to his macabre, biomechanical aesthetic, while trying to conceptualize what the film’s monster should look like. An illustration titled Necronom #4, depicting a sinuous creature with an elongated head, so affected Scott that he asked Giger to alter his original design only slightly. More H.R. Giger Never-Before-Seen Sketches That Inspired the Birth of Alien Probing the Alien Artist’s Mind H.R. Giger’s Cyborg Horror Merges Sex, Tech, Legend Giger wound up working on the film’s entire production design. “Down the line I realized it made a lot of sense for Giger to design everything that was to do with the alien,” Ridley recalls in the video. “That includes the landscape and the spacecraft.” Giger’s morbid biology-meets-industrial touch can be see everywhere in LV426, but his alien was the showstopper. Williams says that Giger himself fabricated the costumes, which made good use of his industrial design background. Every piece of the costume was considered, from the mouth-breathing apparatus on its back to the fact that its acidic blood required an acid-resistant exoskeleton (fun fact: the costume incorporated real bones, human and animal). Giger built the xenomorph’s lips from condoms, and nestled a real human skull into the tip of the alien’s cylindrical head. As the video points out, Giger’s aesthetic has become so acknowledged it has its own adjective “Gigeresque.” In a time where monsters are the result of clicking around on a computer, it’s no wonder we’re still in awe of Giger’s wildly creative alien. Like all movie monsters, it’s a product of an artist’s imagination, but it’s a whole lot scarier when you can actually reach out and touch it. Go Back to Top.

We’ve dissected all of season 1, right down to the opening titles and props. Now we’re stuck waiting for an as-yet unannounced date in 2017, when season 2 will drop. In the meantime, here’s a neat toy to tide over any nostalgia cravings: Ramsophone, an online music-maker that lets you click and tap to create your own synthwave score. Designer and developer Robert Vinluan created it, and although he says that “resemblances to the Stranger Things theme may or may not be intentional,” we know what we hear. This is a DIY Stranger Things-style synth machine, and it’s seriously fun. The Ramsophone sounds like the 1980s, but its looks are firmly rooted in the ’50s and ’60s, when Dieter Rams (after whom the Ramsophome is named) was designing for Braun. The interface features little more than a few white knobs and push buttons to compose your beats, and a tiny red button to turn the music on and off. To mix up the music-maker’s form factor, just refresh the page. You can do this endlessly—Vinluan doesn’t know the exact number of available layouts, but says somewhere between 50,000,000 and 100,000,000 combinations sounds reasonable. His code is available on Github, if you want the nitty-gritty on how that works. Even with those millions of configurations, the Ramsophone, like a good Braun gadget, keeps it simple. You really can’t mess this up—your score will be perfectly eerie every time. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. dieter rams Music stranger things Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Though the famed German art school existed in physical form for just 14 years, its legacy lives on in many ways. The latest incarnation: Harvard’s massive online archive. The school recently made more than 32,000 digitized artifacts—paintings, drawings, photos, sculptures, and more—available for browsing, and it’s a beautiful time-suck for design lovers. Harvard’s first Bauhaus show was held in 1930. Organized by undergrads, it was also the first Bauhaus exhibition in the United States. We are revisiting Bauhaus materials, such as this 1930 catalogue, as we prepare to host another Bauhaus exhibition in 2019—the 100th anniversary of the school’s founding. See our profile for the link to the Bauhaus Special Collection. #bauhaus #archives #harvard #bauhaus100 — Image credit: Catalogue of the 1930 Bauhaus exhibition, Harvard Society for Contemporary Art, Harvard University Archives, HUD 3298, Box 1. A photo posted by Harvard Art Museums (@harvardartmuseums) on Aug 15, 2016 at 12:17pm PDT Architect Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in 1919 with the goal of creating a utopian school where the disciplines of art and design could overlap and dissolve into a unified artistic language. The school ran workshops on everything from architecture to weaving to graphic design, but its most famous exports, by far, were the people who studied there. Bauhaus alumni were a prolific and influential bunch. Even after the school shuttered in 1933 due to pressure from the Nazi regime, the artists and designers who studied there continued to spread the school’s teachings. Mies van der Rohe, the architect and final director of the Bauhaus, immigrated to Chicago to become director of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute, now the Illinois Institute of Technology. Designer Josef Albers departed for Black Mountain College in North Carolina before heading to teach at Yale. Gropius landed at Harvard, where he chaired the Graduate School of Design from 1937 to 1952. And thus began Harvard’s deep ties to the Bauhaus. Over the years, Bauhaus masters and lesser-known students have donated their work to Harvard’s Busch-Reisinger Museum, giving rise to one of the largest collections of Bauhaus ephemera in the world. Harvard has done an excellent job in making what could be a paralyzing amount of information accessible. The archive is organized by medium and showcases the student work of famed designers. The items are searchable by keyword, title, artist, or object number. Though the archive helps to contextualize the massive amount of work produced by Bauhaus designers, it frankly doesn’t have much work to do. The Bauhaus’ legacy is already-well established through its long lineage of influential designers— now it’s just easier to find their work. Anni Albers’s “Design for a Rug” (1927) is one of the more than 32,000 objects whose records are now accessible in our Bauhaus Special Collection. Albers taught in the influential school of modernist art and design active during the years of Germany’s Weimar Republic (1919–33). Bauhaus artists were known for realigning hierarchies of high and low by embracing new technologies, materials, and media.

Designed by type foundry Monotype, it’s the first update to the typeface since the late 1970s, when it was adjusted for new typesetting technology. It’s meant to do two things: (1) Update Johnston so that it’s as legible as possible on screens and (2) Bring back some of the “soul” and “quirk” from the original 1916 design. Off-kilter details like the diagonal bowl on the lowercase ‘g’ and the unusually wide ‘U’ were lost over the years, but have been reintroduced in Johnston100. Monotype TfL, the governing body for all things Underground-related, has used Johnston since 1916. Johnston is a friendly, sensible, sans serif typeface that was totally ahead of its time. A calligrapher created it, but its looks are unembellished. That’s largely how it endured all these years; its uncluttered proportions were ideal for a typeface that lives in a frantic, schedule-driven environment like the London Underground. Monotype Endure it did, but as prescient as Edward Johnston was about type design, it’s not like he predicted that one day travelers would check train schedules primarily through an app. The other new elements of Johnston100 exist purely to make the typeface internet-appropriate—like the @ and # characters. The original Johnston never had, or needed, those icons. Slapdash ones were added in recent years, but Monotype has carefully redrawn them to fit in with the rest of the font family. This is one way TfL is modernizing its signage; the other is through the five new weights of Johnston100. In its original weight, Johnston would be far too thick to read on a smartphone screen. The new “thin” and “hairline” weights, however, are much more pixel-friendly. That’s a crucial update for users: 100 years after Johnston was born, the London Underground doesn’t exist solely underground. It’s on desktop browsers, touch screens, and in travelers’s pockets.

Despite appearances, our icy neighbor to the north is 1.5 times smaller than India, more than four times smaller than the United States, and 14.5 times smaller than Africa. In fact, Greenland is about the size of Saudi Arabia, though you’d never guess it by looking at the world’s most ubiquitous map. The Mercator projection is an inherently flawed design. It exaggerates the size of countries closest to the poles while depicting size most faithfully at the equator. Though it was once a handy navigational tool for sailors, the map has instilled in the rest of us a gross misunderstanding of geography and relative country size. For the perspective-challenged among us, there’s hope yet. A new web app called The True Size Of is an interactive map that its creators, James Talmage and Damon Maneice, hope will give people a better understanding of a country’s true size. Dragging one country across the map causes it to change size and shape in real time, allowing you to place it beside countries at other latitudes and compare their relative sizes. For example, as you overlay the United States on top of Greenland, the former stretches and bloats. Meanwhile, dragging Greenland down toward Saudi Arabia, causes the northerly country to shrink dramatically in size. For even more accuracy, you can use a compass in the bottom lefthand corner of the screen to rotate each country for alignment. It’s a simple tool, but it’s wildly effective at granting a new perspective on the size and shape of the world’s various land masses. As we all know from years of staring at maps that tell us otherwise, that kind of perspective is pretty hard to come by. You can play with the map here. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

For his master’s thesis, Choi, who recently graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven, created benches and stools that lay flat but pop open. He calls it De-dimension, and it’s flatpack with a perceptual twist: a perspective drawing come to life, its planar form conveying the height, width, and depth of the “assembled” stool. In the video, Choi pulls one from the wall and, with a smooth, quick gesture, opens it like the page of a pop-up book. Click over to Choi’s website and you’ll find that his furniture is the physical embodiment of a thesis exploring heady ideas about perspective and how we perceive the similarities and differences between 2-D and 3-D objects. “If our perception of an object is not different on a plane image and an actual subject,” he asks, “isn’t it possible to substitute the two with each other?” In the case of De-Dimension, the stools and benches are never truly 2-D; but the fact our brains can appreciate their dimensionality, even when flat, is a clever visual trick that would earn Choi an awful lot of money if he decides to sell his designs.

Try This Interactive Chart Daniel Smilkov and Shan Carter If you’ve recently found yourself wondering what the f*@k neural networks are and how they work, you’re hardly alone. The rise of machine learning has made artificial neural networks—the computer programs that facilitate that learning—a common topic of conversation. Google, Facebook, and most other big players in the tech industry are investing heavily in them. News articles about artificial intelligence (including ours) are littered with references to neural networks. Still, getting inundated with an idea doesn’t mean you understand it. Daniel Smilkov, a member of Google’s Big Picture Research Group, and Shan Carter, who creates interactive graphics for The New York Times, decided to make the concept more easily digestible. They collaborated to create this interactive data-visualization that lets users toy around with and design their own neural network. It’s not quite kindergarten for neural networks; you need to have a grasp on notions like inputs, regularization, and ratio train data going into what Smilkov and Carter call their “playground.” If you do, the data-viz functions like a plug-and-play interface for trying out different programs. There’s even a play button and a rewind button—if you don’t succeed, just try again. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Data Visualization neural networks Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Venngage, the company that lets you make infographics with the click of (a few) buttons, recently launched a new product called Beam. Beam does for charts what Venngage does for infographics as a whole. Which is to say, it makes the process of transforming data into useful visuals very, very easy. Beam is built on a template. Swap out the default text and data for your own, and you’ve got the bones of a chart. The web tool comes with four chart options—pie, bar, column, and line—and a handful of formatting choices. If we’re being real, the variety isn’t Earth-shatteringly cool. It would be a lot more fun if you could choose your own color scheme as opposed to Beam’s pre-packaged swatches, for example. But what the tool lacks in choice it makes up for in efficiency. Beam holds your hand through the entire process. Embedding the chart is a matter of copy and pasting a link, and Beam makes it super easy to share on social media. It’s clear that Beam is trying to be the go-to chart design tool for the Instagram set (the company said so itself!). And fair enough—the tool, for better or worse, does democratize the process of making clean, accurate graphics. I’m not sure how many teens are going to be uploading pie charts to their profiles, but who knows.

Today you’re 40. To celebrate, we’ve compiled a list of the company’s 15 most pivotal products, starting with the design of the iPhone and ending with the San Bernardino iPhone. But to see all of Apple’s products from the past four decades, at once, look to “The Insanely Great History of Apple 3.0” ($90)—a comprehensive visual overview of Apple’s oeuvre, from the folks at Pop Charts Lab. The Brooklyn infographic-makers created the original chart in 2011, when the iPad 2 was the latest innovation. Now, they’ve updated it to include everything up to the iPhone SE and 9.7” iPad Pro, both of which were added to Apple’s lineup after the recent Apple event in Cupertino. The updated poster, like the original, is organized by year and device category (software, all-in-ones, handhelds, and so on). You can watch as Apple shrinks from the bulky Lisa to the Apple Watch, but you can also see, quite clearly, the impact of Steve Jobs’ return to the company, in 1997. The y-axis of “The Insanely Great History of Apple 3.0” shows the year, and the top half of the chart is a cluster of tiny icons. Toward the poster’s bottom half (which chart’s the period after Apple bought NeXT, and Jobs returned), the data visualization becomes sparser. Apple rolled out the bulbous, colorful iMac, the iBook, and, a few years later, the iPod. The trend toward fewer offerings reflects a shift in Apple’s strategy: Rather than asking consumers to choose between a slew of options, Apple would choose for them. The post-Jobs years have followed that trend, with the exception of the handheld category, where options remains an important selling point. You can see it spelled out in the data, on the bottom-righthand corner of the poster: it’s a swarm of gadgets, in a range of sizes. Go Back to Top.

Now, a national referendum has put the idea to rest: New Zealand will keep the Blue Ensign it’s used since 1902. In keeping the venerable banner, New Zealanders rejected the Silver Fern, designed by architect Kyle Lockwood of Auckland. His design kept the current flag’s four red stars but replaced the Union Jack a silver fern frond as its primary motif. The silver fern is a familiar symbol throughout the country, one used by the All Blacks rugby team and a few official tourism campaigns. #NZ flag results https://t.co/vljBZKoQjY pic.twitter.com/nzU9fzPUuW — nzherald (@nzherald) March 24, 2016 Of the votes cast, 56.6 percent were in favor of keeping the current flag, and 43.2 percent favored the fern. Prime Minister John Key, a vocal advocate for this campaign, which cost New Zealand a reported $26 million, told reporters he would not revisit the topic. After the government announced in October, 2014, that it would consider exploring a new flag, thousands of aspiring designers submitted ideas. Many can only be described as batshit insane, and we’ll let John Oliver tell you about them. But there were plenty of good designs, according to the rules of vexillology, and the Silver Fern was among them. It’s simple enough to remember, but its meaning is unique to New Zealand: local lore traces the fern’s origins to the Māori, the country’s indigenous Polynesian population. Adopting it in place of the Union Jack icon would have symbolically divorced New Zealand’s flag from that of Australia and the United Kingdom.

If you stop typing for more than five seconds, all progress will be lost.” Those are the directions for The Most Dangerous Writing App, a brutal new web tool designed to help you get over your writer’s block. The app is the work of Manuel Ebert, who describes himself on Twitter as a “Ex-neuroscientist, data wrangler, designer, and engineer.” He’s also a founding partner of Summer.ai, a small data consultancy agency. Ebert made The Most Dangerous Writing App on his own time, and released it for free. There are lots of tricks for overcoming writer’s block. One of the most commonly prescribed bits of advice is perhaps the most obvious: just write. That could mean banging out a rough draft in one fell swoop, or it could mean pretending like you’re writing in a diary, letting out a stream of consciousness. Or, as editors love to say, “just pretend you’re at a bar, having a beer, talking to your friend.” The Most Dangerous Writing App The goal of all these strategies is to force you to get over your ego. Stop waiting for a romantic surge of inspiration and just write. The Most Dangerous Writing App doesn’t care what technique you use, provided you keep typing. If you stop, even for a second, the edges of the screen become tinged with red. The longer you go without typing, the redder the edges become, until, after five seconds of inactivity, your progress is unceremoniously erased. Forever. While writing this I somewhat predictably experienced a small bout of writer’s block, so I gave the app a try. The interface is a clean, no-nonsense text editor. You’ll find nothing in the way of formatting tools; if it wasn’t already abundantly clear, the app is purpose-built for writing and writing only. It allows for plenty of backspacing and typo-correcting, both of which can be useful for procrastinating in micro-doses, but I mostly felt compelled to write. Somewhere towards the tail end of my five minutes (you can choose to write nonstop for five, 10, 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes, if you’re a masochist) the pressure starts to set in, and I’m really rambling. The UX is cleverly conceived, if a bit stressful at first (my heart rate went up while I was using it). The Most Dangerous Writing App But then, that imposed sense of urgency is the whole point. If you’re someone who thrives under pressure, or feels most productive when you’re working at the eleventh hour, the Most Dangerous Writing App could be a good way for you to apply that pressure, artificially. And for the record, it did get me over my writer’s block. You’re reading this article now, aren’t you? Go Back to Top.

Letters are easy enough—we learn the alphabet as children and then cease to consciously notice them as time goes on—but typography, the art of crafting the written language, is a tricky business. Typographers create fonts in type design software, where letters are mapped with a series of coordinates. By tweaking each vector a millimeter here, and a hair there, designers can create the kind of expressiveness that differentiates Baskerville from, say, Courier. Both are serif typefaces, but they feel extraordinarily different. “The Taxonomy of Typography,” a new print from the Pop Chart Lab poster-makers, explains the typographer’s palette. Painters have colors; typographers have neo-grotesque type, ascenders, and letter-spacing. Like a periodic table of type elements, the chart explains typography by breaking down varieties of type, letter anatomy, measurements and spacing, and typesetting. Whether you’re a type neophyte or a seasoned designer, it’s a handy chart. You can snag one through Pop Chart Lab’s pre-order sale, for $29, here. Pop Chart Lab Go Back to Top.

There was this book. Then these posters. Now, there’s yet another set of visualizations that looks at the unsung heroes of literature. Inspired by Nicholas Rougeux’s “Between The Words” posters, scientist Adam Calhoun decided to put his own spin on punctuation as visualization. Calhoun was curious to see how the punctuation in his favorite books stacked up, so he wrote a script that strips the words from the pages. Next to Rougeux’s swirling posters, Calhoun’s visualizations are less abstract, more straightforward. In one, he simply leaves them as-is—a block of periods, commas and dashes in all their geometric, grammatical beauty. In another, he assigns each glyph a color, creating glowing heatmaps that show which marks are most prevalent. Calhoun takes it one step further by breaking down the data into digestible bar charts that show words per punctuation mark, words per sentence, and overall use of punctuation. Unsurprisingly, Earnest Hemmingway’s “A Farewell to Arms”  is lacking in punctuational flourishes, relying only on periods and quotations to fill out the author’s stark writing style. William Faulkner, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid of a wordy sentence and a semicolon or ten. It’s hard to say what’s behind the recent spike in interest in punctuation. For Calhoun, the intrigue seems to lie in the unspoken impact punctuation has on an author’s writing. For others, it might be that the glyphs, themselves, are admiration-worthy pieces of design. Either way, it’s clearly a good time to be a word nerd. Adam Calhoun Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Books charts Data Visualization punctuation Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Kyu is part of Tokyo’s Hakuhodo DY Holdings, and includes other agencies like Sid Lee, Red Peak Group, and Digital Kitchen. The dollar value of the partial acquisition, and the fraction of Ideo’s business that it constitutes, have not been made public. In a post on Medium, Ideo’s CEO Tim Brown explains: The rate of change has been dizzying, and today’s advanced technologies — AI, genomics, robotics, data science, the Internet of Things — have so outpaced our industrial-era organizations and infrastructure, they end up hitting institutional cul-de-sacs. The technologies don’t come to a halt, of course, they simply move on, seeking out other places where they race ahead. If our institutions are to survive, they’ll have to create new roadways. That’s a design problem — one that requires new rules of engagement with a broad set of collaborators. We’re excited to have found those collaborators in a few like-minded design firms. In the same post, Brown quickly dismisses the idea that Ideo is “caught in the much ballyhooed death spiral of the independent design firm.” Instead, he says the decision to sell a stake in Ideo’s business and join a collective is part of a larger mission to “apply our collective design practice to greater challenges.” Whatever the reason, the business deal fits the larger trend of big firms buying up smaller design studios. McKinsey bought Lunar; Yves Béhar sold a majority stake in fuseproject to the Chinese holding company BlueFocus. In many ways, these transitions aren’t new. There’s a long history of commingling between design and business (more on that here). Ideo is just the latest—and most high-profile—firm to make such a move. Go Back to Top.

The happy Mac. Susan Kare designed them all. In creating these and most of the other icons on the original Apple Macintosh, she established the visual language that would form the foundation of point-and-click computing.  Here, Kare, icon of icons, talks about the creative decisions behind some of the best-loved symbols of the past four decades. Kare delivered this presentation at last year’s Layers Design Conference in San Francisco, but the video was only recently posted online. It’s full of fresh observations about the creative process, insights about her time at Apple, and advice for designing with accessibility in mind; so even if you’re familiar with Kare and her work, we’re willing to bet you’ll find something new here. We knew from Kare’s 2013 book, for example, that the command icon (⌘) was originally a symbol used to denote interesting features at Swedish campgrounds, but the story of how she stumbled upon the symbol in the first place, and how she weighed its merits at the time, was new to us. (Her description of her first trip to Sweden, decades after she copped the command icon for Apple, is also pretty damn charming.)   Her talk’s about half an hour long and well worth watching in its entirety. The second half of the video, a Q&A between Kare and Daring Fireball’s John Gruber, is also worth a watch. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

He’s got a bushy beard, a DGAF attitude, and, you know, a bunch of really awesome graphic design work to his name. He’s done identities for Patagonia and Nike Skateboarding, record covers for Conor Oberst, print work for WIRED, and is the guy behind those ubiquitous Field Notes notebooks. Draplin is a branding man who’s ultimately become a brand himself. Now the designer is dropping a book called “Pretty Much Everything” (out May 17), and according to the official announcement it’s going to be a “mid-career survey of work, case studies, inspiration, road stories, lists, covers, and logos.” Chances are it’s probably going to be pretty damn funny, too.

Artist Leo Villareal designed a massive installation that transformed the bridge that stretches between Oakland and San Francisco into a canvas of shimmering lights. It was public art on a grand scale; like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, only bigger. Some numbers: 25,000 lights, 1.8 miles long, 500 feet high. It twinkled for two years and then in March of 2015, the lights turned off. Now, just in time for the Super Bowl, the lights are coming back. Thanks to $4 million in funding, Illuminate the Arts commissioned Villareal to design a new light show, which we can only assume  will surpass the original in terms of ambition. They turn on tomorrow evening (Jan. 30), and this time, word is, they’re sticking around for good. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The iconic doll now comes in four different sizes: petite, tall, curvy, and original. You know the original size—it’s the one that, if Barbie were a life-size human woman, would leave her with a 16-inch waist and an inability to walk on her own two feet. It’s also the size that’s outraged critiques for years, prompting Mattel to make a radical design move. That move was unveiled this morning, in a TIME magazine cover story. The TIME story covers the business and design choices that went into launching the new Barbie body styles, but it also sheds some light on the origins of Barbie’s unattainable figure: Barbie has courted controversy since her birth. Her creator, Ruth Handler, based Barbie’s body on a German doll called Lilli, a prostitute gag gift handed out at bachelor parties. Her proportions were designed accordingly. When Handler introduced Barbie (named after her daughter Barbara) in 1959 at the New York Toy Fair, her male competitors laughed her out of the room: nobody, they insisted, would want to play with a doll with breasts. Still, Barbie’s sales took off, but by 1963 women were protesting the same body men had ridiculed. That year, a teen Barbie was sold with a diet book that recommended simply, “Don’t eat.” When a Barbie with pre-programmed phrases uttered, “Math class is tough,” a group called the Barbie Liberation Organization said the doll taught girls that it was more important to be pretty than smart. The new sizing lexicon is deliberately neutral, but in plain English it means that in addition to the original doll you can now buy a short Barbie, a tall Barbie, or a Barbie with hips, thighs, and a hint of meat on her bones. It’s this last one—curvy Barbie—that is the real game changer, and the one that’s stirring up reactions. They are, of course, mixed: So love this! ABOUT TIME!

The building, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is a wonder to wander through, with its soaring atrium and gleaming, spiraled ramps. It’s a museum best experienced in person, of course—but for those of who can’t make it in the flesh, good news: You can now visit through your computer. Following museums like the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate in London, the Guggenheim is the latest addition to Google’s expanding Cultural Institute project, which has digitized more than 32,000 pieces of artwork from more than 150 museums around the world since 2011. Using Google’s Street View technology, digital visitors can now explore Wright’s building, ascending and descending its ramp with a digital pair of feet. More than 120 artworks have also been digitized and made available online. The museum explains it was quite the challenge to capture the essence of the building, given its unique architecture. Apparently, it took a fleet of drone, tripod, and street view trolley cameras to get the shots that were then stitched together for a 360-degree view. We have to admit that, while it’s way cooler to see see the museum IRL, the circularity of the Guggenheim does lend itself quite nicely to the 360 experience. Go Back to Top.

Embrace the Danish Concept of Hygge Getty Images The Danish have a word, hygge, that crudely translates to “cozy.” More accurately, it translates to, that profoundly content feeling you get when it’s frigid outside but you’re inside wearing flannel and drinking hot toddies in front of a fire. Hygge, pronounced “hoo-gah,” is a bit of a polysemy. It’s derived from the Norwegian word for “well-being,” and you can feel hygge, be hygge, or do hygge. Denmark’s official tourism website has a page called “The art of Danish hygge,” which explains that hygge high season starts at Christmas, “when Danes pull out all the hygge stops,” but reassures you that you can still experience hygge in the summer. “Picnics in the park, barbeques with friends, outdoor concerts, street festivals and bike rides can all be very hygge.” According to the BBC, hygge is even a course subject at Morley College in London. Hygge is also the best way to explain the principles of Scandinavian design. Think of it like an aesthetic adaptation to the harsh winters there; when it’s below freezing and dark for 16 hours a day, making your indoor environment warm and welcoming is imperative. As Fredrik Carlström, the founder of a Scandinavian design studio called Austere, put it to me (in a separate interview), “Scandinavian design isn’t austere. It’s what is outside that’s austere and it makes our homes really nice.” It’s why furniture and lighting from that part of the world is of such high caliber. If you’re not yet hip to hygge, now might be a good time to embrace the Danish attitude towards the cold. Menacing news reports of the “crippling” and “deadly” blizzard that’s headed for the east coast will remind you to stock up on bottled water and batteries. (And you should, we’re not here to be flippant about potentially dangerous storms). But hygge, aptly described by this travel website as, “the art of creating intimacy,” might help you pull through, too. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The latest expansion was just announced, and it’s 3.2-million square feet of ziggurat-like buildings, parking areas, and mixed-use facilities. That’s massive. By comparison, Apple’s new spaceship campus will be a reported 2.8-million square feet. To pull it off, the athletic wear company is working with three different studios—ZGF Architects, SRG Partnership, and Skylab Architecture—and one landscape architecture firm. Judging from the materials available, it’s early days for the expansion. Nike released two renderings. One is an aerial view of the arrayed offices that “takes inspiration from human movement, speed and the strength and energy of competition.” The other shows off a basketball court and a series of outdoor staircases that echo Renzo Piano’s famous design for the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. CEO Mark Parker said the new designs are good for employees, which makes them good for the athletes who wear Nike’s stuff. “We relentlessly evolve how we inspire our own teams and design environments that foster chemistry and collaboration.” It’s slated to open in 2018.

The folks over at Threadbase, a newly launched data project, know this and are here to help. The founders are on a mission to, “organize clothing data and make it searchable,” and for their inaugural database, they’ve analyzed men’s t-shirts, by washing, drying, measuring, and weighing an insane 800 of them. Threadbase’s findings, rendered in chart form, tell you that a size small Uniqlo crew neck shirt is the same size as a medium Alternative Apparel crew neck shirt, chest width-wise. They inform you that Alternative Apparel, Banana Republic, and H&M sell some of the shortest t-shirts out there. It also explains that with tees, weight—a sensory detail that can often evoke a sense of luxury—does not correlate to price. And much, much more. A t-shirt is a personal thing—a 2013 story in The New York Times Sunday Magazine said that 9 out of every 10 Americans clings to at least one old shirt for sentimental reasons.

The withheld payment has to do with copyrights over Hadid’s design. The Japan Sports Council wants them, and Hadid is refusing the hand them over. If she did, it would give the JSC license to use any element of her design, without any additional payment. It’s a confounding request, especially in light of the JSC’s very recent (and very public) decision to name Kengo Kuma as the stadium’s new architect. The stadium project has been mired in trouble from the start. In 2013, Japanese designers made noise by calling Hadid’s design too large, and even started a petition to halt construction. In 2014, Hadid and the JSC struggled to maintain a budget, and the cost of the stadium ballooned to a reported $2 billion. This summer, Tokyo killed it. In October, Hadid requested payment. In reply, the JSC sent documents, with the new copyright stipulations, to Hadid’s office. After the JSC chose Kuma and his design for the stadium, in December, Hadid’s firm issued a statement that mentions the “remarkable similarities of our original detailed stadium layout and our seating bowl configuration with those of the design announced today.” The timing of the different events—the JSC’s request to hand over copyrights in the fall, followed by Hadid’s accusations about copycatting in December—would suggest that Hadid and her team believe Tokyo to be using her design, under the guise of a new architect. Kuma, of course, has denied the accusation. Unfortunately for Hadid’s case, lots of stadiums are bowl-shaped, and that’s a building typology that you can’t protect under copyright. We recently spent some time unpacking the ins and outs of copyrighting architecture in this article, but cases such as this often boil down to a “total look and feel test,” in which a judge looks at two designs and asks, “do these things look substantially similar?” It’s a flimsy rule, and if you look at Hadid’s design and Kuma’s, it doesn’t look so good for the former.

The Pritzker is perhaps architecture’s most coveted and prestigious award. Recent winners have included Frei Otto, Shigeru Ban, and Toyo Ito. Less recent winners list industry celebrities like Zaha Hadid and Renzo Piano. At a time when architecture headlines tend to paint the industry as catering to the elite (see coverage of Jean Nouvel’s luxury condo tower in New York City’s midtown, or the scandal over Zaha Hadid’s now-scrapped $2 billion stadium for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics), it’s notable that the Pritzker Prize jury would choose an architect who seems to work very deliberately for the people. In a statement, Tom Pritzker, president and chairman of the Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award, said: “Alejandro Aravena has pioneered a collaborative practice that produces powerful works of architecture and also addresses key challenges of the 21st century. His built work gives economic opportunity to the less privileged, mitigates the effects of natural disasters, reduces energy consumption, and provides welcoming public space. Innovative and inspiring, he shows how architecture at its best can improve people’s lives.” Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Architecture Pritzker Prize Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Green, a young artist from the UK, actually created the animation a year ago, for Bowie’s 68th birthday. She called it “Time May Change Me” (you know, from Changes), and it comprises 29 colored pencil drawings of Bowie during various stages of his chameleon-like career. There’s Bowie as Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, and Major Tom. And then there’s Bowie as Bowie, visually reinvented again and again. Amidst the outpouring of mourning across the Internet, design and arts organizations are sharing it on Twitter, Instagram, and the like to honor his memory. Bowie was an artist—but he was also art, himself. There will be many visual tributes to the icon in the days to come, but Green’s homage, which celebrates Bowie’s capacity for reinvention and unabashed self-expression, strikes us as particularly fitting.

These remarkable hairstyles, perhaps most famously found atop the royal head of Marie Antoinette, were typically made from human, horse, or goat hair, and their voluminous height was boosted by padding and various other tools.  To solidify the style, a paste made from pig fat would be applied. Lovely. Buying a wig, one can imagine, was quite an investment in the 18th century. And indeed, a wig’s material and accessories were an outright display of wealth and status. The more elaborate your hair, the more elaborate your wealth. While hardly a practical accessory, the wigs were, objectively, works of art. And so, it makes sense that an art museum has decided to pay homage to them by creating a perfect time-suck of a website. The V&A of London just launched Design a Wig to celebrate the re-opening of its 1600—1815 galleries. The interactive website allows users to build a powdered wig wielding only a computer mouse. It’s as simple as grabbing the avatar’s shock of blonde hair and pulling it upward and outward to create a mushroom cloud. Powder your wig with digital flour of various hues. Add flowers, a sailboat, feathers! The wig is your oyster. Go crazy! And lest you feel bad about wasting 30 minutes of your employer’s time hypnotized by your newfound love of wig-making, just remind yourself: This isn’t a silly game; it’s a history lesson.   Go Back to Top.

And while atlases are technically just collections of maps (be they of roads, outer space, the world wide web, or the human body), the good ones also have a way of presenting a more holistic picture of the things they document. American Panorama, a cool new project from the University of Richmond’s Digital Scholarship Lab, is a great example. American Panorama aims to be an internet-era update to Charles’ Paullin’s sweeping Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States from 1932. It recounts America’s history through interactive cartography, letting users drag sliders and click on bubbles to take an even deeper dive into specific moments in history. American Panorama American Panorama comprises four maps created by design studio Stamen. And these maps have depth. Adding a layers of technology and interactivity to an otherwise daunting trove of data helps us make connections we might otherwise miss. For example, in a map that looks at the foreign-born population from 1850 to 2010, I was able to see that my ancestors’ arrival to Nebraska in the 1880s coincided with the influx of Swedish immigrants at the time. Dragging the scrubber along the dateline reveals how, a century later, the foreign-born population in the state was mostly Asian (the map explains that 1980 was the first time the country’s largest immigrant population was not European), and how, by 2010, European immigrants had been largely superseded by people from Latin America, Vietnam, China and Iraq. Paullin’s atlas examined the country’s social, economic and political history through a hyper-focused lens. The maps at American Panorama are similarly incisive, with titles like “Forced Migration of Enslaved People from 1810-1860,” “Canals from 1820-1860,” and “Overland Trails.” That there are currently just four maps to choose from means that—unless you’re a history buff—there’s probably a slight barrier to entry. And, if we’re being honest, these aren’t perfect data visualizations. The interaction is still a little clunky, and I found myself wanting to be able to drill down even deeper into the data. Despite all that, as American Panorama develops into a full-fledged digital atlas, it’s only going to become more powerful and compelling. Because as it turns out, the addition of even the simplest interactions can make it feel as though you’re looking at history with a very powerful magnifying glass in hand—and that’s a very cool thing.

In his review of 2015’s best book covers, Matt Dorfman, art director of The New York Times Book Review, describes that kind of work. “The covers that lure me into the pages,” he writes, “often do so by posing questions that I don’t want to ignore.” Rodrigo Corral and Zak Tebbal. What’s cool about this, at least right now, is that book cover designers seem to have more devices than ever at their disposal to pose these questions. There are certain rules, for sure, as master designer Peter Mendelsund—who has a design in this round up—has told us before. But designers can still thank Amazon and other e-outlets for this newfound liberation: because book covers often appear next to titles and the author name, designers are less beholden to promoting any kind of information hierarchy. To wit, if you scan the Times’s 12 picks for dust jackets, you’ll see that art, in the form of lavish illustrations, sometimes trumps legibility. Consider the excellent GIF cover for César Aira’s The Musical Brain. Designed by Rodrigo Corral and Zak Tebbal, it’s a killer merging of two technologies—one ancient, and one new. Go Back to Top.

Fjord is one such design firm. The company, which consulting firm Accenture bought in 2013, puts out an annual trends report to capture, in broad strokes, the topics designers should “expect to tackle in the coming year.” You’ll probably recognize some trends. The rise of voice recognition technology, virtual reality as an emerging medium, and the uptick in health data are developments that we’ve all talked a lot about this year. But embedded in the report are some burgeoning applications of good design that we’ve talked about a bit less. They’re worth mulling over. Take the “atomization of apps,” or the end of the standalone app. Omnipresent services are happening already—Fjord uses the example of Spotify, which exists as much on your laptop as it does in your Uber—but are likely to seep into other parts of our lives. From the paper: “Visa is researching the commerce-connected car that pays for groceries, takeaways and fuel—literally payments (and collection) on wheels.” There’s the rise in employee experience, or “EX”, design. “It was the fastest growing category of work at Fjord in 2015 across many industries, from banking to telecom to pharma,” says the report. When it comes to workplace tools like T&E reports or timesheets, even some progressive companies are woefully behind. To lure better talent from younger generations, businesses might want to pay attention to this decidedly unsexy category. There’s also a section called “For the people” that looks at how governments are finally embracing design for social good. Some of this has to do with introducing in-house design standards, but the report highlights ways agencies can work with citizens. Consider the Mobile Justice app, made in tandem with the Black Lives Matter movement: “The app has a simple feature allowing smartphone owners to send video footage directly to the American Civil Liberties Union—all with the simple shake of a phone. The ACLU then systematically reviews it for potential legal action.” Read the full report here. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Product Design UX design Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

By the end of the year, small owner-operators and larger commercial partners will begin using Otto's self-driving kit, Levandowski told Reuters at the facility in Concord, north of San Francisco, adding the company has a target of 'thousands' of testers by 2017. Scroll down for video  By the end of the year, small owner-operators and larger commercial partners will begin using Otto's self-driving kit developed by ex-Google employees. HOW OTTO DRIVES  Otto is aiming to equip trucks with software, sensors, lasers and cameras so they eventually will be able to navigate the more than 220,000 miles of U.S. highways on their own, while a human driver naps in the back of the cab or handles other tasks. For now, the robot truckers would only take control on the highways, leaving humans to handle the tougher task of wending through city streets.  Otto has not yet announced when the technology will be ready for sale. Launched in May, Otto focuses on maximizing the efficiency and safety of long-haul trucks, which spend much of their time on the side of the road as drivers rest. The Otto trucks are equipped with a series of sensors and mapping technology to allow them to gauge their position on highways and make real-time driving decisions. It's unknown just how Otto's partners will test the trucks, but Otto's vision allows the driver to leave the wheel, similar to a plane's 'autopilot' system. Many experts believe full self-driving technology will first roll out in the trucking sector, rather than in passenger cars.  Autonomous driving lends itself to highways, where trucks do not have to contend with pedestrians and the myriad distractions of city streets. Ron said trucks fitted with Otto software can drive more than double their normal daily mileage.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Homeward bound! Dogs can find their way over hundreds of... How Io has mountains that dwarf Everest: Giant isolated... Share this article Share The startup touts its technology as way to make up for a worsening shortage of truck drivers as more of them retire without enough younger drivers to replace them  'There is a very strong return on investment.' Since its launch, Otto has received hundreds of emails from mom-and-pop owner-operators around the country asking to use the technology, Ron said. Otto's staff has more than doubled to 90 employees from 40 in May, and the self-funded company now has a fleet of five test trucks. Picture an 18-wheel truck barreling down the highway with 80,000 pounds of cargo and no one but a robot at the wheel. To many, that might seem a frightening idea, even at a time when a few dozen of Google's driverless cars are cruising city streets in California, Texas, Washington and Arizona. But Anthony Levandowski, a robot-loving engineer who helped steer Google's self-driving technology, is convinced autonomous big rigs will be the next big thing on the road to a safer transportation system.  Levandowski left Google earlier this year to pursue his vision at Otto, a San Francisco startup the he co-founded with two other former Google employees, Lior Ron and Don Burnette, and another robotics expert, Claire Delaunay. Otto is aiming to equip trucks with software, sensors, lasers and cameras so they eventually will be able to navigate the more than 220,000 miles of U.S. highways on their own, while a human driver naps in the back of the cab or handles other tasks. For now, the robot truckers would only take control on the highways, leaving humans to handle the tougher task of wending through city streets.  Anthony Levandowski, a robot-loving engineer who helped steer Google's self-driving technology, is convinced autonomous big rigs will be the next big thing on the road to a safer transportation system The idea is similar to the automated pilots that fly jets at high altitudes while leaving the takeoffs and landings to humans. 'Our goal is to make trucks drive as humanly as possible, but with the reliability of machines,' Levandowski says. That objective probably won't be reached for decades, despite the progress made with automated passenger vehicles over the past five years, predicts Steven Shladover, program manager for mobility at the University of California's Partners for Advanced Transportation Technology. He maintains that the technology is still a long way from being reliable enough to convince government regulators that a robot can be entrusted to steer a truck traveling at highway speeds without causing a catastrophic accident. 'I don't want to be on that highway when there is nobody there to take over a truck with 80,000 pounds of cargo and I don't think I know anyone else who would want to be,'Shladover says.  Otto is aiming to equip trucks with software, sensors, lasers and cameras so they eventually will be able to navigate the more than 220,000 miles of U.S. highways on their own, while a human driver naps in the back of the cab or handles other tasks 'The consequences of any kind of failure in any component would be too severe.' Google's self-driving cars have logged about 1.6 million miles in autonomous mode without being involved in an accident that resulted in a deaths or major injuries.  Of the more than 20 accidents involving its self-driving cars Google has accepted the blame for only one — a February collision with a bus in Mountain View, California. It would be easier to brush off robot trucks as a far-fetched concept if not for Levandowski's background. Levandowski has been working on automated driving for more than a decade, starting in 2004 with a self-driving motorcycle called Ghostrider that is now in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.  He also designed PriBot, a self-driving Prius that crossed the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to deliver a pizza in 2008 before Google unveiled its fleet of autonomous cars. Sensors are seen on top of an Otto driverless truck at a garage in San Francisco Otto already has assembled a crew of about 40 employees experienced in self-driving cars to transplant the technology to trucks. With former employees from Google, Apple and Tesla Motors, Otto boasts that its team is made up of 'some of the sharpest minds in self-driving technology.' Although only four months old, Otto already has outfitted three big-rig cabs with its automated technology. The company completed its first extended test of its system on public highways in Nevada during the past weekend. Otto went to Nevada because California's self-driving regulations apply only to passenger cars, forbidding the technology from being used on public roads by commercial trucks or any vehicle exceeding 10,000 pounds. Now, Otto is looking for 1,000 truckers to volunteer to have self-driving kits installed on their cabs, at no cost, to help fine-tune the technology.  The volunteer truckers would still be expected to seize the wheel and take control of the truck if the technology fails or the driving conditions make it unsafe to remain in autonomous mode, mirroring the laws governing tests of self-driving cars on public streets and highways. Otto hasn't set a timetable for completing its tests, but hopes to eventually retrofit all the U.S. trucks on the road. That would encompass more than 4.7 million trucks, according to the American Trucking Associations. Levandowski has been working on automated driving for more than a decade, starting in 2004 with a self-driving motorcycle called Ghostrider that is now in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History The startup touts its technology as way to make up for a worsening shortage of truck drivers as more of them retire without enough younger drivers to replace them.  Last year, the shortage stood at 47,500 and, unless recent trends change, will rise to nearly 175,000 by 2024, according to the American Trucking Associations. Between 10 and 20 percent of the roughly 4,000 fatal accidents in the U.S. each year involving trucks and buses are linked to driver fatigue The trade group hasn't taken a stand on self-driving technology, but may draw up a policy later this year, said Dave Osiecki, executive vice president and chief of national advocacy. 'We are paying close attention because this could be huge for trucking in terms of labor costs and safety,' Osiecki says. Levandowski insists self-driving trucks aren't as scary as they might sound. Robot truckers are less likely to speed or continue to drive in unsafe conditions than a human, and will never get tired. Between 10 and 20 percent of the roughly 4,000 fatal accidents in the U.S. each year involving trucks and buses are linked to driver fatigue, based on estimates gathered by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. 'It's really silly to have a person steering a truck for eight hours just to keep it between two lines on the highway,' Levandowski says.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry.

The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive..

Are you curious to know why as of today, I'm a Chromebook guy? Read More . They’re perfect for students (I should know — I’m a recent graduate myself) because they’re cheap, light, fast, and do everything you need. Think of them as laptops that run only Google’s Chrome browser. That might sound limited, but you can type documents in Google Docs Zoho Writer vs. Google Docs & Microsoft Word Online: Is It Time to Switch?

Read More to your heart’s content — all for much less than an overpowered Windows laptop or MacBook. But once you’ve decided to go the Chromebook route, how do you choose which is best for you? Well, it depends on what you need. Here’s a list of the best Chromebooks for students in 2016. All-Around Best Chromebook If you’re looking for a middle-of-the-road Chromebook, check out the Toshiba Chromebook 2. It’s 13.3″, landing it square between the too-small 11.6″ Chromebooks and the too-big 15.6″ Chromebooks. It goes for about $300, making it neither the cheapest nor the most expensive Chromebook out there. Performance-wise, though, it has everything you need: a Full HD 1080p IPS display, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and a backlit keyboard. Its Celeron processor would be slow on a Windows computer, but Chromebooks are much less demanding, making this one of the fastest Chromebooks out there (you can even upgrade to an i3 processor if you want). Ads by Google If you’re not searching for anything in particular, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is a safe bet. Buy: Amazon ($469) All-Day Battery Life If you’re going to be at school all day, freedom from power outlets makes your life a lot easier. With a Chromebook, it’s easy to get all-day battery life and spend your time working outside, taking notes in class, and even writing essays that evening. The Asus C201 gets about 13 hours of battery life, which is amazing for any laptop or Chromebook. It also just happens to be one of the cheapest at $169 for the 2GB version (though the 4GB version is a little more expensive). The Google Store sells the C201 in Dark Blue, but you can find it on Amazon in Gold/Red or White/Light Blue. Its Rockchip processor isn’t the fastest, but it gets the job done. The little 11.6″ screen is only 720p, and the small size can make the keyboard feel cramped — but that also makes it inexpensive, lightweight, and super portable. If you want something that won’t weigh down your backpack and will last the whole day, definitely go with the Asus C201. Buy: Amazon ($170/£200) | Google Store ($169) ASUS C201PA-DS02 11.6 inch Chromebook (1.8GHz Quad-Core, 4GB LPDDR3, 16GB SSD), Navy Blue ASUS C201PA-DS02 11.6 inch Chromebook (1.8GHz Quad-Core, 4GB LPDDR3, 16GB SSD), Navy Blue Rockchip 1.8 GHz Processor Buy Now At Amazon $169.00 Touchscreen Hybrids If you’re tired of traditional laptops and want something that can double as a tablet, you have two great options capable of running Android apps, if you switch over to the developer channel. The first is the Asus Chromebook Flip — my personal Chromebook for the last year and one I couldn’t live without. I reviewed it a year ago ASUS Chromebook Flip Review and Giveaway ASUS Chromebook Flip Review and Giveaway Are you ready for a Chromebook with a touchscreen that also flips around to become a tablet? The ASUS Chromebook Flip brings the convenience and portability of a tablet with the keyboard of a laptop. Read More and loved it so much I bought one for myself. It’s a small 10.1″ device with a touchscreen that flips back on a 360-degree hinge so that you can use it in laptop mode, tent mode, presentation mode, or tablet mode. After using a touchscreen on a Chromebook, it’s so hard to go back. Why use the tiny trackpad when you can scroll using the whole screen? Plus, the tent and presentation modes are perfect for watching videos on an airplane or during a train ride. At $249 for the 2GB RAM version, it’s cheap, but not the cheapest, though thankfully, the 4GB upgrade is only $279 (or $249 from Amazon). Buy: Amazon ($300/£389) | Google Store ($249-$279) Your second touchscreen option is the Acer Chromebook R11. It has a faster Celeron processor, but no 4GB RAM option. It’s a little larger at 11.6″, which could give you a better typing experience, but the white casing looks cheaper than the silver Chromebook Flip. Otherwise, its 360-degree hinge design mirrors the Flip’s design. If 10.1″ is too small for you, go for the R11. Buy: Amazon ($270/£230) | Google Store ($249) Best Big Screen If all this talk of 10.1″ and 11.6″ screens has you cringing, don’t worry! Larger Chromebooks exist — the best of these is probably the Acer Chromebook 15. This one might be a little harder to fit in your backpack, but if you really can’t give up that screen real estate, it’s the way to go. The Chromebook 15 is pretty customizable, reaching from a 2GB RAM, HD screen, and 16GB storage configuration for $199 to a 4GB RAM, Full HD screen, and 32GB storage configuration for $349 — though prices are a little different on Amazon because it only offers the Full HD screen. With this Chromebook, you get a spacious keyboard and trackpad, as well as upward-facing speakers for improved audio quality. Those willing to lug around a nearly 5lb beast might appreciate its roomier typing experience.

It features the bare minimum specifications: 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, 720p HD screen, and a Celeron processor. It’s honestly not a bad device. It still has an IPS display and 9 hours of battery life. For being the cheapest device out there, it certainly could be much worse. For the most basic Chromebook that will let you get work done without breaking the bank, the Chromebook 11 should be your choice.

It's a touchscreen convertible with 12 hours of battery life, 3 USB 3.0 ports, and a good bit more nice features. I had never heard of CTL til about a month ago, but apparently they're very big in the education market, and they have a rather extensive product line so I don't think they're some fly-by-night operation. I've communicated a few times with a couple of their employees, and they seem to be pretty responsive, though I'll admit I'm going to wait until I see a review or two before I buy. I've never been a blind early adopter. :) Here's a link to the product site: http://ctl.net/laptops/ctl-j5-rugged-convertible-chromebook-tablet Can't wait to get it for public speaking purposes!

 Android is dominating the iPhone in India Mihai A., Phone Arena Aug. 5, 2016, 2:49 PM 1,132 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP A fresh report from market research firm Strategy Analytics reveals that Apple’s iPhone is struggling commercially in India. In the other corner of the boxing ring, Google's Android is in complete domination of the local smartphone market. Strategy Analytics estimates that 30.7 million smartphones were shipped in China during the second quarter of 2016, a healthy 19% improvement compared to the 25.8 million units shipped in Q2 2015. Allegedly, low smartphone penetration rates, a growing middle class, and intense local competition are the main drivers behind this growth. India is the world’s third-largest smartphone market, following China and the US. Out of the 30.7 million units shipped during Q2 2016, Strategy Analytics believes that 29.8 million of them (or an impressive 97%) run on Google’s Android. That’s good for a 28% improvement compared to same period last year. A year ago, Android held a 90% share of the Indian smartphone market, which now appears to be under Google’s full control. Naturally, since Android is enjoying unparalleled success in India, Apple’s iPhone isn’t doing very well in the country. The researchers estimate that Apple sold just 0.8 million iPhones during the quarter and only accounts for 2.4 of the Indian smartphone market. Back in Q2 2015, Apple is estimated to have sold 1.2 million units, good for a share of 4.5%. Apple’s main problem in India is the comparatively large price of its handsets. In a market where most smartphone sales are for low-cost handsets, Apple’s iPhone 6s was launched at an ultra-high price in the country. Back in late December, Apple notably slashed prices for its current-generation flagships, although it doesn't look like the aggressive move was enough to revitalize sales. The cheaper iPhone SE didn’t do much to boost Apple's local market share either. Apple has tried to improve its position in India through the sale of refurbished handsets. Thus far, however, these attempts have been halted by the Indian government. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

We rank all 16 Angry Birds games The 12 best Android TV games to play with a gamepad Five to Try: Her Story commands attention, and Google launches VR Expeditions Video Google Daydream View unboxing: A first look at Google's VR headset If your plans for the weekend revolve around a couch, the TV, and as much Olympics coverage as your eyes can handle, then you’re in luck: the official Rio 2016 app is here to help guide your days ahead. And the rest of the apps can also be enjoyed amidst that comfy cocoon of air-conditioned bliss… or anywhere else, really.  Mobius: Final Fantasy is Square Enix’s latest attempt to transform the role-playing epic into a free-to-play grind, while Google’s Verne: The Himalayas turns Google Maps into an educational journey. Also new this week is the non-beta release of Apple Music, along with the thrilling space escapes of All is Lost. Fire up the Play Store and grab a few new apps, no matter what your weekend plans are. Rio 2016 Rio 2016 is the official Olympics resource app, complete with adorable mascot in tow. A handful of soccer matches and archery events are already in the books, but tonight’s lavish opening ceremony marks the official start of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics. And if you plan on following the massive, international competition over the next couple weeks, you’ll probably want an app plastered on your home screen. Well, here’s Rio 2016. The official app, which is backed by Samsung but not limited to its devices, has all the Olympics info you need, including results, news, medal counts, and information on each sport, the players, and venues. It’s a pretty straightforward app, really, but it’ll get you all the info you need pretty easily—and if you’re down in Rio de Janeiro to scope out the action for yourself, the app has local info to enhance your stay. Mobius: Final Fantasy Mobius looks really nice at a glance, although everything’s pretty fuzzy up close. Mobius is quite seriously the third different Final Fantasy game to hit the Play Store over the last few weeks, and they’re all totally distinct. Final Fantasy VII is a premium port of a PlayStation classic, Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius is a new game inspired by the 16-bit era, and now Mobius: Final Fantasy is a combat-centric, free-to-play game that serves up the series spirit in a different form. You’ll find turn-based combat, fantasy spells, and even the familiar job system, although here the game simply routes you from battle to battle as you amass a deck of item and magic cards. Mobius doesn’t really play like a classic Final Fantasy, but it has the look of the more modern entries (and the convoluted storytelling), plus there are enough throwback references to appease the die-hards. We’ll see if that’s enough to hook longtime fans. Verne: The Himalayas Google’s digital mountain range is yours to explore in Verne: The Himalayas. It’s super cool to see some of the ways that Google has used its immense mapping power to deliver experiences for people who don’t need to leave the home. Treks are one result, showcasing amazing places around the world, and now Verne: The Himalayas is another way that Google is leveraging its Maps platform to spotlight somewhere amazing. Here, Verne takes the form of a kid-friendly app that lets you freely explore the 3D mountain range using a couple of digital control sticks. As you scale the cliffs, you’ll encounter narration bubbles and have the opportunity to soar on a hang-glider, for example, or sled down a hill. It’s just a breezy and fun way to learn about a new place, and the cartoonish yeti character and easy controls make it a good pick for the family. Apple Music Apple Music added videos and an equalizer—and ditched the beta branding. Nine months after first hitting the Play Store, Apple has finally decided to pull the beta tag off of Apple Music and call it a full release. The subscription service, which might seem a bit out of place on an Android phone, matches up well to Spotify on a lot of key features, save for maybe the biggest: it doesn’t have a free, ad-supported membership option. Still, there’s a 90-day free trial available to new subscribers. If you haven’t given it a look since the initial beta beginning, Apple Music has since added the missing music videos and now has equalizer settings, to boot. You’ll find millions of songs, of course, including an increasingly sizable stack of exclusives and the Beats 1 live radio station. Apple Music is about to get a major overhaul in iOS 10, but it’s unclear whether that will extend to Android as well. In the meantime, however, anyone scared off by Apple Music’s beta tag needn’t stay away now. All is Lost Can you get everyone out safely through these intense obstacle courses? All is Lost ($1) may not have the most upbeat title around, but it’s pretty entertaining all the same. This side-scrolling runner hails from the makers of Block Fortress and Heroes & Castles, and finds you in charge of guiding a series of crew members out of a doomed spaceship. Doing so requires an array of jumps, slides, and swipes to interact with the environment, and you’ll need to be speedy and precise to get everyone out. That’s not an easy task, of course, as the combinations of moves can throw you off, and you only have so many attempts for each crew member before they’re lost forever. All is Lost puts a clever twist on the usual format for these games, and while it may not have a ton of bells and whistles, the core experience is plenty fun.

Want to use open source software? Here we take an in-depth look at exactly how to do that. Read More , then Swiftnotes is your closest open source alternative. You can create notes, type up short blurbs, and give each entry its own color. In Swiftnotes, colors serve as tags. You can’t filter information, but you can quickly identify notes of the same color. Coordinate colors to separate shopping lists from doctor’s appointments and quotes for your history paper. A search function loads up notes that match keywords in the title or the body. Since Swiftnotes is running locally on your device, results pop up instantly. Ads by Google When the time comes to switch phones, you can backup all your notes and restore them later. This is not the same as syncing data across devices, but it doesn’t come with concerns over privacy or control either. Download: Swiftnotes for Android (F-Droid | Google Play) 2. Notepad Notepad doesn’t feel as polished as Swiftnotes, but it adds extra features for users who find the latter too basic. For starters, there’s basic formatting. You can make text bold, underline key words, or italicize distinctive phrases. This helps to differentiate words that would otherwise blend together. When that’s not enough, you can change text color. Your options are black, red, blue, green, or yellow. This app doesn’t stop with notes you type up. Sometimes a doodle gets the job done better. Here you can sketch a note or write with your fingertip. You won’t create works of art, but you can change the color and brush size. Download: Notepad for Android (F-Droid) 3. Floating Stickies Would you ever consider placing a sticky note on your monitor to help you remember? That could make you the kind of person who would love Floating Stickies. The app keeps a transparent sticky note on your screen at all times, so you don’t forget. I’ll admit, the idea of this app would have driven me up the wall before. How can I use an app when a sticky note is taking up part of the screen? And this is a mobile app — it’s not like there’s much room to work with! But now I find this app to be a great way to remember important things. I’m going to check my phone at several points throughout the day, and a floating sticky note will make sure I don’t forget what we need from the store. Sticky notes aren’t only good for to-do lists. I use one as a reminder to stay positive or to carry around a phrase I read in a book that I want to commit to memory. Notes turn transparent when not in use, so you can always see what’s underneath. Stickies cycle between one of three colors. As for options, there are none. Like real-life sticky notes, the beauty is in the simplicity. There’s a reason people keep making apps like this Post-It To Your Screen - 6 Sticky Note Apps For Windows Post-It To Your Screen - 6 Sticky Note Apps For Windows Post-its on your desktop or Start Screen can be extremely helpful for remembering small but important amounts of information. Stop cluttering up your desk and go digital with these fantastic sticky note apps. Read More . That aside, I wouldn’t use Floating Stickies for jotting down anything long. You’ll want a different app for that. Download: Floating Stickies for Android (F-Droid | Google Play) 4. uNote uNote isn’t the prettiest app. The interface does the bare minimal to feel modern, but not everyone needs their notes to look like Post-Its. uNote’s notes each have a title and a body. There’s no formatting, doodling, or any other way to spice things up. Each entry appears in a straightforward list. As boring as that sounds, there are reasons to check this app out. One is the option to search notes by title and content. Another is the inclusion of both creation date and modification date, so you know when you made each entry. Then there’s the ability to password protect each note. Not only that, you can set individual passwords. If you want an extra layer of privacy, this may be the way to go. Download: uNote for Android (F-Droid | Google Play) 5. Writeily Pro Maybe you take serious notes. Some of these apps will work, but they’re less than ideal. When you’re poking out lengthy, heavily-formatted documents from your phone, you need something with a bit more umph. Writeily Pro lets you write in plain text and markdown. The latter gives you much of the capability you would expect from a word processor What Is Markdown? 4 Reasons Why You Should Learn It Now What Is Markdown? 4 Reasons Why You Should Learn It Now Tired of HTML and WYSIWYG editors? Then Markdown is the answer for you no matter who you are. Read More . We’re not talking only bolding, underlining, and italicizing. You can create both bulleted and numbered lists. Then add hyperlinks to websites you want to remember. Markdown is a great way to write for the web. When you’re done with a note, you can export to plain text, HTML, or an image. Then you can upload it to a blog. The app intends for you to create a bunch of notes, so you have the option to make folders. And like with uNote, you can shield your notes from nosy individuals. This time you use a PIN instead of a traditional password. Download: Writeily Pro for Android (F-Droid | Google Play) Which Is Write for You? Pardon the absolutely terrible pun. I tried. Maybe you can write down a few suggestions using any of the apps above and get back to me with your best ones. While you’re at it, which app do you like best? Is there another open source option that I’ve missed? Let me know! And if you’re contemplating replacing all your Android apps with open source alternatives, here are twelve of the best 12 Best Free and Open Source Android Apps 12 Best Free and Open Source Android Apps Are you an open source enthusiast? Then you'll love these apps for your Android phone or tablet. Read More .

Reply Nick August 6, 2016 at 3:32 am Omni notes is my go to note app, open source too. Reply HildyJ August 6, 2016 at 12:24 am If you want to take notes and read them on multiple devices or take notes just on your phone with no worries about security, I recommend KeePass. It was originally designed as a password manager but it includes a note section in each entry which allows free form text. The entire file of entries is password protected and locally encrypted. You can store it in Dropbox without worries. I use it for notes like my familiy's SSNs as well as passwords. Go to the KeePass website ( http://keepass.info/index.html ) for more info and for ports for various phones (I use KeePass2Android). That said, for most notes I find Keep to be just to convenient to ignore. From sharing a grocery list to photographing model and serial numbers to generating reminders, Google does it right.I only wish they'd let me display just the titles and add sort and search to lists.

Amazon, Google, and SiriusXM are making it even simpler this year with voice commands, search options, and live streaming. By Brandon Vigliarolo | August 5, 2016, 9:45 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/masterSergeant What's Hot at TechRepublic The antique computers that just won't quit Windows 10: The Sirius A is a full desktop PC that fits in your pocket If there's a tech skills shortage, why are so many computer graduates unemployed? Subscribe to TechRepublic's Tech News You Can Use newsletter There's been a four-year wait for the 2016 Rio Olympics, but today's the day: the torch will be lit, the games will officially open, and there will be a media frenzy to get breaking information and news about the world's largest sporting event. Tech has changed a lot in four years, and what better place to see the latest innovations than the Olympics? Voice your questions with Amazon Echo, stream with Fire TV We're all on the go, and the games wait for no one. There's a good chance you're going to miss a lot of the action, but that doesn't mean you have to wait to find out who's won the gold. Amazon is turning the Echo into an Olympics results powerhouse so that you can get all the news you want exactly when you want it. SEE: Tech giants take over the 2016 Olympics, here's what your company can learn (TechRepublic) A whole bunch of Olympics-related commands are being added to Echo's Alexa voice command system. You can ask general things like "what are the Olympic medal standings?" to get a count of the overall results, as well as things like "how many gold medals does the USA have?" to get specific results. Amazon has also added the ability to ask event-specific questions about winners, schedules, and recaps. If you've cut the cable TV cord for pure internet streaming the Fire TV and Fire TV Stick will allow you to watch the games. The NBC Sports and Sling TV apps are both streaming the Olympics, and both apps are available free on the Amazon App Store. Dive deep with Google's detailed results The Echo and your Fire TV aren't exactly as portable as a smartphone, but don't worry: Google has you covered. Olympic-related searches will turn up specialized info, as well as links to highlight videos and news stories. As a bonus, searching within the Google app on iOS or Android adds the option to get mobile notifications for your search query. SEE: Visa is about to put a ring on it (TechRepublic) Google is also using YouTube and mapping tech to give Olympic fans direct access to the games. YouTube is sending 15 of its top Creators to Rio to live stream the games. There's also new street view mapping of Rio, and even backpack mapping of the Olympic park itself. You might not be able to get to the games, but Google is trying to give you an immersive experience. SiriusXM: 24-hour coverage SiriusXM subscribers will be able to follow the games 24 hours a day on channel 106, but don't assume you're going to be able to tune in to every single game: they're focusing on live coverage of Team USA basketball and soccer. The SiriusXM Olympic channel will feature a nightly recap called Tonight in Rio, so you'll still be able to get an update if you want to stay up from 10:00 p.m. eastern until midnight to get the news. Prefer Olympic coverage in app form? If Echo, Google searches, and digital radio aren't your thing you can always keep up on the latest Olympic news with these 10 Olympic apps.

Well, instead of the world’s most depressing screen, the app will now show you your standard Google Now cards. As seen in the screenshots above, Googe will bring up several quick shortcuts to do things like creating alarms, events, timers, and reminders. Beneath that is a quick access bar to several Google Maps categories for finding gas stations, cafes, bars, restaurants, ATMs, and shopping areas. Beneath all that are your Google Now cards (which will obviously differ for each person based on their interests and upcoming events). This feature alongside the ability to select the exact text you want Google Now on Tap to look for go a very long way toward making it more of a useful tool than a novelty. The changes are live in the beta version of the Google app on Google Play, so be sure to get yourself updated ASAP. local_offer    Google  Google Now  Google Now on Tap   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (1) stars Further Reading Verizon offering Pixel for $10 a month DEAL: Google is dropping $30 off of Googel Home Google WiFi may be the best router Google updates the YouTube app with a new icon and more Google Shops are launching in Canada and the UK stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertPokémon GO makes big changes CP levels closePokémon GO is making big changes to the CP levels of your favorite Pokémon Pokemon GO is bring big changes to the balancing of the game by tweaking the CP levels of some of your favorite Pokemon (for better or worse). 2 more_vertHTC may exit the mobile smartphone market closeHTC may be looking to get out of the smartphone business A new rumor suggests that HTC may be planning to sell off its mobile division due to suffering too many losses. 3 more_vertDitto is now live in Pokémon GO, here's how to catch him closeDitto is officially live in Pokémon GO, here’s how to catch him Today, Niantic has officially released Ditto into the augmented wilds of Pokemon GO.

 Here's why Google sees a huge opportunity to bring super-fast internet access to you Matt Rosoff Aug. 5, 2016, 1:33 PM 3,045 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Google's parent company Alphabet has an audacious plan to bring super-fast fiber-based internet access to a lot more of the United States. And there's certainly room for improvement. As this chart from Statista shows, the U.S. lags way behind most other developed countries when it comes to fiber broadband. Part of the problem is simply that the U.S. is much geographically larger and more spread out than any of these countries, which creates logistical challenges when it comes to running fiber to every home. But Alphabet's Access and Energy group also believes that the cable and telco companies who dominate internet access today have no particular incentive to build fiber out any faster, as most Americans have been stuck with one or two local providers.  Statista SEE ALSO: The Apple App Store has been a bonanza for app developers NOW WATCH: How to choose the best cut of steak — according to Anthony Bourdain Loading video...

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google is expected to sell its new Nexus smartphones, allegedly codenamed Marlin and Sailfish, directly to shoppers, but it turns out the devices might also be available from one major carrier. A new rumor claims Verizon will carry the HTC-made stock Android handsets as well. Verizon is going to carry the two "Nexus" handsets (note the quotation marks). — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 5, 2016 The leak comes from Evan Blass, who has a good track record when it comes to mobile leaks. Blass doesn’t reveal very much in his latest tip. The quotation marks around “Nexus” seem to suggest Verizon’s version of the rumored smartphones won’t really count as pure Nexus devices, possibly due to carrier bloatware and less reliable software updates. That’s essentially what happened with Verizon’s Galaxy Nexus, and it sounds like history may repeat itself later this year. Google will likely still offer the Nexus Marlin and Sailfish directly to customers, so it’s unclear what advantages a Verizon variant might offer. The carrier could sell the devices on a payment plan instead of charging the full price upfront like Google typically does. That alone may win some shoppers over. The new Nexus phones are expected to pack plenty of power, especially the high-end Marlin model. The rumored metal smartphone will allegedly offer a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, a 3450mAh battery, a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a rear fingerprint reader and Android Nougat software. The smaller Sailfish could sport similar specs with a 5-inch 1080p display and a 2770mAh battery in a plastic shell. Both devices are reportedly set to launch later this year, likely sometime this fall when the new Nexus lineup typically hits the scene. If Verizon really is set to offer a carrier variant, we’ll probably see it released at around the same time.

To help you make the most of that last, great summer road trip, we've compiled a list of tips to get more out of Google Maps. Here are some useful features hiding just below the surface. Hayley TsukayamaThe Washington Post · Google Maps consistently makes lists of the top 10 most-used apps and is probably one app that many people consult daily. But how much of the program do you actually use? Those who just type in an address and go should know that there's so much more you can do than just that. To help you make the most of that last, great summer road trip, we've compiled a list of tips to get more out of Google Maps. Here are some useful features hiding just below the surface. - Multistop trips: Trips aren't always about going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes there's a C, D, E or even F you have to get to as well. Google recently started rolling out a new feature that lets you plug in more than one destination at a time. - Use "explore": The "Explore" section of Maps is pretty easy to find, but is probably overlooked by those focused on just getting directions. The feature is particularly useful if you're traveling on business or to a new place and need to grab a quick bite to eat, and don't have time to wander around aimlessly. From the main search screen, click on the three parallel lines on the left-hand side of the search bar. (Designers call this common icon the "hamburger.") If you're zoomed into a reasonably local area, you should see the "Explore" section, which will direct you to good places to eat, cheap places to eat, nearby attractions and more. - Download an offline area: If you're going to be somewhere where you can't get cell service, take advantage of the ability to download a section of Google Maps to access offline. To do this tap in the search bar and scroll down until you see "Download a new offline area." Alternatively, you can search for a city and swipe up from the bottom, and then hit the "Download" option. Google won't let you download too large of an area - but you can go up to 120,000 square kilometers. You can interact with this offline section of the map and search for directions to locations within that part of the world. Maps won't suggest places for you, but it will still be more useful than an old-school map. - Share directions: Need to let someone else know how to get to where they're going? Once you have the directions you need, hit the three-dot options menu and tap "Share Directions." That will let you text or email directions to someone through a link, or even share directions over Twitter or Facebook if you so desire. That's way easier than reading your phone's screen to someone, or trying to remember off the top of your head. Besides, your friends are probably just going to put the destination in Google Maps anyway. This feature can save both of you the trouble. - Sign-in for better service: If you're signed in to Maps it adds quite a bit of functionality - though you're also giving Google's app more access to your information. Deciding whether the trade-off is worth it is up to you. If you sign in and turn on your history, from that point you'll be able to reference your past destinations more quickly. So, if you get a restaurant recommendation for a summer trip and then want to go back the following summer, you should be able to do that quickly. Another advantage to signing in is that you can link your Google Contacts to Google Maps, so it's easy to find your friend Jim's house by pulling it from your address book. That saves you from having to ask "Where am I going, again?" when you get in the car. You can sign in to your Google Account by hitting the hamburger icon and tapping "Sign in."

By Andrew Brust for Big on Data | August 5, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics In October of last year, I wrote about 14 different big data acquisitions that had taken place. In that article, I grouped the deals and picked out some trends. In some cases, the acquiring companies were building out their clouds. In another case, a traditional data warehouse vendor added big data technology to its stack. In another instance, private equity stepped in; open source companies went commercial in a couple more. To round things out, a financial risk management company and a media company each acquired analytics technology companies of their own. Also read: 14 Big Data acquisitions and why they happened Since I wrote that article, several other deals have been announced. Microsoft scooped up Metanautix in December, SAP bought Roambi in February, and Tableau acquired HyPer in March. Just last month, Teradata announced it bought UK firm Big Data Partnership, and Workday announced it would acquire Platfora. Also read: Microsoft acquires big-data analytics vendor Metanautix Also read: Tableau buys HyPer, to add R&D center in Munich Also read: Workday plans for Platfora revealed Before going further, and in the interest of full disclosure, I should point out that in addition to my work with ZDNet, I am Senior Director of Market Strategy and Intelligence at Datameer, an erstwhile competitor of Platfora's. With that in mind, I'm going to talk about the Workday-Platfora deal only at a high-level. Let's look at the following five deals. At first blush, they will each seem pretty different from one another, but there's a broad theme that ties them together. M&M Microsoft's acquisition of Metanautix would seem to be around the latter company's "Quest" product, and its ability to provide a uniform SQL interface to a great many data stores. Like Google's Dremel technology, as well as Apache Drill, Quest provided a SQL-on-Anything gateway that could have obvious utility within the entire Cortana Intelligence Suite. Quest could query documents and files, in addition to databases. So, with a little imagination, one could even see it being used to power "bot" interfaces to Microsoft Office. Buying the company also let Microsoft re-hire someone who was among Google's data cognoscenti: Metanautix CEO Theo Vassilakis. The original Dremel paper was co-authored by Vassilakis while he was at Google, prior to starting Metanautix. Vassilakis is now Azure Data Partner Development Manager at Microsoft; he also worked for Microsoft Research before his tenure at Google. Tableau gets HyPer Microsoft isn't the only company to acquire an engine and hire some talent in the process. Tableau's acquisition of HyPer gives it access to key in-memory hybrid OLAP/OLTP database technology that it may wish to use to make its product faster. That said, it also may have been an aqui-hire, in an effort to build out an engineering presence in Europe (HyPer was a German company). SAP roams by SAP's acquisition of Roambi has some interesting inner loops to it. The company was founded as MeLLmo by a team that included co-founders of Xcelsius, a data visualization company and product that Business Objects acquired in 2006. SAP announced its acquisition of Business Objects in 2007 and closed the deal in 2008, bringing Xcelsius under the SAP umbrella. Under SAP ownership, Xcelsius seems to have been put out to pasture, having morphed into something called SAP Crystal Dashboard Design. But the Roambi acquisition would appear to be SAP's second chance at the Xcelsius/MeLLmo team's data viz technology. Roambi was focused exclusively on delivering data visualization on mobile devices. The output was beautiful, but the niche opportunity less so. SAP didn't disclose terms of the deal, but there were rumors that it was an asset buy and that the sale price was quite low. Meanwhile, if you think about SAP's flagship ERP business, having a great mobile visualization story -- and grabbing it for a bargain price -- makes a lot of sense. The ERP-analytics plot thickens That theme of adding visual analytics to Enterprise software would seem to carry over to the Workday-Platfora deal as well. Analytics can be most powerful when its embedded -- so for a major software company to want to own and embed significant analytics IP seems quite logical. Zendesk's acquisition of BI software vendor BIME Analytics, which I covered in my October article, would seem to fit into this grouping as well. Teradata wants service Teradata's acquisition of London-based Big Data Partnership seems a bit less straightforward. Of course, Teradata has already done a number of deals; I covered three of them in my October article. An earlier Teradata acquisition, in late 2014, was of big data consultancy Think Big Analytics, and the Big Data Partnership deal fits in with that very nicely. In fact, Big Data Partnership has been formally folded into Think Big. Why would Teradata execute a services play not just once, but twice? Ultimately, it would seem to come down to Enterprise sales. Implementing big data -- and doing it successfully -- is still hard, and experienced consulting shops/Systems Integrators (SIs) can make enterprise customers feel a lot more confident moving forward with it. That puts them in the perfect position to recommend tools and technologies. So, having a manageably small, but geographically distributed, services organization can be very helpful to Teradata indeed. Enterprise starship Looking back on the various deals we've discussed here, it seems the common thread for all but one of them is the enterprise. Whether the enterprise cloud, in the case of Microsoft Azure, enterprise software, in the case of SAP and Workday, or enterprise consulting and sales, in the case of Teradata, four of the five deals we've looked at seem to have enterprise stamped all over them. Software companies that want growth have to become companies that serve the Enterprise. So why doesn't the Tableau-HyPer deal really fit the pattern? I'm not sure, but I do think a lack of enterprise focus at least partially explains why Tableau has missed its earnings targets for three consecutive quarters now. Also read: Tableau posts mixed Q2 results but continues to attract new customers Maybe Tableau's next play should target the enterprise too. Correction: this post originally stated that Tableau had missed its revenue targets for three consecutive quarters. It was updated to state that it missed its earnings targets over that period. It's not about what Obama says, it's what enterprises must do Administration's ongoing cybersecurity efforts will get revision next week, but what is still missing are details and progress Read More Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories Big Data Analytics Cronulla Sharks chose the data-driven road to an NRL grand final victory Big Data Analytics Visibrain launches monitoring platform for brand reputation management Big Data Analytics BOM gets Cray supercomputer for weather prediction Big Data Analytics Is Google Cloud Machine Learning enterprise-ready? × Thank You Please review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription I agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Video Services Policy.

But how much of the program do you actually use? Those who just type in an address and go should know that there’s so much more you can do than just that. To help you make the most of that last, great summer road trip, we’ve compiled a list of tips to get more out of Google Maps. Here are some useful features hiding just below the surface. ∙ Multistop trips: Trips aren’t always about going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes there’s a C, D, E or even F you have to get to as well. Google recently started rolling out a new feature that lets you plug in more than one destination at a time. Users can access this by hitting the options menu from the directions screen — you get there by hitting the three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner — and selecting “Add stop.” Keep in mind that you may not see this update yet. ∙ Use “explore”: The “Explore” section of Maps is pretty easy to find, but is probably overlooked by those focused on just getting directions. The feature is particularly useful if you’re traveling on business or to a new place and need to grab a quick bite to eat, and don’t have time to wander around aimlessly. From the main search screen, click on the three parallel lines on the left-hand side of the search bar. (Designers call this common icon the “hamburger.”) If you’re zoomed into a reasonably local area, you should see the “Explore” section, which will direct you to good places to eat, cheap places to eat, nearby attractions and more. ∙ Download an offline area: If you’re going to be somewhere where you can’t get cell service, take advantage of the ability to download a section of Google Maps to access offline. To do this tap in the search bar and scroll down until you see “Download a new offline area.” Alternatively, you can search for a city and swipe up from the bottom, and then hit the “Download” option. Google won’t let you download too large of an area — but you can go up to 120,000 square kilometers. You can interact with this offline section of the map and search for directions to locations within that part of the world. Maps won’t suggest places for you, but it will still be more useful than an old-school map. You should know that if you download a part of Google Maps, it will take up storage space on your phone. But it can be convenient, and it’s way easier to transport than a paper map that you’ll never be able to refold again. ∙ Share directions: Need to let someone else know how to get to where they’re going? Once you have the directions you need, hit the three-dot options menu and tap “Share Directions.” That will let you text or email directions to someone through a link, or even share directions over social media if you so desire. That’s way easier than reading your phone’s screen to someone, or trying to remember off the top of your head. Besides, your friends are probably just going to put the destination in Google Maps anyway. This feature can save both of you the trouble. ∙ Sign-in for better service: If you’re signed in to Maps it adds quite a bit of functionality — though you’re also giving Google’s app more access to your information. Deciding whether the trade-off is worth it is up to you. If you sign in and turn on your history, from that point you’ll be able to reference your past destinations more quickly. So, if you get a restaurant recommendation for a summer trip and then want to go back the following summer, you should be able to do that quickly. Another advantage to signing in is that you can link your Google Contacts to Google Maps, so it’s easy to find your friend Jim’s house by pulling it from your address book. That saves you from having to ask “Where am I going, again?” when you get in the car. You can sign in to your Google Account by hitting the hamburger icon and tapping “Sign in.” ∙ Know more about what you’re getting into: There are also some settings that most users know about but likely don’t use that often. On the options menu, for example, you can turn on different filters and features to get different information about where you’re headed. If you’re walking in a hilly city such as San Francisco, for example, you may really want to see the terrain around you. A coffee shop may look like it’s just a quick walk and a few blocks away — but those blocks may take you straight up a steep hill. That’s vital information to know if you don’t want to be out of breath by the time you get there. One setting I use a lot that many may find useful is the setting preference to “avoid tolls.” Of course, you can’t always find a toll-free way to get somewhere in the time you need, but it’s still nice to have the option on hand.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Snapchat is funny. On the one hand, it has 150 million users watching 10 billion videos a day. When the first Republican primary debate aired on television, twice as many 18-to-24-year-olds got their coverage from Snapchat than from the TV broadcast. On the other hand: face swaps, puppy noses and rainbow vomit. The still privately held company started selling ads a little over a year ago, and has been developing content partnerships with companies like CNN, Cosmopolitan, BuzzFeed and Vice since January 2015. Snapchat offers channels to parade their stuff in front of new media’s youngest active demographic. Celebrities have jumped on board, and are snapping their fabulous lives; there’s one of the rich kids of Instagram; and fashion trend setters have recently started noticing there’s a new mirror in town in which to gaze at themselves. It’s clearly the next big thing, if not already the big thing, but you’d still be forgiven for thinking that the four-year-old tech star hasn’t quite figured out what it is, let alone how to cash in. That’s why the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro could be a turning point for Snapchat – and Snapchat could be part of a turning point for Rio and the Olympics themselves. The stories we’ve been hearing are mostly true. The city’s subway expansion didn’t open until August 1, with all of four days to spare before the Games and very little time to figure out if it works properly. The triathlon water that was supposed to be cleaned up will be only half as free of sewage as was promised. And complaints about the disrepair of the athletes’ village began as soon as federations began arriving last week. But it could be that this is not the real story of these Games. The Olympics have, at least since Montreal in 1976, been sold to locals as an excuse to fast-track physical infrastructure. Squaw Valley, California (1960) and Calgary (1988) still have some of the world’s best winter sport resort and training facilities. Barcelona (1992) got more than 3 km of new beach, Nagano (1998) got a bullet train, Sydney (2000) got a 640-hectare park and Athens (2004) got a better airport and a subway system. But Rio may be the first Olympics whose primary legacy will be digital. Google, for instance, decided to use the Olympics as an excuse to finally map many of the favelas – slums – where as many as one in five cariocas live. This is a big deal, probably bigger than the subway and the poop-filled water combined. Google also decided to make Rio one of the world’s 10 YouTube studio cities, alongside Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo and London (and Toronto! Who knew?). It’s transforming a railway warehouse into a sort of YouTube incubator, providing YouTubers – that odd group of people who use the Google-owned video platform as their main form of expression (and sometimes income) – with tools to expand their horizons. They’ll be using CGI and music in a studio space to create more ambitious pieces. Joining Sao Paulo as the only such studios in South America or the Lusophone world, it’s poised to make Rio a hub for future video development. Already, 18-49-year-olds watch more YouTube on mobile video than any cable TV network, and advertising spending, while flat lining around five per cent growth for TV, is growing upwards of 16 per cent for digital media. YouTube’s partner revenue is up 50 per cent this year over last. Though we may not have noticed it, YouTube probably already is the new TV, and cities with YouTube Studios have the potential to end up being to this new world – in a more international, dispersed way of course – what New York and L.A. were for the TV world. Some technology (print, steam engines) is revolutionary; other technology (robotics, supersonic travel) only looks that way to begin with. When technology is very new, before it’s declared itself, it can be fun to try to figure out which of these it is, and whether or not the revolution is for us. Snapchat is there now, and the Rio Olympics may be the place where it gets decided. ______ While getting a tour of the Olympic Park, about 40 minutes outside the city core in a newly developed neighbourhood called Barra da Tijuco, I spoke with Adriana Garcia, the head of digital communications for Rio 2016. She was being generally candid, as I found all the Olympic officials I spoke with to be (the head of athletics told me not to expect the Rio games to be “deluxe” like London). She acknowledged the problems of putting together such a big event in a city in crisis. “Rio is melting,” were her words. I asked her how, with things like Facebook Live, Rio expected to be able to maintain the broadcast exclusivity upon which so much of its sponsorship money depends. It turns out they’ve got deals with Facebook and YouTube to take down any unauthorized video posted from the events. “But Snapchat,” she said, “there is no way to block that.” Because of its basic model – instant, unmoderated video uploads – there’s really no way for anyone to stop anyone with Snapchat from posting anything they want. This may not end up being that big of a deal. Snapchat’s basic demographic is 13-to-17-year-olds (only 14 per cent of users are 35 and over), a group that doesn’t traditionally make a large showing in the stands. But looked at from another angle, it could also be enormous for both Snapchat and the Olympics. If people figure out that this is the only way they can broadcast, giving their followers some of that look-where-I-am taste Snapchat is so good at, it could radically expand that demographic outwards and upwards among Games-goers, and if people end up being creative with their snap stories – as they have been at sports events in the past, splicing together videos from multiple perspectives, for instance – it could poke a hole right through those mega-million-dollar network deals. Would people rather watch interminable qualifying events on TV, or see the best bits through the lens of their best friends and favourite Snapchatters? Instagram, owned by YouTube, seems to have been asking itself the same question, and in addition to doing a parent-company deal with the Olympics, it has just announced a “stories” feature that is openly trying to emulate the basic way Snapchatters put their snaps together. What does all this mean for the value of those TV deals, and the money those deals provide for all the perks IOC members like so much? TV networks have increasingly relied on the draw of these exclusive event deals to bolster their flagging fortunes in the face of challenges from directions they didn’t even know existed. If Snapchat becomes a Trojan horse at these Olympics, there could be some very sad faces at 30 Rock and in Burbank this month. Snapchat is in one of those exciting interstitial periods right now. It’s big, it’s doing something new and it’s still privately held. No one knows how much money it’s making – if any (though estimates are it made US$59 million in 2015) – or what its plans are. Is it just ramping up to sell itself to Google or Facebook? Or is it looking to become a Google or Facebook? YouTube and, briefly, Vine became new ways for people to tell stories visually, to share information, to make news. Snapchat is relatively new to the game, but 13-to-17-year-olds won’t stay that age forever, and as these native Snapchatters grow up, and continue getting more ambitious and creative, the platform will grow with them. As a result, it’s possible Snapchat could eat a good deal more of traditional broadcasting’s already largely eaten lunch. There are signs that Snapchat is looking to grow up. It has signed a deal with NBC, for instance, to re-purpose some of the old broadcaster’s material into a Snapchat channel. (NBCUniversal has invested US$200 million in Snapchat.) It has a similar Olympic deal with Australia’s largest media company, Seven West. Like pretty much every other form of media since moving pictures, Snapchat got its start as a form of pornography. Its disappearing videos were largely given over to bathroom mirror shots of teenage junk. But before long, it became another new way to communicate. Unlike Facebook and MySpace before it, Snapchat offers people a fresh start every day. If someone follows you, they only see who you are from that point on, not who you were last year, last month or even last week. This may seem unimportant to many adults, but to middle- and high-schoolers, living accelerated lives in which you can go from dud to stud in days, identity without context can be a valuable thing. As the demographic inevitably ages, this same approach could bypass the Facebook- and Twitter-resumé dilemma, helping people looking for work craft their images rather than having to scrub their social media presence or be saddled with evidence of just how much they drank and smoked in school. Much as it pains a writer to say so, the immediate future of communication and storytelling seems to be visual. Vine’s format has often proven to be too restrictive (only a handful of users – Zach King, Ian Padgham, Jethro Ames – ever really cracked it beyond a single viral clip), and YouTube, with those big-budget studio spaces raising the ante for every indie maker, seems destined to join Netflix as the next TV. But Snapchat, at least for the moment, is nestled in the space between. It’s still an outsider, tight-lipped and focused, with a medium just restrictive enough to foster the sort of creativity that could make it unique and outstanding. Another thing that has separated Snapchat from Facebook Live, et al. is that the app did not take itself too seriously – at least to begin with – and things like stickers and lenses (those puppy noses and rainbow barfs) and the ability to draw on pictures with your finger mean that users can have fun with the form as well as the content. The latest trend has users drawing themselves into celebrity selfies, and big Snapchatter Arnold Schwarzenegger (Snapchat: arnoldschnitzel) has fun doing things like putting Terminator filters on James Cameron when they meet at a party. It doesn’t take much imagination to see how the same tools could be used to make Snapchat a good deal more artistic and pointedly political than other popular platforms could ever hope to be. YouTube is as powerful as it is in part because it lets anyone with a phone be a broadcaster. Snapchat lets anyone with a phone be a political cartoonist and lo-fi CGI artist as well.

But this has been a year of surprises. Nonetheless, I’d keep my eye on Rio. You can bet Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg will be.

Apple is taking a beating in India, the world's third-largest smartphone market. Total handset shipments in the country grew 19 percent annually to 31 million units during the second quarter of 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Unfortunately for Cupertino, a record 97 percent of those sales were Android devices. Google's mobile operating system maintained its first-place position during the period, dominating the market. The popular OS shipped 29.8 million units in India in the second quarter, growing 28 percent annually from the the year before. "Android … looks unbeatable right now, due to its deep portfolio of hardware partners, extensive distribution channels, and a wide range of low-cost apps like Gmail," Neil Mawston, Strategy Analytics' executive director, said in a statement. Behind China and the US, India's smartphone market is growing rapidly, due primarily to low smartphone penetration rates; an expanding middle class with more disposable income; and competition among major vendors, retailers, and operators, according to senior analyst Rajeev Nair. Apple, meanwhile, took a 35 percent dive, shipping only 0.8 million smartphones in India in Q2. //Related Articles Why Apple Needs to Fast Track an iPhone Launch in India The tech titan, which recently celebrated its billionth iPhone sale, also lags behind Android in the rest of the world: Strategy Analytics tipped a 15 percent dip in global shipments during the second quarter. Things could change, though, by the end of the year. While Samsung just launched its flagship Galaxy Note 7, Apple is also likely to introduce a new iPhone lineup this fall. "Apple ... will need to reduce iPhone pricing to cheaper levels, attract more operator subsidies and enlarge its retail presence through Apple stores or online channels if it wants to regrow significantly in the future," Strategy Analytics Director Woody Oh said of the company's potential in India.

The Nexus Sailfish and Marlin are two other flagship Android handsets that some users can’t wait to see in stores. A new report reveals even more details about Google's next-gen smartphones, with a special focus on the Marlin, which will be the bigger, more expensive, version of the two. DON’T MISS: The only bad cell company is Sprint After Android Police had revealed a bunch of details regarding the phones’ design, hardware, and unique software features, Nate Benis posted on Google+ a list of new tidbits concerning Google’s Nexus plans for this year. According to Benis, Google will partner with carriers to sell the new phones. AT&T and Verizon are specifically mentioned, with the latter being “guaranteed” to have the phone in stores. Benis also listed specs for the Marlin. The phone should feature a 5.5-inch Samsung AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 (2K) resolution, Vulkan graphics support, OpenGL es 3.0 support, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor – though others suggest the phone will have the new Snapdragon 821 CPU on board, which might appear similar to the 820 in benchmarks. Furthermore, the phone is tipped to feature a SONY IMX179 front camera just like the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X and an IMX378 sensor that’s probably similar to the IMX377 found in the HTC 10. The phone is also supposed to feature an updated camera app and could support Boom Sound. Speaking of sensors, the phone will have an ambient light sensor, relative humidity sensor, and compass under the hood. New software features include new alarms, notifications, ringtones, UI sounds, and boot animation. Finally, Benis says that “N will ship with a proprietary SystemmUIGoogle.apk and SettingsGoogle.apk,” which might make the work of theme creators and ROM modders more difficult, xda-developers explains.

Since the media presents YouTube’s misleading talking points without challenge, it’s up to us to expose what’s really going on.  There’s a lot to sift through when one digs deep, so bear with me.  In the end, ask yourself if jumping on board, monetizing through YouTube’s Content ID, makes us all complicit in perpetuating the piracy racket that YouTube created to make billions for itself. 1.  YouTube’s 3 Billion Figure is all Smoke and Mirrors YouTube dangles Content ID and monetization in general in front of music creators to lure us to participate.  YouTube’s line is that if we jump on the monetization bandwagon, they’ll share ad revenue with us.  Sounds like a good deal, but YouTube’s ad revenue has proven paltry when compared to the real cost of producing music.  Like an Atlantic City casino, YouTube wants us to believe that we just might hit the jackpot.  Stories of viral videos make the news and seem like the new brass ring for rights-holders, but this insightful article explains how rare “viral” is.  And of the very, very few who achieve viral, who can sustain it and make a career of it? The real truth is that most music creators on YouTube are making nothing or next to nothing from the use of their work.  YouTube acknowledges that out of all people in the world with videos/music on its service, only 8000 “partners” qualify for Content ID.  The rest of us can put ads on the videos we ourselves post, but likely the majority of us are never paid anything, not reaching the $100 threshold YouTube requires of us to receive the first check.  And our own uploaded content is competing with pirated uploads of our music that we’re left to police.  The mountain of cash from all the music creators who haven’t yet reached $100 must be creating one hell of a “float” for YouTube. YouTube boasts of $3 billion in total payouts, but dig slightly below that surface, and you see a shameful number.  They’ve admitted it’s really less than $1 billion per year.  And think about it:  YouTube has over a billion users each month, and over 12 billion users a year, so do the math.   The measure of fairness is not how much YouTube has paid out in total, but it’s whether those who make the music that fuels YouTube’s fortune are getting paid adequately.  Here would be important questions to ask: 1. How many rights-holders are represented on YouTube?  (That number must be astronomical, and likely impossible to calculate.) 2. How many rights-holders can actually pay for the budget of a record from revenue they receive from YouTube? 3. How many music creators never reach the $100 threshold? 4. Of all the music-rights-holders represented on YouTube, how many make even minimum wage on an ongoing basis, year after year, for their life’s work that sits, year after year, on YouTube’s massive servers? Every musician knows that as long as music is available on YouTube for free, it won’t likely sell very well elsewhere, especially with all the available apps that can rip mp3s right from YouTube videos into your personal library.  And hey, what happened to the mechanical royalty for all of this, guys?  (I’ll be writing about that soon.)  So, if YouTube is going to corrupt all other income streams for those who invest their lives and means into the making of music, then YouTube should at very least pay a living wage, right? We’ve had plenty of time to test the ad model, and one thing is for certain:  Ad revenue does not pay for the making of music – not even remotely close.  The music industry should quit banging its head into that same wall looking for results.  Face the facts folks – ads will never fuel the music economy. 2.  YouTube Has Us Haggling Over Popcorn Prices, While They Walk Away With All the “Main Event” Revenue While we’re haggling over paltry ad revenue, we’re diverted from the far greater value that is being generated from our music.  Every month, our music drives billions of users to YouTube’s platform, and the data that Google then gathers from following our fans around the web is where YouTube’s true value lies.  Google and Facebook didn’t get their billion dollar valuations from ad revenue.  YouTube’s valuation largely comes from the mountains of hoarded data collected on the backs of all musicians and creators.  Therefore, part of the value of the YouTube empire should fairly belong to musicians.  Not only should musicians and creators share in the value of data gathered, but they should also have access to the data their creations generate.  Why in the world is it fair for YouTube to keep all of this data as a “trade secret” when it’s generated from our own fans, often through piracy YouTube expressly facilitates? 3. YouTube’s Dirty Secret about Content ID Content ID is available only to those whom YouTube chooses – and YouTube runs the place like an exclusive country club.  The simple fact is that the vast majority of independent musician-rights-holders are not accepted into Content ID.  I’ve received five GRAMMY® Awards, and even testified about the DMCA next to Google’s counsel, Katherine Oyama, listening to her boast at length about the virtues of Content ID and its ability to block uploads.  But when I came home from testifying in D.C. and applied for Content ID, I was denied.  Content ID is reserved for big record companies with big catalogues, and probably selected independent artists whom YouTube believes will make YouTube a heap of money.  And who even knows to what degree artists or companies with YouTube contracts are allowed to “block” uploads, as those contracts are under NDAs.  Are we seriously to believe they’d permit independent artists to join, only to block their entire catalogue from being uploaded? In the press, YouTube has fought back against the recent flood of criticism, saying that all rights-holders can access Content ID – that they can get it through “third-party vendors.”  These third party vendors often take between 20% to 50% of the revenue paid by YouTube—after YouTube takes its share.  That means the rights-holder is paying two overpaid gatekeepers.  So yes, it’s available, but at a completely unreasonable premium.  If big record companies are complaining about their bad revenue from YouTube, they should try being an independent musician, paying yet another middleman! But here’s the most relevant fact that YouTube keeps hiding: BLOCKING UPLOADS THROUGH CONTENT ID IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH THIRD PARTIES.  The use they bragged about before Congress – that they imply is available to everyone – does not exist.  The reason is obvious – without ad revenue, there’s zero incentive for the third-party vendor or YouTube to partake.  The third-party vendors would have to charge a fee big enough to pay YouTube and itself to simply block uploads.  What a sick game that would be – paying some third-party company and YouTube to block the pirated uploads YouTube promotes. Why can’t a rights-holder protect his/her work from illegal exposure on YouTube according to his/her Constitutional right, and then go sell it where he/she wants, for the price he/she chooses to set?  That’s reasonable, right?  Why is that such an unattainable dream for people like me and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of my colleagues? If an independent rights-holder wants to keep all their work off of YouTube and keep clear of YouTube’s ad-based, piracy-driven, self-serving, dirty, lawless racket, he or she is screwed.  Is there a single independent artist that YouTube has allowed access to Content ID for the sole purpose of “blocking” uploads?  Katherine Oyama should stop the bragging about Content ID until her company makes it available to “every” rights-holder for blocking.  And certainly, misleading Congress with false claims and self-aggrandizement in a Congressional hearing, and similarly misleading the American public through a calculated propaganda campaign, is in my opinion, deeply unethical. 4. Content ID Legitimizes Piracy – We Shouldn’t Be Complicit Music creators who succumb to the false appeal of “monetizing” on Content ID, or those whose record company has made that deal for them, have been swayed by YouTube’s line of baloney that illegal uploads are good and aren’t really illegal as long as YouTube offers a pittance from the ads they generate.  Clearly, the infringement orgy YouTube has sponsored for so many years has brought independent musicians and record companies to their knees, as they accept bad deals to monetize the crumbs that are left on the floor from a devoured industry. Our music industry’s acceptance of the “monetization” tool from Content ID only serves to “legitimize” the piracy that YouTube systematically breeds.  Monetization erases any last vestige of guilty-feeling-illegal-uploaders.  Content ID actually makes them feel good about themselves as they upload to their hearts’ content with zero inquiry.  “Look! I’m making the artists money AND giving them needed exposure, AND I’m offering the public free music at the same time!” I’ve heard this logic again and again from young people with bloated YouTube channels.  We’ve all fallen into YouTube’s trap:  By making a deal with the devil, right-holders are basically condoning the piracy that has destroyed the music marketplace.  Content ID monetization is steamrolling our Constitutional right to control our own creative works.  We shouldn’t buy into YouTube’s piracy scheme for the few scraps it might offer. 5.  Content ID Offers a Pathetic Deal With a straight face, YouTube tells you and the media that they give 55% of ad revenue to the rights-holder and only keep 45%.  But they calculate that percentage split after they first reimburse themselves for their own expenses, which they calculate behind their green curtain.  So the 55% figure is not of gross income.  An article by East Bay Ray explains that after YouTube pays itself about 37% for its expenses, rights-holders receive only about 35%.  That’s not a split, that’s a fleecing. YouTube’s approach reeks of hypocrisy.  Sure, YouTube has expenses.  But has anyone discussedour expenses in making the recording?  Costs should be figured on both sides.  We all agree that when a potter sells a bowl, the price reflects the cost of clay, glaze, the kiln, firing, etc.  When a clothing designer sells a pair of pants, the wholesale price covers the cost of fabric, thread, pattern design, etc.  But YouTube, or rather, Google, the richest company in the world, wants us to accept a business model where the “price” they pay for our music has no rational relationship to the actual costs of making the music.  Who cares about how much they say they pay out.  Their site contains almost the entire world’s library of music, and it’s not even coming close to paying the cost of making that music.  We invest all we have – time, talent, training, technology, and more.  We have the right to expect a reasonable return on that investment.  YouTube is an imperialist tycoon that is finger-flicking less than third world pay at musicians and the music industry for a product that YouTube shouldn’t even have access to in the first place. 6. Who is Clearing all the Rights for Music on Content ID Anyway? The answer is, probably no one.  When a record company puts out a record, the record company (assuming the artist hasn’t negotiated for ownership) likely owns the copyright to that recording.  And if the record company has struck a Content ID deal with YouTube, chances are they will monetize the record.  But what about the other copyright-holders?  Likely there are songwriters whose works are represented on the record, too.  Often there are several or more collaborators on any given song.  So, what about their right to block uploads?  Where are their royalties?  How are they accounted?  Are they accounted?  Who asked for permission?  Where is the transparency?  This is happening to me, and my answers are: none, nowhere, not, no, no one, and none.  YouTube is a jumbled, colossal rights violations mess that leaves independent rights-holders with the impossible task of doing DMCA takedowns, where YouTube publicly exposes our identities, leaving us open to repercussions from fans or record companies.  The intimidation leads us to do nothing but accept the loss.  There must be millions upon millions of such copyright violations on YouTube.  Maybe that’s why they don’t allow all of us to have access to the Content ID blocking mechanism, because they fear most records would have some rights-holder that won’t allow it to be monetized.  Well, if there was economic incentive, that wouldn’t be the case.  Isn’t that how a free market economy works? 7. YouTube’s Use of Content ID is Un-American Here are the bigger and broader questions for our industry and government.  Why aren’t musicians and creators allowed to be a part of the American free market, where we set our prices based on the cost of producing our own product?  That’s how manufacturing works in any freedom-loving country.  Why can’t a music creator set the valuation of his/her work in the same way one sells visual art?  Why are the Department of Justice and government, (all of whom are tarnished by their whirling revolving doors with Google – read it!) who are setting most of our prices for us, doing so based on failed ad revenue models from usurious companies?  Why are the DOJ and our government at large intent on propping up a bogus “freemium” model?  And why are they blind to the simple fact that big data companies operate freemium ad-based models all to the greater end of gathering invaluable data to become the biggest player in the AI (artificial intelligence) race? Why is the survival of theft-enabling, ineffective, ad-based internet businesses more valued than the future of music or livelihoods of musicians?  Why are we collectively not screaming our bloody heads off?  Our songs and music have shaped our culture and the world’s culture for centuries.  Music has brought people and cultures together, serving as the worlds’ ambassador without fail: a voice for freedom, for the oppressed, for change, for comfort, for celebration, and for transformation. Music creators should be treated like the valuable citizens of this country that we are.  We should be allowed to set our own price at very least!  We aren’t the indentured servants of YouTube, here to make the Google empire rich and powerful.  Given a fighting chance, the market would show how much our fans value our work, as it has for nearly a century.  Taylor Swift and Adele proved exactly that with their quite recent releases that sold millions of good-old fashioned CDs at regular prices.  But when we’re forced to try and create that market in a society with a complicit government that’s allowed copyright theft to run rampant, it’s an almost impossible situation. When YouTube serves the world mountains of pirated content on a silver platter without having to take a single step to stop the piracy, or Google is allowed to prioritize pirates in their ‘search’ algorithms (even after rights-holders send takedown notices), how could there ever be a true marketplace? 8. Without an Ability to Block Illegal Uploads with Content ID, We’re All Screwed For the vast majority of us that are unable to protect our music against piracy, we’re stuck playing Whack-A-Mole with an outdated and anemic DMCA takedown process, fighting a tsunami of piracy from a company that does all they can to keep the flood-waters flowing. So, let us ask ourselves as composers, songwriters, performers, producers, publishers, and record companies: are we willing to be complicit in this whole scheme, cementing piracy as an acceptable norm, all for the measly pocket lint they’re offering us?  I’d sooner fight piracy to the bitter end, and lose, than do that deal with the richest and scariest (“don’t be evil”) company on earth. 9.  YouTube Should Lose Their “Safe Harbor” for Withholding “Standard Technical Measures” The DMCA’s safe harbor provision requires that companies like YouTube must ensure that “standard technical measures” “are available to any person on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms” to identify and protect their copyrighted work.  (17 U.S.C. Sec. 512(i).)  YouTube is not allowed to discriminate as to who gets access to tools that have become “standard” in protecting copyright.  If YouTube does discriminate, it is supposed to lose its safe harbor. It’s right in the DMCA.  This is a point no one has yet pressed.  Content ID has been around and used billions of times to make billions of dollars for years now.  “Audible Magic” is available at a very reasonable price to any company wanting to offer blocking of illegal uploads.  And on Audible Magic, content owners can upload their content for free.  Apple has now created “iTunes Match,” and Facebook is rolling out its own similar fingerprinting technology, so it’s obvious that fingerprinting technology has become a “standard technical measure.”  YouTube can’t deny it’s become the core of their business.  And, if they also tout that it’s widely available through third parties, as they have in numerous publications, that suggests “standard,” too.  Digital fingerprinting is a standard technology that’s now very accessible, it’s just that YouTube stiff-arms most of us who want to use it to block pirated uploads.  And most other sites that allow music uploads from their users, pretend like Audible Magic doesn’t exist, because they don’t want it to exist.  And though the DMCA safe harbor provision requires YouTube (and all internet companies that also allow public uploads), to use the available fingerprinting technology, no one is yet enforcing this application of the law.  It’s high time. YouTube reserving its copyright protection feature for hand-picked rights-holders, blocking the masses’ ability to fully protect their Constitutional right, even though the technology is right there in YouTube’s dirty fingers, is like denying a rope to a drowning person.  Sounds like clear grounds to take away YouTube’s “safe harbor” protections to me.  It actually feels criminal by my own estimation, when you consider that the violated rights areConstitutional rights. I wish record companies would step away from their Content ID contracts entirely, and fight a noble fight to enforce this statute in the DMCA that would protect all rights-holders equally, rather than being a complicit partner in the pathetic and dirty Content ID piracy racket. 10.  Content ID Should Be Made “Open Source” for All Internet Platforms People are starting to wake up to the dangers of allowing a company to amass such power from data and artificial intelligence (AI).   There’s a movement to quickly develop AI technology and algorithms as ‘open source,’ in an effort to keep a few all-powerful hipster tycoons from having AI power over the entire world.  It’s called Open AI, and many seriously talented scientists are flocking to it.  Thank God there are a few people out there scared stiff by the power of those that are controlling AI. Since Google’s empire is built on the premise that “open” and “free content” is such a grand idea for us little folk, then it’s high-time it puts its money where its mouth is, and make Content ID fingerprinting technology for blocking illegal uploads available to us little folk as “open source” too.  YouTube likes to say how much it has spent developing Content ID, but that’s exactly the point: if you won’t share YOUR works with us for free because you want to recover YOUR investment, why should you expect us to give away our works for free, without having recovered OUR investment? And YouTube, don’t dictate how we rights-holders can use this now-standard technology.  Let rights-holders use it as they wish – to block or to monetize – no NDA’s, backroom deals, or intimidation.  Let’s make it all free and open, and see what a real marketplace looks like when we actually take measures to control infringement. YouTube/Google wants the public to believe that certain “copyright” protection somehow harms the internet.  But when their own trillions are made on their own “copyrighted” software, through their own “copyrighted” algorithms and databases, and through their own “trade secret intellectual property,” they suddenly guard it like Fort Knox.  Somehow, YouTube’s and Google’s own copyrights are “good,” but musicians’ copyrights are “bad.” Here’s the simple truth: protecting copyright doesn’t hurt the internet, it only hurts piracy.  And in the final analysis, Content ID is really just another sneaky way for YouTube to get rich off of piracy, and to try to appear like they’re throwing us a helping hand.  It’s underhanded and deceitful.  We as a music industry shouldn’t negotiate away the true value of our work out of desperation, giving way to the powerful grip of a racketeer (in my opinion) that just wants to keep us quiet. _________________________________________________________________ Are you a performer, songwriter, composer, producer, or fan, who wants to to help protect the future of music?  Sign on at musicanswers.org.

Future of Lung Cancer Tx: Oncotherapy Network & Cancer Network LATEST MEDICAL NEWS iMedicalApps Android Phones to Send Location Info in Emergencies So far, feature available only in England and Estonia MedpageToday savesaved by Satish Misra MD August 03, 2016 In a post on the Google Europe blog, Google announced that a new Emergency Location Service feature in Android would send location information automatically when someone calls emergency services. Emergency services weren't exactly designed with mobile phones in mind. We've talked recently about some exciting ways that mobile technology is being used to modernize emergency services, like crowd-sourcing responses to cardiac arrest calls to speed up CPR delivery. When someone calls from a landline, their location can be identified because it's already tied to a physical address. But when you call 911 from your mobile phone, even if it has GPS, emergency services often have no idea where you are. John Oliver did a great bit on this issue if you want to learn more about it. Google's new Emergency Location Service takes direct aim at that problem by sending your location directly to emergency services. According to the blog post, This feature is solely for the use of emergency service providers, and your precise location is never seen or handled by Google. It is sent from your handset to emergency services only when you explicitly place an emergency call, either directly or through your mobile network. Currently, the feature is only available in England and Estonia. As an aside, if you're surprised that Estonia is on that list, it's worth reading about some of the really ambitious ways they're using technology on a national scale. Implementation in the United States will likely be more challenging given the fragmentation of emergency response systems. But similar to the forays of Google and Apple into healthcare in general, these companies are uniquely poised to solve that problem and make this service more broadly available.

With knowledge of the basics, communicators can analyze and improve their rankings. But sometimes it can seem that no matter what you do, your content and websites plateau outside the top 3 results on Google. Like almost everything in the digital space, SEO is in a constant state of flux. Driven by Google’s mandate to give web searchers the best possible experience, algorithms are continually tweaked to deliver on that promise. The only way for communicators to stay relevant in such a space is to stay informed and always use the latest tactics. To decode SEO in general and comprehend where it’s going, you have to understand where it’s been. Allison Fabella, global director of SEO, CareerBuilder and speaker on PR News' upcoming SEO Strategies That Will Help Your Message Find the Right Audience webinar, looks at some of the most significant developments in SEO and what they mean for your sites. The Evolution of Mobile Over the past several years, Google has slowly been turning up the dial on mobile as a ranking factor going from a whisper to an in-your-face scream. At the core of all mobile factors is site speed and performance. In 2016 a sluggish site simply can’t survive in a competitive landscape. Here’s how I see the phasing in of mobile for SEO over time: Phase 1 (around 2011): Google implied a preference for responsive/mobile-friendliness Phase 2 (Spring 2015): “Mobilegeddon” forced mobile friendliness with diminished rankings for sites who didn’t pass the test Phase 3 (early 2016): Accelerated Mobile Pages “AMP”—Currently Google’s latest “it” feature. With its search results prominently displayed in a carousel above the regular results listing, this is a giant incentive to make site pages AMP friendly. Originally offered just to publishers, this feature is quickly rolling out to many other industries including e-commerce, travel, recipes, etc. Enhanced Search Results Displays The ubiquity of mobile paired with today’s immediate gratification culture (who scrolls below the fold anymore?) has made “special” result displays an even bigger prize for SEOs. While not all of these features are new, Quick Answers, Rich Cards, Star-rated reviews (plus other Rich Snippets), and of course, Local are all situated above the regular search results—sometimes in giant boxes—and create an irresistible click opportunity for searchers on the go. Rank Brain + User Signals Search engines have always somewhat paid attention to user behavior. However, search activity is more important than ever with the rollout of Google’s machine-learning artificial intelligence technology, RankBrain. Known as Google’s “Hal,” RankBrain is currently considered one of the most important ranking factors and incorporates thousands of sub-signals to get to the heart of users’ search intent. And what better (albeit creepy) way to figure out what users want (or don’t want) than to carefully monitor their behavior? Some user signals that Google looks for to indicate search result satisfaction: Click-through rate from search results Time spent on site Bounce rate Pogo sticking Social shares Follow Allison: @alli12 Follow Mark: @MarkRenfree Related Communicating Hillary’s Health: What’s Changed Since the 9/11 Ceremony What Pinterest’s Instapaper Acquisition Means for Communicators 5 Ways Right-Brained PR Pros Can Use Google Analytics 2 Ways Chobani Just Changed the Employee Relations Game What Snapchat’s Chat 2.0 Update Means for PR Pros Recent 6 Reasons for B2B Companies to be Thankful for PR 4 Ways to Build Lasting Relationships With Industry Influencers Trump: Social Media King-Elect CSR: The Biggest Corporate Protector of the 21st Century 3 Snapchat Best Practices for B2B Brands Upcoming November 29 — Make Your Dollars Matter With Your Paid Social Posts December 6 — PR News' Winter Awards Luncheon December 7 — Media Relations Conference and Snapchat Boot Camp December 9 — Social Media Awards December 16 — Use Facebook Live to Broadcast Your Brand Story and Grow Your Audience February 23 — Digital Summit & Crisis Management Boot Camp May 22 — The Social Shake-Up Trending Chili’s Crisis Proves How Little It Takes to Sink a PR Effort PR Insider: 6 Steps To Create a Comprehensive PR Plan 5 Ways to Create Engaging Social Media Graphics Getting the Job: 5 Tips for Acing the Dreaded PR Writing Test 3 Do’s and 3 Don’ts for Launching Your Influencer Relations Program Featured Jobs Sign up for the Job Seeker » View All Jobs » Public Relations Coordinator - City of Charlotte Housing Authority - NC Associate Director of Brand Public Relations - Aspen Dental Management, Inc. - NY Account Supervisor - Crenshaw Communications- NY Find a Job   | Post a Job Customer Center Subscribers Help & Info Shop Advertise Online & Newsletter Sponsorships Areas Advertise E-Letters Events Guidebooks Jobs PR News Blog Privacy Policy The Lists Twitter Directory Water Cooler Webinars Learn About Contact Us Sister Sites Cablefax Cynopsis Studio min Folio Event Marketer Industry Alerts Sign up for our e-Letters | © 2016, Access Intelligence, LLC.

Google's New Nexus Smartphones to Come with Exclusive Features GO The new phones will come with dual tab layout Aug 5, 2016 14:21 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google is working hard with HTC to release two new Nexus smartphones, with some specs having already leaked online. However, a new rumor indicates that Google could incorporate some exclusive features in these upcoming devices. A report from Android Police reveals that Google will introduce a new layout for its settings apps on the new Nexus phones. The new layout will come with the Google Support tool, a new feature for activating ambient display mode using double-tap, and a Night Light that would tint the screen red by turning off blue pixels. The information is not official, which means that it should be taken with a grain of salt as Google might not implement these goodies in the end. One of the exclusive features could be the Night Light Google's new Support app will allow Nexus users to share their screen live with representatives from customer support so that issues with the phone are solved faster and in an easier way. Images of the Night Light have been posted on the website, and the feature was previously called Night Mode in Android 7.0 previews. The Night Light would allow users to customize the blue light filter to activate during certain hours. It's unclear if the feature will be incorporated into Android 7.0 and available to other smartphones as well, or if it will be limited to the two upcoming Nexus phones. Owners of Nexus smartphones will be able to double-tap the screen in order to activate the ambient display feature, which would allow users to view notifications without having to wake the smartphone. Previous reports also showed that Nexus smartphones might come with a new launcher and a redesigned home button that would be linked to Google Assistant. It remains to be seen whether all of these changes will be implemented in Nexus Marlin and Sailfish, or they will be made available to other users through Android 7.0 Nougat.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (7 Images) #Google#Nexus Marlin#Nexus Sailfish#Android 7.0 Nougat#Night Light subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it New features to arrive with Nexus smartphones (7 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Nexus Smartphones Could Be Released at Verizon Nexus 6 Owners Having Issues with LTE Data Worldwide Home Button in Nougat 7.0 Shown in Animation, Could Be Tied to Google Assistant New Nexus Devices to Come with Swipe Fingerprint Gesture iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks 7 photos    Purported image of Nexus smartphones New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   New Phone Battery Promises to Charge in Seconds, Lasts for More Than a Week more on: smartphone battery i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

It was… interesting, to say the least. There were many mixed feelings regarding its design, with most hoping that it was simply a reactionary element instead of a persistent one. Today we have our answer. Android Police has obtained an animation of the home button in action, and thankfully it’s pretty apparent that the “flower” only blossoms when you make a specific action. That action, according to the rumor, is bringing up the Google Assistant that we heard about at Google I/O. The full animation shows the dots expanding in each respective direction, and then quickly aligning themselves horizontally. After all is said and done, they eventually retract into the white home button that we’re used to. Unfortunately, that’s all the detail we get. There’s no word on whether each color responds to a different action that can be launched after you hold and swipe in a different direction, or whether it’s a one-size-fits-all for launching Google Now or Google Assistant. Hell, the source isn’t even positive that this exact design will make it into whichever update we’re said to be getting these changes. Either way, we’re feeling a lot better about this thing than we did when we first heard of its existence. local_offer    Google  Google Assistant  Google Now on Tap   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (12) stars Further Reading Verizon offering Pixel for $10 a month DEAL: Google is dropping $30 off of Googel Home Google WiFi may be the best router Google updates the YouTube app with a new icon and more Google Shops are launching in Canada and the UK stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertPokémon GO makes big changes CP levels closePokémon GO is making big changes to the CP levels of your favorite Pokémon Pokemon GO is bring big changes to the balancing of the game by tweaking the CP levels of some of your favorite Pokemon (for better or worse). 2 more_vertHTC may exit the mobile smartphone market closeHTC may be looking to get out of the smartphone business A new rumor suggests that HTC may be planning to sell off its mobile division due to suffering too many losses. 3 more_vertDitto is now live in Pokémon GO, here's how to catch him closeDitto is officially live in Pokémon GO, here’s how to catch him Today, Niantic has officially released Ditto into the augmented wilds of Pokemon GO.

Technologies Sarah Schmid Stevenson August 5th, 2016 @XconomyDET_AA @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints After building Lucida, an open-source intelligent personal assistant, University of Michigan spinout Clinc has a new $225,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to help get its artificial intelligence technologies to market. That’s on top of closing a $1.2 million seed round disclosed in March. The equity funding round was led by Ann Arbor’s eLab Ventures, with participation from Hyde Park Venture Partners and Cahoots Holdings. Clinc co-founder and CEO Jason Mars said the company is on a mission to lead a transformative shift where state-of-the-art A.I. research emerges from the lab to be more seamlessly applied toward solving problems in the real world. Mars said he always wanted to start an artificial intelligence company, and his path to entrepreneurship opened last year after he and his Clinc co-founder, Lingjia Tang, created Sirius, an open-source virtual personal assistant. “We found the algorithms used by Google and Apple, so we stitched them together to create an end-to-end open-source platform,” Mars said. “It made a huge splash, and from the moment we released it, we heard from large companies all over the world asking how to commercialize the technology for their products. There was a clear void in the market if you weren’t Apple or Google, and we decided it was a world need we could deliver on.” After releasing Sirius in March of 2015, Clinc officially launched four months later. Despite the interest in Sirius pouring in from around the globe, there was one entity that took exception. “We got a letter from Apple,” Mars explained. “They said they loved the project but not the name, because it was a little too close to Siri. We fought back for a while, but we decided it would be easier to change the name. So, in November, Sirius became Lucida.” After the name change, the Clinc team continued to work around the clock to further develop Lucida, Mars said. “We want Lucida to be the open-source counterpart to Siri or [Microsoft’s] Cortana. The goal is to build artificial intelligence that solves problems in people’s lives.” According to Mars, what Lucida offers is a platform for cloud A.I. applications. The federal grant will help Clinc improve the intelligent capabilities of Lucida and build a scalable technology infrastructure to power the digital engines required to run deep learning programs. Lucida is also designed to allow developers and the open-source community to create and deploy custom intelligent assistants in ways that are beneficial to society, such as improving technological access for disabled people. Mars said Clinc’s technology has the ability to transcend software code’s traditional rule-based user commands and canned answers. Clinc instead focuses on natural language processing to mimic human intelligence and communication. Because the company’s platform automatically learns over time, it’s not dependent on continual coding to grow, he said. Mars said the 11-person Clinc team will make money building its customers personalized engines that “live in the Lucida platform” and selling them as a subscription software service. He was especially excited, he said, about “democratizing” the kinds of artificial intelligence technologies used by Microsoft, Google, Apple, and other tech giants. “Understanding our own data is one of the problems we’re trying to tackle,” he said, using a person’s accumulated financial data as an example. Most people don’t have the time or inclination to pore over months of bank and credit card statements looking for useful patterns and information, he said. “As new data is generated over a lifetime, we have a very poor understanding of that story. But we can build an intelligent assistant to understand requests and provide insights.” Mars declined to go into much detail, but he said Clinc plans to release a financial technology assistant in September that will create instant insights on spending. He said the industry’s reaction to Clinc’s technology so far has been “super exciting.” “A lot of people are trying to solve this problem using a top-down approach,” Mars added. “But what we’re doing is creating an experience with completely natural, unbounded speech.” Meanwhile, Mars is also hard at work on the faculty team behind a $4.5 million collaboration between IBM and U-M called Project Sapphire, which is creating a virtual academic advisor that will be built on top of Lucida. “It’s a really nice problem—we have a lot of unstructured data and a host of student data,” he said. “We’re building the A.I. to extract insights and create a natural language experience. IBM is crazy about this project because in A.I., data is gold. Getting access to build this kind of conversation is what drove them to invest in the project.” As far as Clinc goes, Mars is excited to see what happens when technologies he’s spent a good chunk of time perfecting in the lab are released to a wider audience. “It’s a team effort—an awesome family of researchers working together for years and coming together to build a company,” he said. “I’m having the time of my life.” Sarah Schmid Stevenson is the editor of Xconomy Detroit/Ann Arbor.

Google is testing a new menu bar for the app that will give users quick access to information like transit times, driving distance, and more.More There’s nothing worse than driving to a busy downtown megaplex and coming to the sudden, horrifying realization that there aren’t any parking spaces in sight. It can easily ruin a night if you’re pressed for time, and that’s why the ever-astute Google is prepping salvation: parking availability alerts in Google Maps. Parking alerts, references to which were first uncovered by Android Police within the beta version of the Google Maps app for Android, will do exactly what you’d expect of them: indicate how difficult finding a parking space is likely to be in a given locale. The app will describe congestion in levels of increasing severity, easy, medium, and hard, and provide descriptions for each. According to the app’s as-yet unfinished code, “easy” areas have “plenty of parking,”; medium” spots “may not be easy” to park around; and “hard” streets,”  have “limited” available space. Related: Google is crowdsourcing information to help make maps more accurate It’s not clear just how — or where, for that matter — Google is determining the availability of parking spaces. Apps like Parker tap into internet-connected meters in garages and on streets, while other systems leverage motion sensors, car-tracking cameras, GPS, Bluetooth connectivity, or a combination of several. And still other, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology research project PocketParker, discern parking availability by mapping smartphone accelerometer stats atop freely available mapping data. Android Police wasn’t able to nail down the source of parking data, nor any other factors — e.g., the time of day, proximate traffic conditions, or significant calendar events — that appear to factor into Map’s report. It’s possible, if disappointing to consider, that the feature might simply take into account the number of parking venues in a given area, or the number of spots open on average, rather than availability at a given moment. Related: Google wants you to help it build more accurate maps Luckily, Maps’ other upcoming features are far less a mystery. Android Police reports that a “keep map north up” setting locks the compass to northbound orientation rather than a free rotation, which is the default. Accidental swipe protection prevents the accidental brush or swipe across the screen from sending Maps into a tizzy — Maps will automatically compensate for a two-finger gesture that unintentionally rotates the map, for instance. And members of Google’s Local Guides, a program which recruits Maps users to submit information about local places, will receive notifications indicating whether their contributions are “approved,” “pending,” “not applied,” or “unknown.” Given the developmental nature of Android Police’s discoveries, there’s a likelihood that some won’t ever see the light of day, or will reemerge in another form. But here’s holding out hope that at leats one emerges from Google’s skunkworks unscathed.

As per the leaked gif image when you long press the home button, it turns into four small dots with the same colours that are associated with Google's Assistant with a swift animation (seen below), reports Android Police. To further clear any doubts, the site says that its source has confirmed that when the Google Now feature is turned off for the smartphone, the animation goes away. Currently the animation makes Google Now on Tap launch, but with Google Assistant still in development and only expected to be launched alongside the new Nexus phones, it remains possible the animation will give you options that tap into Google Assistant instead. (Also see: Sundar Pichai Says Google Will Be More Opinionated With Nexus Device)The reports of customisations for the Nexus series (in this case, via the launcher) is in line with Google CEO Sundar Pichai's statement that the company was planning on getting more opinionated with is Nexus offerings. There remains the possibility that these changes will make their way to Android 7.0 Nougat, or, that the launcher will work on non-Nexus smartphones. As with any other Nougat 7.0 leak, we can't say for sure whether this will make Google's final cut or not but if the company has indeed gone ahead with the development of this animation and wants to promote its Google Assistant feature further. In other leaks, the search giant is tipped to have changed the colour theme for its 'settings' menu to a UI that is dark grey, blue, and white in colour. The night mode has also been suggested to come under the name 'Night Light'. The settings tab is suggested to be divided into two sections 'All' and 'Support' in the latest leaks. This particular change has been suggested to be exclusive to the upcoming Nexus devices. Another feature "Quick Screen Check", that has surfaced, will allow the users to check their notifications without waking the phone up fully.

And just in time, the company just released a video ad just few days ago that tries to make the same point again. But iOS is hardly the only game in town, especially on mobile. And while Google hasn’t exactly made a similar claim for Android, others have spoken for it instead. But before go off on another crazy adventure, we first have to look at the few, of course unofficial, attempts at making Android the ultimate PC replacement, as far as OS is concerned at least. Yes, this is the so-called “Android PC”. Android is a better mobile OS for PCs Taking Android and making it run in a traditional computing environment is something that neither its original creators (Danger) nor Google have envisioned. Just as they didn’t originally envision Android to run on tablets. And yet, the nature of the Android platform, as well as the conventions that have grown around it, have made it almost the perfect platform to use in a PC, desktop, or laptop setting. Exposed file system While the debate between how Android and iOS handles and exposes file systems rages on, our second review of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro shows just how critical that capability is when doing real serious work. While stock Android, or at least the version of Android that Google ships in Nexus devices, doesn’t instantly reveal that file system to users, it doesn’t exactly block them from finding out, accessing files and folders, or installing apps that can, a.k.a. file managers. But more importantly, that is also true for apps that need to access files, like uploading them to websites and what not. That is actually a powerful feature that is only found on regular desktop operating systems. Some would argue, however, that it also exposes Android and its apps to security exploits. That might actually be true to some extent, but in most cases, Android’s permissions system can impede unauthorized access. Plus, it might also be worth the risk. Input support While there are creative Android apps that are best used with fingers, when it comes to other types of work, you’re most likely to reach for a keyboard to get things done. And when you’re already in that typing position, reaching out to the screen to manipulate things on the screen is not only tedious, it is also not ergonomic. Yes, there are times when the mouse is a better pointing device than your finger. Luckily, Android supports all kinds of mice out of the box. Wired, wireless (RF), or Bluetooth (at least most), Android can use them all and even shows a handy cursor when it detects such a pointing device is connected. And it goes beyond mere keyboard and mouse even. With the right drivers, Android devices can support more types of peripherals? Ever tried attaching a Wacom drawing tablet to a Remix Mini have it automagically work, pressure sensitivity and all? Or how about sitting back to relax and play a game with a controller, sometimes even if the game itself doesn’t natively support one? These are just some of the cool, and sometimes insane, things you can attach to or do with Android devices. And it all boils down to the most important reason. Open platform Android is, and for the foreseeable future, an open source platform. For various definitions of the words “open source”. This has allowed the OS to support features that Google may have not considered, or may not even approve of. It has allowed hackers and developers to take Android and put them on devices that, again, Google might not even want. Like, say, desktops and laptops. But Android’s biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. Its openness has given birth to diversity and fragmentation, two sides of the same coin. In this particular context, of using Android as a PC replacement, it may not have such dire consequences as on smartphones and tablets, but it does mean that there is no unified, consistent experience or an assurance that things will work consistently across devices or ROMs. But since Google is unlikely to standardize on an Android PC spin, like it is doing with Android TV and Android Auto, we’ll have to accept matters as they are. At least for now. Your PC on a stick, phone, or slab So now that we’ve established that Android can be great for a personal computing experience, our next question is, of course, whether there are indeed attempts at doing so. As you might have already heard by now, there are, in fact, a lot! There are different solutions available, ranging from what you already have in your pocket or bag, to more exotic pieces of equipment. Android Android, as it already is, can be shoehorned into a PC experience. And by that, I mean practically blowing up your screen to bigger display, attaching a keyboard and mouse, and done. It is, of course, not the prettiest option, but it is the most economical. The only specialized piece of equipment you need is a cable to output video from the smartphone or tablet, the latter in case you want an even bigger screen. But since not all smartphones support HDMI or MHL or SlimPort, sometimes the most generic solution is a Chromecast or Miracast receiver. That said, at the moment, iOS trumps Android, even Android tablets, in one important aspect: split screen. iOS 9 already implemented that much wanted multi-tasking capability, but Android has yet to embrace it. The good news is that Android Nougat will hopefully address that limitation. How much, we still don’t know. There are, of course, exceptions to this. Manufacturers, with their custom Android skins, are able to implement different types of multi-tasking, from split, even quad, windows to floating windows. Samsung started that trend with its Galaxy Note smartphones and tablets and some OEMs, particularly those with phablets, have followed suit. Those, however, are still rare and few in between to make it a consistent experience. Remix OS When it comes to using Android as a PC, there is perhaps no name more popular these days than Jide’s Remix OS. After all, how better to use Android as a PC than by having movable, resizable windows and a taskbar. True to its name, Remix OS remixes the entire Android system in order to deliver what is billed to be a truly productive experience. There are, of course, pros and cons to this. As a near complete revamp of Android rather than something slapped on top, Remix OS presents the exact same user interface and features on any device that has Remix OS installed. And as a full Android system, it isn’t limited to Jide’s own suite of apps designed for windowed use. The disadvantage is that Android, as it stands right now, wasn’t made for this kind of use and apps aren’t exactly designed with resizing and moving windows in mind. From time to time, this rears its ugly head in apps that don’t exactly behave properly outside of their comfy phone or tablet screens. Remix OS is also something that isn’t exactly as widespread as vanilla Android. While the OS is liberally available for Intel and AMD powered PCs and laptops, it is ironically rarer on mobile devices, even tablets. And, given its specific design, it isn’t at all available for smartphones. Maru OS To be blunt, Maru OS is a “cheat”. While promising a desktop experience using only your smartphone, it actually doesn’t do so for Android. Maru OS does run Android primarily and mostly, but the PC experience that comes when you connect the smartphone to an external display is actually Linux. On the one hand, this does mean that you have the power of full Linux desktop software when you do so. On the other hand, unless you’re a Linux user already, you might find yourself in an alien, sometimes unforgiving, land. The biggest drawback of Maru OS is that it is officially available, in beta even, for one and only one device: the Nexus 5. A favorite among hackers and tinkerers, the Nexus 5 has long shown its age. Even worse is that the desktop mode is activated only by making a wired connection between the Nexus 5 and a monitor. No Miracast or Chromecast option. The fact that the Nexus 5 uses a not so popular SlimPort connector complicates matters further. Superbook and Andromium Andromium, the team behind both the initial failed Kickstarter and the now super successful Superbook Kickstarter, perhaps presents the best and yet the most ambitious form of Android PC experience. Taking inspiration from the likes of Microsoft’s Continuum and Ubuntu’s Convergence, Andromium promises that you only ever need your smartphone to get work done. Part of that promise will be fulfilled by the Superbook, basically an empty laptop that only contains a display, keyboard, touchpad, battery and ports. Majority of the magic, however, will be done by the Andromium software. Andromium, the app, kicks in when you connect any smartphone to the Superbook through the magic of a wired DisplayLink connection. Andromium itself is really just a facade that presents a familiar desktop interface to users. It does have specially designed apps that can be resized and moved. But for the most part, it really is just a layer on top of Android. The good news is that you still have access to all your Android apps unconditionally. The bad news is that integration between all sorts of apps isn’t exactly harmonious and the illusion breaks so easily. Andromium, however, is still in beta, though everyone is free to try it on any Android smartphone at this point. Superbook, on the other hand, is already way past its funding goal but there is no assurance that it will be delivered on time, if at all. Wrap-up Android has always had the irony of choice attached to its open source nature, giving users so many choices to the point of paralyzing them. That is even true in this admittedly still niche aspect of using Android devices as a PC. But with a paradigm shift starting to unroll, especially in tablets and through Apple’s own pushing, there is a chance that Android, at least on tablets, could take on a different form, one that has a bias towards productivity and work. Either that or Google pushes Chrome running Android apps as its productivity champion.

Apple Is Launching a Bug Bounty Program Apple is launching a bug bounty program designed to discover vulnerabilities in its products and services. This is the first time Apple has expressly offered cash rewards to developers for finding bugs. Until now, the company has merely maintained a tip-line for people to disclose bugs they happen to uncover. Why is it that Apple can drop billions on marginally useful companies, but can’t throw a few million at a bug bounty to secure iOS / OS X? — Jonathan Zdziarski (@JZdziarski) June 30, 2016 The bug bounty program will launch in September, and offer rewards for those finding working exploits in recent hardware and the latest version of iOS. Unfortunately, this isn’t open to everyone, with Apple initially inviting a select band of trusted security researchers. However, the program may be opened up over time. Apple is one of the last big tech companies to launch a bug bounty program. Google pays out millions of dollars each year as a result of its bug bounty program Google Will Pay You $100+ If You Just Help Them Out Google Will Pay You $100+ If You Just Help Them Out Google has paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to regular users for doing one simple thing.

The app, called Verne: The Himalayas, takes the form of a simple free-roaming sandbox game, with the player controlling a yeti as he wanders the area discovering various things peppering the landscape. Everything you find has an educational element to it, but it’s all presented in a fun style to help maintain kids’ interests. You can zoom in for a Street View-style perspective, fly up into the sky for a bird’s-eye view, or just seek out all of the speakers recounting facts about the region. Verne: The Himalayas is available on Android right now. Oliver Stone Warns: “Turn Off Your Phone” Acclaimed movie director Oliver Stone is keen for you to “Turn Off Your Phone”. In a PSA which will play before showings of his new movie Snowden, Stone reminds us just how powerful those devices we all carry around in our pockets are. For good and for bad.

By Andrew Brust for Big on Data | August 5, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics In October of last year, I wrote about 14 different big data acquisitions that had taken place. In that article, I grouped the deals and picked out some trends. In some cases, the acquiring companies were building out their clouds. In another case, a traditional data warehouse vendor added big data technology to its stack. In another instance, private equity stepped in; open source companies went commercial in a couple more. To round things out, a financial risk management company and a media company each acquired analytics technology companies of their own. Also read: 14 Big Data acquisitions and why they happened Since I wrote that article, several other deals have been announced. Microsoft scooped up Metanautix in December, SAP bought Roambi in February, and Tableau acquired HyPer in March. Just last month, Teradata announced it bought UK firm Big Data Partnership, and Workday announced it would acquire Platfora. Also read: Microsoft acquires big-data analytics vendor Metanautix Also read: Tableau buys HyPer, to add R&D center in Munich Also read: Workday plans for Platfora revealed Before going further, and in the interest of full disclosure, I should point out that in addition to my work with ZDNet, I am Senior Director of Market Strategy and Intelligence at Datameer, an erstwhile competitor of Platfora's. With that in mind, I'm going to talk about the Workday-Platfora deal only at a high-level. Let's look at the following five deals. At first blush, they will each seem pretty different from one another, but there's a broad theme that ties them together. M&M Microsoft's acquisition of Metanautix would seem to be around the latter company's "Quest" product, and its ability to provide a uniform SQL interface to a great many data stores. Like Google's Dremel technology, as well as Apache Drill, Quest provided a SQL-on-Anything gateway that could have obvious utility within the entire Cortana Intelligence Suite. Quest could query documents and files, in addition to databases. So, with a little imagination, one could even see it being used to power "bot" interfaces to Microsoft Office. Buying the company also let Microsoft re-hire someone who was among Google's data cognoscenti: Metanautix CEO Theo Vassilakis. The original Dremel paper was co-authored by Vassilakis while he was at Google, prior to starting Metanautix. Vassilakis is now Azure Data Partner Development Manager at Microsoft; he also worked for Microsoft Research before his tenure at Google. Tableau gets HyPer Microsoft isn't the only company to acquire an engine and hire some talent in the process. Tableau's acquisition of HyPer gives it access to key in-memory hybrid OLAP/OLTP database technology that it may wish to use to make its product faster. That said, it also may have been an aqui-hire, in an effort to build out an engineering presence in Europe (HyPer was a German company). SAP roams by SAP's acquisition of Roambi has some interesting inner loops to it. The company was founded as MeLLmo by a team that included co-founders of Xcelsius, a data visualization company and product that Business Objects acquired in 2006. SAP announced its acquisition of Business Objects in 2007 and closed the deal in 2008, bringing Xcelsius under the SAP umbrella. Under SAP ownership, Xcelsius seems to have been put out to pasture, having morphed into something called SAP Crystal Dashboard Design. But the Roambi acquisition would appear to be SAP's second chance at the Xcelsius/MeLLmo team's data viz technology. Roambi was focused exclusively on delivering data visualization on mobile devices. The output was beautiful, but the niche opportunity less so. SAP didn't disclose terms of the deal, but there were rumors that it was an asset buy and that the sale price was quite low. Meanwhile, if you think about SAP's flagship ERP business, having a great mobile visualization story -- and grabbing it for a bargain price -- makes a lot of sense. The ERP-analytics plot thickens That theme of adding visual analytics to Enterprise software would seem to carry over to the Workday-Platfora deal as well. Analytics can be most powerful when its embedded -- so for a major software company to want to own and embed significant analytics IP seems quite logical. Zendesk's acquisition of BI software vendor BIME Analytics, which I covered in my October article, would seem to fit into this grouping as well. Teradata wants service Teradata's acquisition of London-based Big Data Partnership seems a bit less straightforward. Of course, Teradata has already done a number of deals; I covered three of them in my October article. An earlier Teradata acquisition, in late 2014, was of big data consultancy Think Big Analytics, and the Big Data Partnership deal fits in with that very nicely. In fact, Big Data Partnership has been formally folded into Think Big. Why would Teradata execute a services play not just once, but twice? Ultimately, it would seem to come down to Enterprise sales. Implementing big data -- and doing it successfully -- is still hard, and experienced consulting shops/Systems Integrators (SIs) can make enterprise customers feel a lot more confident moving forward with it. That puts them in the perfect position to recommend tools and technologies. So, having a manageably small, but geographically distributed, services organization can be very helpful to Teradata indeed. Enterprise starship Looking back on the various deals we've discussed here, it seems the common thread for all but one of them is the enterprise. Whether the enterprise cloud, in the case of Microsoft Azure, enterprise software, in the case of SAP and Workday, or enterprise consulting and sales, in the case of Teradata, four of the five deals we've looked at seem to have enterprise stamped all over them. Software companies that want growth have to become companies that serve the Enterprise. So why doesn't the Tableau-HyPer deal really fit the pattern? I'm not sure, but I do think a lack of enterprise focus at least partially explains why Tableau has missed its earnings targets for three consecutive quarters now. Also read: Tableau posts mixed Q2 results but continues to attract new customers Maybe Tableau's next play should target the enterprise too. Correction: this post originally stated that Tableau had missed its revenue targets for three consecutive quarters. It was updated to state that it missed its earnings targets over that period.

Search Case Study; Boomtrain–5 Things You Can Do to Make Your Customer Experience Stickier Written on Aug 5, 2016  Author Adotas  | Tweet Courtney O’Donnell, the Senior Shopping & Feed Manager at Elite SEM was one of only 10 ad execs nationwide to get The 2016 Google Search Excellence Award. The awards are given annually to the top 10 individuals at Google’s partner ​advertising agencies to highlight their excellent work and thought leadership in search marketing. The award is based on nominations from Google sales and judged​ by a panel of Google sales​ management execs. Courtney (pictured left) led the Jet.com Shopping Team at Elite since the account launched in July 2015. According to Google: “She has worked diligently to drive coverage of millions of SKUs on Google Shopping and has taken the client from $0 quarterly spend to $15MM in their first quarter and has now nearly doubled that to $28MM/quarter in Shopping alone. Courtney has helped the client move from an acquisition model to a margin-based bidding and account structure strategy in only 5 quarters. Through her consistent partnership with the Google Account team, Commercialization, and PMs, Courtney’s program is driving Jet’s overall business growth as a company. Courtney consistently makes decisions with her client’s growth and success in mind and is a strategic partner to the Google team. She is an expert in her field and a joy to work with. Courtney navigates tough problems with ease and class, and we’re so thankful to be working with her!” ______________________________________________________________________ Yahoo! Search Case Study: Wayfair Search is often the first place consumers turn when considering a purchase. A top online retailer for home furnishings in the U.S., Wayfair wanted to make its search ads work harder to attract and convert customers online, and ultimately achieve its KPIs. “We wanted to increase our click-through rates over time, and make sure that our search ads were truly bringing high-quality, high-value traffic to the site,” said Dan Wulin, Associate Director, Data Science at Wayfair (pictured left). In their latest case study with Wayfair, Yahoo! uncovered how engaging searchers and optimizing search ads can lead to some amazing success. “People who use Yahoo Search tend to be more heavily engaged and generate more conversions on our site than the average visitor. We also saw the large investment in and growth of Yahoo Gemini as a platform, so we knew we would see more traffic and customers through search advertising on Yahoo,” said Wulin. Read the case study to learn: How Wayfair used search advertising to achieve a CTR 240% higher than the retail industry benchmark. How search advertising through Yahoo Gemini can deliver improved conversion rates and boost online sales. “Wayfair has continuously enhanced its search advertising and optimization through Yahoo Gemini as part of its customer acquisition strategy and it’s delivering results,” said Courtney McKlveen, Vice President & Industry Lead, Retail at Yahoo. “In addition to Yahoo Gemini search ads driving traffic to the Wayfair site, what’s really powerful is that consumers who engage with them tend to generate more conversions and have a higher order value than the average visitor to the Wayfair site. So with back to school and college season ahead, when search is the top online source for consumers, we look forward to continued successes with brands like Wayfair.” ______________________________________________________________________ New Book from Boomtrain: 5 Things You Can Do to Make Your Customer Experience Stickier A few things you’ll learn from this eBook: How to tailor your digital experience to each customer.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Nexus Launcher can work with Nova Launcher (well, sort of) By Ida Torres - August 5, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter So you’ve probably heard the rumors that Google will be coming up with a new Nexus Launcher for their upcoming Nexus phones to be unveiled later this year. You’ve probably seen the leaks and maybe even downloaded the APK. But what if you don’t have a Nexus phone to try it out on? And what if you still want to keep your Nova Launcher? Well, you can actually recreate the features and experience in your Nova launcher, thanks to one of the resident XDA Developers people. The Nexus Launcher looks different from other launchers because it doesn’t have an app drawer anymore. Okay, it still does but it’s hidden behind your home screen and to bring it up, you need to swipe up or touch the arrow near your static icons, and it will appear. The static icons have also now been increased to five instead of the usual four. And instead of a Google search bar at the top of your screen, you now have a G tab on the left (to launch Google Now) and a Google Calendar widget on the right. To be able to recreate this on your Nova Launcher, you will need to install two Zooper widgets which you can download from the source like below, install the Zooper Widget Pro (which costs $2.99), a Polycon icon pack, and of course the Nova launcher. The process is a bit long but the instructions (seen in the source link again) are pretty easy to follow. If you like playing around with stuff like this, then you should probably try it out, since there are a lot of tweaks that you can do. Of course we don’t really know if it’s the upcoming Nexus Launcher, but it looks good enough to try out.

There’s also something called the Olympic Games happening in Rio de Janeiro – but the real humdinger is the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games. A 41-week pregnant woman says she triggered labour by playing Pokémon Go To mark the Olympics, Google has launched the series of mini-games where you compete in Olympic events as a piece of fruit. No, we don’t know why either. Google released the game with a trailer, which is the current doodle on the site’s home page, that shows cute characters running, cycling, swimming, and playing golf, tennis and water polo. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Pineapples have a vicious serve (Picture: YouTube/Googledoodles) The trailer seems to promise sprinting strawberries and swimming lemons, and it’s all very colourful and silly.

But even here the company is seemingly losing steam, says a report by Strategy Analytics. The market research firm in its latest report says that in Q2, 2016, Apple sold only 8 lakh iPhones and the sale of its iOS devices was down by 35 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. On the other hand, Android continues to surge in India, especially now when the Windows Phone is no longer a challenge and when more affordable Android phones are available. The operating system made by Google now utterly dominates the Indian with 97 per cent market share. It is almost like a monopoly, although Google's Android is very different and allows phone makers to modify the software so it is not technically accurate to describe it is a product completely owned by one company. Also Read: Apple iPhone sales may decline by 18 per cent in 2016 "Android shipped 29.8 million smartphones in India in Q2 2016, growing an impressive 28 per cent annually from 23.2 million units in Q2 2015. Android maintained first position across India with a record 97 per cent OS share for the quarter, up from 90 percent a year ago," said Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics. At the same time, Apple was facing fresh challenges. "Apple iOS fell 35 per cent annually and shipped 0.8 million (8 lakh) smartphones in India in Q2 2016. Apple's smartphone market share has halved from 4 per cent to just 2 percent in India during the past year. Apple iOS will need to reduce iPhone pricing to cheaper levels, attract more operator subsidies and enlarge its retail presence through Apple stores or online channels if it wants to re-grow significantly in the future," said Woody Oh, Director at Strategy Analytics. Interestingly Apple sees India as one of its top growth markets. Just a few weeks ago Apple CEO Tim Cook had highlighted that even as its growth slows down in the major markets of the world, the iPhone sales were growing in India. "India is now one of our fastest growing markets," Tim Cook said after Apple declared its results for the latest quarter. "In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51 per cent year on year." Apple is almost more resources in building a more robust retail channels and is hiring more people in the country. A few months ago Cook visited India for the first time, signalling the company's intent to improve its sales here. At the same time, however, the company has faced challenges because of the high price of the iPhone in India. The country is among the most expensive places to buy an iPhone and historically Apple has kept a tight rein on the phone retailers in a bid to ensure that pricing remains closer to the MRP and discounts are not as widespread as those available on pho0nes from other companies. Apple has probably done it to ensure that its brand image, which is one of the top attractions of the company's products, remains untarnished.

Following a theme that Microsoft has been pursuing for some time, some notifications that pop up in Windows 10 for those using Chrome claim that the Google browser is “draining” their battery and that a switch to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer replacement, Edge, could save up to 36% of their battery life. (John Stillwell/PA) However this tactic is nothing new, with Google having used a similar approach itself in the past to try to convince users to move from Internet Explorer to Chrome. It appeared to work, with Chrome overtaking IE to become the most popular desktop browser. Microsoft has since said that the notifications are designed to be “tips” for users that “help them enhance their Windows 10 experience”, the tech giant told The Verge. It also confirmed that the tips can be disabled from within the notification settings of the software, should you not wish to be reminded about your battery life.

The app will its show parking status at destinations selected by users. The feature was first spotted by Android Police website in Google Maps v9.34 Beta teardown. As per the report, it is not yet clear as to how Google plans to gather the parking availability data. Also, it is not clear if the information available will be real-time or not. Currently there is no indication if the particular feature will take into account factors like time of the day or specific events. However, more information on it will surface as Google sends out an update. Google Maps update brings multi-stop support to iOS Google may have fixed one of the biggest problems with its Maps app on iOS. The search giant has rolled out an update to its Google Maps app on Apple’s iOS platform. Besides giving parking information, the Maps app might come with "Keep map north up" which is a replacement of "Tilt map". The feature is expected to launch navigation mode with the map's compass pointed North. Disabling the app would lead to free map rotation with navigation. The upcoming version will also include a re-centre button for cases when a user accidentally swipes the map while finding his/her way through the app and ends up looking at a view that neither has the destination nor the route. The accidental swipe protection is said to trigger only during fast swipes. The feature goes back to either the user's location or the position for an upcoming turn. The Google Maps v9.34 Beta can be manually downloaded and installed via an apk file available with APK Mirror website. Google Maps recently rolled out an update to include multiple-stop support. The feature first came to the web version, followed by Android and later iOS.

And now, Google is sending messages and notifications to Google Search Console users to create AMP pages. The messages read "Create AMP pages to be shown in Google Search for domain. The messages aren't too far off from the ones we've seen in January targeting news publishers. But these seem to be targeting a wider range of webmasters, not just those who write news. It says "AMP pages to be shown in Google Search," not just the top carousel. Alan Bleiweiss shared a screen shot of a message he received yesterday on Twitter, here is that screen shot: I guess expect more and more push from Google to make your pages AMP ready. Forum discussion at Twitter. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google Rio Olympics Logo: The Doodle Fruit Games   Comments: Anon User 08/05/2016 12:18 pm My guess on this is that 99.99999% of webmaster globally will not care about this. David S Freid 08/06/2016 05:39 pm Hello Anon, just wanted to add my point of view, "that they should care". We have been following AMP since the very first day and have also written and developed in-house many AMP pages our clients. I also see "Google AMP" as an important element of SEO today and even more so tomorrow. Thank you, Barry Schwartz for sharing about this timely Google announcement. Riccardo Bianchini 08/07/2016 10:57 pm Hi David, I would like you to elaborate a bit more why you deem AMP an "important element of SEO today". AFAIK they do not provide any ranking advantage, John Mueller stated that a hundred times. I have activated over 2,000 AMP in one of my websites for 6 months without seeing any, even marginal, ranking or organic traffic advantage. I suspect they caused a small ranking drop instead since, in order to get my AMP validated, I was forced to deactivate both Google's pagespeed module on my server and the WPML mobile-friendly language switcher, which lowered a bit my mobile score in GSC. To add insult to injury, I haven't got A SINGLE click on my AMP in 6 months. So far, IMHO, from a publisher's point of view, AMP performances are even worse that FB instant articles (which I disabled two weeks ago, since their conversion rate was simply horrendous). Stephen_Dow 08/09/2016 05:34 pm We have no interest in moving ahead with AMP pages at this time. Google can push all it wants. There's just too much complexity in changing the many relatively new sites/businesses we've been working with. I think the wisest thing would be for a non world-leader in Internet speed (the U.S.) to get with the rest of the world. Stop punishing companies and web developers #Google!

Find out which cloud VPS provider meets your hosting requirements. By James Sanders | August 5, 2016, 4:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/eternalcreative While cloud services providers like Amazon and Google have garnered a great deal of favor in enterprise markets, their byzantine billing systems makes using these services far from straightforward for small to medium businesses, developers working on their own projects, and users with more general computing resource needs. However, the growing cloud virtual private server (VPS) market has a host of options that may fit their needs better. These cloud service providers offer the ability to quickly bring up servers (optionally, with preconfigured apps) while providing a better value for the money than Amazon and Google. 1. DigitalOcean Although DigitalOcean was founded in 2011, they are a favorite of developers due to their extremely straightforward billing system and simple API. According to Netcraft, they are second only to Amazon EC2 in terms of web-facing computers. DigitalOcean has data centers in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Frankfurt, Toronto, and Bangalore. Users have the option of Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, CoreOS, and FreeBSD, as well as dozens of deployable application images on top of Ubuntu 14.04, including content management software such as Drupal, Joomla, and MediaWiki, and NoSQL database packages Mongo, Cassandra, and Redis. Video: CXOs sound off on the critical challenges facing IoT, big data, and the cloud (ZDNet) Of the nine available pricing tiers, DigitalOcean's entry-level offering provides 512 MB RAM and one processor core, combined with 20 GB SSD storage and 1 TB transfer for $5 per month. The company's most popular plan, though, provides 2 GB RAM, two processor cores, 40 GB SSD storage and 3 TB transfer for $20 per month. For all plans, automated weekly backups add 20% to the cost of the server instance. DigitalOcean also provides block storage for $0.10 per GB, per month. 2. Scaleway Scaleway (a division of Online.net) is in a slightly different category. They offer microserver deployments in addition to standard VPS options, all from their facilities in Paris. Users have the option of Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora (as with DigitalOcean), as well as OpenSUSE, Alpine Linux, Gentoo, or Arch. The available deployable images skew toward European software trends—while WordPress is available, Serendipity is as well. Other options that have gained more traction in Europe include Prestashop, Cozy, and Syncthing. Additionally, OpenVPN and Minecraft server image deployments are also available. Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy Scaleway's debut offering, the C1 ARM microserver, offers a quad-core ARMv7 CPU, 2 GB RAM, 50 GB of SSD storage, and a 200 Mbit/s unmetered internet connection for €2.99 per month ($3.33 USD). For those who prefer, or have dependencies on, x86-64, the VC1S VPS option provides the same specifications with 2 x86-64 CPU cores for €2.99 per month, with additional processor cores and RAM available in VC1M and VC1L packages. In a price comparison with DigitalOcean's aforementioned "most popular" plan at $20/month, the dedicated "C2M" option provides 8 dedicated x86-64 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM, and 50 GB SSD, with 500 Mbit/sec unmetered internet connectivity for €17.99 ($20.00) per month. This is far more raw resources than what DigitalOcean provides—a DigitalOcean instance with eight CPU cores and 16 GB RAM is $160 per month. However, the connection bandwidth metering (rather than transfer metering) may be a significant downside for some. Of particular interest and importance is Scaleway's block storage pricing. Storage is available in 50 GB units for €1 per month, each. Oddly, volumes are limited to a maximum size of 150 GB, though with a maximum of 15 volumes per server, a total of 2250 GB. Once again, this is a bargain compared to DigitalOcean. 3. Linode Having launched in 2003, Linode is the senior player in this market. The company has four US datacenters, as well as facilities in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, and Singapore. Linode supports much of the same Linux distributions previously mentioned, as well as Slackware (for some reason). Users willing to jump through a few hoops can install any custom distribution of their choice. Linode does not offer one-click application deployment, though their StackScripts repository is available to ease application deployment. SEE: Ethics policy: Vendor relationships (Tech Pro Research) While Linode does not have a VPS tier below $10, their available tiers are particularly competitive. As part of a celebration of their 13th year, the amount of RAM included in each tier was increased. The entry level tier offers a single x86-64 processor core, 2 GB RAM, 24 GB SSD, and 2 TB transfer, for $10 per month, and double all of those values (except transfer, which increases to 3 TB) for $20 per month. Backups add 25% to the cost of the server. For applications (particularly, databases) which have high memory requirements, Linode is a compelling option. 4. Vultr Relative to the three aforementioned VPS providers, Vultr's focus is on flexibility. The company offers the ability to use Windows Server, in addition to Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, CoreOS, and FreeBSD. It is also possible to upload an ISO of your favored distribution rather than use the available images. Vultur also has more data centers—instances can be deployed in Seattle, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Atlanta, New Jersey, Chicago, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo, and Sydney. While Linode's pricing structure offers more RAM compared to DigitalOcean, Vultr offers more SSD space on average. Vultur's $20 plan includes 5GB more storage than DigitalOcean, though the other specs are the same. Like DigitalOcean, block storage is available for $0.10 per GB, per month. What's your view? Do you use one of these providers? Do you prefer to stick with commercial scale providers like Amazon and Google for VPS hosting? Share your deployment strategies and experiences in the comments.

What is full text searching? Why Another Full Text Indexer? Features Limitations Performance Tests Using the Sample Application Code Behind the Sample Application Using hOOt in your Code How It Works Some Statistics... Index Engine Query Engine What's an inverted index? The power of bitmap indexes Files generated File Formats : *.WORDS File Formats : *.DOCS File Formats : *.BITMAP File Formats : *.DELETED File Formats : *.REC File Formats : *.IDX Appendix v2.0 Appendix v3.3.7 Revisions History Introduction hOOt is a extremely small size and fast embedded full text search engine for .net built from scratch using an inverted WAH bitmap index. Most people are familiar with an Apache project by the name of Lucene.net which is a port of the original java version. Many people have complained in the past why the .net version of lucene is not maintained, and many unsupported ports of the original exists. To circumvent this I have created this project which does the same job, is smaller, simpler and faster. hOOt is part of my upcoming RaptorDB document store database, and was so successful that I decided to release it as a separate entity in the meantime. hOOt uses the following articles : WAH compressed BitArray found here (WAHBitArray.aspx) mini Log4net replacement found here (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/miscctrl/minilog4net.aspx) MurMur2 hash index and storage file from RaptorDB found here (RaptorDB.aspx) fastJSON serializer found here (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/fastJSON.aspx)  IFilter without COM by Eyal Post found here (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/IFilter.aspx) for the sample application Based on the response and reaction of users to this project, I will upgrade and enhance hOOt to full feature compatibility with lucene.net, so show your love. Why the name 'hOOt'? The name came from the famous Google search footer and while looking for owl logos (gooooogle ~ hOOOOOOOt ). What is full text searching? Full text searching is the process of searching for words in a block of text. There are 2 aspects to full text indexers / searchers : Existence : means finding words that exist in the many blocks of texts stored (e.g. 'bob' is in the PDF documents stored). Relevance : meaning the text blocks returned are delivered by a ranking system which sorts the most relevant first. The first part is easy, the second part is difficult and there is much contention as to the ranking formula to use. hOOt only implements the first part in this version, as most of use and need the existence more in our applications than relevence, especially for database applications.   Why Another Full Text Indexer? I was always fascinated by how Google searches in general and lucene indexing technique and its internal algorithms, but it was just too difficult to follow and anyone who has worked with lucene.net will attest that it is a complicated and convoluted piece of code. While some people are trying to create a more .net optimized version, the fact of the matter is that it is not easy to do with that code base. What amazes me is that nobody has rewritten it from scratch. hOOt is much simpler, smaller and faster than lucene.net. One of the reasons for creating hOOt was for implementing full text search on string columns in RaptorDB - the document store version. Hopefully more people will be able to use and extend hOOt instead of lucene.net as it is much easier to understand and change. Features hOOt has been built with the following features in mind: Blazing fast operating speed (see performance test section) Incredibly small code size. Uses WAH compressed BitArrays to store information. Multi-threaded implementation meaning you can query while indexing. Tiny size only 38kb DLL (lucene.net is ~300kb). Highly optimized storage, typically ~60%  smaller than lucene.net (the more in the index the greater the difference).  Query strings are parsed on spaces with the AND operator (e.g. all words must exist). Wildcard characters are supported (*,?) in queries. OR operations are done by default (like lucene). AND operations require a (+) prefix (like lucene). NOT operations require a (-) prefix (like lucene). Limitations The following limitations are in this release: File paths in document mode is limited to 255 bytes or equivalent in UTF8. Exact strings are not currently supported (e.g. "alice in wonderland"). Wildcards (*,?) are not currently supported. OR not currently supported in queries (e.g. bob OR alice). NOT not currently supported in queries (e.g. bob NOT alice). Parenthesis not currently supported in queries. Ranking and relevance is not currently supported. Searching user defined document fields are not currently supported. Performance Tests Tests were performed on my notebook computer with the following specifications: AMD K625 1.5Ghz, 4Gb Ram DDRII, Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit, Win Index 3.9. hOOt generates a lot of log information which you can use to see what is going on inside the engine. Using the sample application I performed a crawl over a collection of around 4600 files of about 5.8Gb of data in various formats here are the results using grep on the output files (bear in mind that the application was compiled under .net 4 and running 64bit, 64bit IFilters were installed also) : Document Count 4,490 Total time ~22 min Index file size 29 Mb Text size total     632,827,458 characters Total hOOt Indexing time 56767.2471 ms  ~  56.7 secs Total hOOt writing document info time (fastJSON serialize) 110632.3282 ms ~ 110 secs Total words in hOOt ~290,000   As you can see the indexing engine is blazing fast going through 632mb of text in 57secs, the difference in time to the total 22 minutes is to do with the IFilter extraction time. On the query side for the above document count all queries perform in about 1 ms on the engine side and as you can see in the sample picture a search for "microsoft" gives back 208 items which took 0.151 seconds, again the difference is to do with the document deserialization time. By comparison lucene.net has the following : Index file size 70.5 Mb Total time ~28 min Performance Tests v1.2 Using a better word extractor the index size is reduced by about 19% to 24Mb.   Using the Sample Application The picture above is the obligatory desktop search application built on hOOt . To use the application do the following : Set the index storage directory in the (1) group box, this will store all the index information. Choose a folder where you want to crawl for content in the (2) group box. In the (3) group box you can do the following : Load hOOt : This will load hOOt so you can query an existing index. Start Indexing : This will load hOOt and start indexing the directory you specified. Stop Indexing : This will come active after you have started indexing so you can stop the process. Count Words : This will show the number of words in hOOts dictionary Save Index : This will save anything in memory to disk. Free memory : This will call the internal free memory method on hOOt (this will only free the bitmap storage and not release the cache). You can search for content in the (4) group box, the label will show the count and time taken. To open the file just double click on the file path in the list box. This is just a demo that show cases hOOt , although it works as is, it does need some bells and whistles for a real application. To use this sample effectively please install the following IFilter handlers beforehand : Foxit PDF filter found here (http://www.foxitsoftware.com/) [never use Adobe as it is dismally slow].  Microsoft Office 2010 IFilter found here (http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=17062) Changes in v1.5  As of version 1.5 queries follow the lucene style of requiring prefixes and support for wildcards have been added as follows: prefix (+) character for AND operations : +microsoft +testing 

Search for "microsoft" and "testing" and all words must exist
 prefix (-) for NOT operations :   microsoft -testing

Search for "microsoft" excluding "testing"
 default is the OR operation :  microsft testing

Search for "microsoft" or "testing" and any word can exist 
 for wild cards use (*,?) like old style DOS searches and all the results will be ORed together:  m?cro*
 
Search for "macro" or "micro" or "microsoft" or "microphone" or ... 
 Code Behind the Sample Application The code behind the sample application is pretty easy to understand, it uses the BackgroundWorker class to to the indexing with progress events for the UI to show the files done. private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
	string[] files = e.Argument as string[];
	BackgroundWorker wrk = sender as BackgroundWorker;
	int i = 0;
	foreach (string fn in files)
	{
		if (wrk.CancellationPending)
		{
			e.Cancel = true;
			break;
		}
		backgroundWorker1.ReportProgress(1, fn);
		try
		{
			TextReader tf = new EPocalipse.IFilter.FilterReader(fn);
			string s = "";
			if (tf != null)
				s = tf.ReadToEnd();

			h.Index(new Document(fn, s), true);
		}
		catch { }
		i++;
		if (i > 300)
		{
			i = 0;
			h.Save();
		}
	}
	h.Save();
        h.OptimizeIndex();
}
 Using hOOt in your Code Using hOOt is simple and straight forward. // specify the index folder to store information and the file name for the index files
Hoot hoot = new Hoot("d:\\IndexFolder" , "documents"); 

hoot.FreeMemory(false); // will free bitmap memory

// database mode of operation
hoot.Index(10, "some string from a database"); // index the contents of rec# 10 

// document indexing mode of operation
hoot.Index(new Document("d:\\filename.ext",string_from_file));  

// optimize the bitmap index size
hoot.OptimizeIndex(); 
 You can inherit from the Document object and store any extra information your application needs as properties (lucene uses dictionary values which isn't nice at compile time and requires debugging at run time if you misspelled etc.). public class myDoc : Hoot.Document
{
	public string Extension {get;set;}
	// any other properties you need
} Because hOOt uses fastJSON to store the document you created, it gives you back what ever you saved, as a first class object. New in v1.2 foreach(string filename in hoot.FindDocumentNames("microsoft"))
{
   // a faster way to get just the filename instead of a Document object
}
 How It Works hOOt operates in the following 2 modes :   Database mode : where you want to index columns in a database and you supply the row number yourself from the database. Document mode : where you give hOOt a document file which will be serialized and stored and document numbers generated for it. hOOt has 2 main parts which are the following : Indexer Engine : is responsible for updating and handling the index generated. Query Engine : is responsible for parsing the query text and generating an execution plan. To optimize memory usage the indexer can free up memory in the following 2 stages : Compress bitmap indexes in memory and free the BitArray storage. Unload cached word bitmap indexes completely. For the most part you would use stage one, but if you are going to index 100's millions of documents the second stage is going to be necessary. Some Statistics... A quick search in the internet reveals the following statistics about the English language: There are about 250,000 English words of which around 175,000 are in use (Oxford English Dictionary).  The maximum length of a word in English is 28 characters. After going through the words extracted from the IFilters it is easy to see that there a problems with some document formating as some sentences don't have spaces and the words are stuck together. Also for programming documents CamelCase words are prevelent.  For this reason as of version 1.2 the word extractor in hOOt will do the following:  CamelCase words are broken up. Word lengths greater than 60 characters are ignored Word lengths less than 2 are ignored Index Engine The index engine is responsible for the following : Load words into memory. Load bitmap index data on demand. Extract word statistics from the input text. Update the word bitmap index. Free memory and bitmap cache. Write the words to disk. Write the bitmap index to disk. Query Engine The query engine will do the following : Parse the input string of what to search for into words Extract the bitmap index for all those words used in the search string Execute the bitmap arithmetic logic AND the result with the NOT of the deleted documents bitmap, to filter out deleted documents. Enumerate the resulting bitmap in the case of database mode give you a list of record numbers in the case of document mode seek the document number and give you a list of documents from the documents storage. What's an inverted index? An inverted index is a special index which stores the words to bitmap conversion data. In a normal index you would store what words are in a certain document, an inverted index is the opposite given a word 'x' what documents have this word is stored. For example if you have the following : Document number 1 : "to be or not to be, that is the question ..." Document number 2 : "Romeo! Romeo! where art thou Romeo! ..." Would generate the following when parsed by the GenerateWordFreq method: words : {"to" count=2, doc#=1 }, {"be" count=2, doc#=1}, {"or" count=1, doc#=1} .... words : {"romeo" count=3, doc#=2}, {"where" count=1, doc#=2} ... And the following word bitmaps would be updated (1 being the existence of that word in the index position of the document number, 0 being not found): to : 1000000... be : 1000000... or : 1000000... romeo : 0100000... where : 0100000... The power of bitmap indexes To see the power of bitmap indexes take a look at the following diagram : As you can see for the query string "alice in wonderland" (without the quotes) hOOt will do the following : The filter parser extracts the words "alice", "in", "wonderland". Seek the associated bitmap indexes for the words. Execute the query arithmetic logic in this case a logical AND operation to yield a resulting bitmap index. The resulting bitmap is the index based record numbers to the document, for example if the result is 0001100... then the documents 4,5... (starting from index number 1) contain all the words "alice", "in" , "wonderland". This is in marked contrast to lucene indexing scheme which saves the record numbers literally albeit in an optimized notation. hOOt offers huge space savings in index size especially with the WAH compression used, and as an added bonus, performance is extremely fast.   Files generated The following files are generated in the Index directory: filename.WORDS : stores the words extracted from the input text. filename.DOCS : stores the document information. filename.BITMAP : stores the bitmap information for the words stored. filename.DELETED : stores the deleted document indexes. filename.REC : stores the data file offsets for document numbers. filename.IDX : stores the mapping between document file names and document numbers log.txt : stores the logging debug and error messages. File Formats : *.WORDS Words are stored in the following format on disk : The bitmap index offset will point to a record in the *.bitmap file. File Formats : *.DOCS Documents are stored in JSON format in the following structure on disk: This format came straight from RaptorDB and is being used there, the only modification in hOOt is that the MaxKeyLength is set to 1. Also because the records are variable in length the *.RECS file maps the record number to an offset in this file for data retrieval. File Formats : *.BITMAP Bitmap indexes are stored in the following format on disk : The bitmap row is variable in length and will be reused if the new data fits in the record size on disk, if not another record will be created. For this reason a periodic index compaction might be needed to remove unuesd records left from previous updates. File Formats : *.DELETED Deleted index file is just a series of int values that represent deleted files with no special formatting. File Formats : *.REC Rec file is a series of long values written to disk with no special formatting. These values map the record number to an offset in the DOCS storage file. File Formats : *.IDX IDX file is MurMur2 Hash dictionary for mapping document file names to document numbers. This is used in document mode.  Appendix v2.0 Finally I got round to updaing hOOt, most of the updates are post backs from RaptorDB which are for stability, bug fixes and performance improvements, things like locks and multithreading issues. The bitmap file format has changed to support index offsets and the storage file has been updated to support deleted items, so the previous files will not work in this release. hOOt now supports incremental indexing of documents and will check if the files exists in the index before indexing. You can RemoveDocument(filename) now and the file will be removed from the index results. File information like dates and size is now stored in the storage file, so in the future it will be possible to check changed files and index updated documents. Appendix v3.3.7 Finally found some time to give hOOt some love and post back a lot of changes made in the meantime in RaptorDB. Most of which are bug fixes. Notable added changes are the ability to inhierit your own class from Document and add properties, so you can now do : /// <summary>
/// Sample doc override
/// </summary>
public class myDoc : Document
{
    public myDoc(FileInfo fileinfo, string text) : base(fileinfo, text)
    {
        now = DateTime.Now;
    }

    // other data I want to save
    public DateTime now;
}
 Also the word extracting portion has now been extracted into it's own class so going forward you can more easily change the tokenizer.

Member 1210465622-Aug-16 8:50 Member 12104656 22-Aug-16 8:50  What a weird way to phrase that question... Anyway, I've been using this library with a few modifications of my own, and noticed that your use of MemoryStreams and FileSterams are not wrapped in using statements. I understand the current structure of the library requires you do that, but was there a reason for this? I noticed you have a FreeMemory() function but you would have less memory problems if you wrapped anything accessing the file system in a using statement, making FreeMemory() not needed for the most part. I'm wondering if I'm missing something here, but I feel like re-writing the library with the use of Using statements instead of indefinitely keeping streams open would give you a huge performance benefit. I'm in the process of seeing if it can be re-worked, but was curious about your intention with the keeping Memory and File streams open. Other than that, it's a great library. The indexing is super fast and both easy to use and modify outside of a few exceptions. Re: Why are you not using Using? Mehdi Gholam22-Aug-16 9:01 Mehdi Gholam 22-Aug-16 9:01  using is used for small blocks that dispose when done, which is not the case for hOOt. The memory pressure from hOOt is not from streams but the bitmap indexes/caches which FreeMemory() frees. Clarify AND and OR Behavior Member 164865618-Aug-16 1:04 Member 1648656 18-Aug-16 1:04  When I prefix e.g. two search words with a '+' my assumption is that both words have to exist in target files, but the result seems more like a logical OR. Let's say my search string contains the following: +development +estimates The reported matches contain one or both of the matches, so it looks more like an OR. I am missing something? Regards, Martin Bjornebye Re: Clarify AND and OR Behavior Mehdi Gholam18-Aug-16 1:10 Mehdi Gholam 18-Aug-16 1:10  Adding + means include/add or OR to the results. Adding - means not or remove from results. "development +estimates" -> development or estimates in the doc "development estimates" -> development and estimates in the same doc "development -estimates" -> development and not estimates in the same doc Relevance searches ... (simpler to work with than RegEx) Member 1212604017-Aug-16 22:39 Member 12126040 17-Aug-16 22:39  Hi there. It's a neat project and I think the small footprint will make it popular in many areas. However; if you decide to implement relevance in the search engine you may find some good inspiration in the old Dataware product BRS/Search. (Unfortunately the company wasn't great business people, so Dataware didn't make it...) I'm mentioning the product because the free text search capabilities of BRS/Search were very flexible, yet simple to use. The search syntax look like SQL with some extensions. BRS/Search had operators like "NEAR", "ADJ" and others, which make searching for words in a context very simple. The implementation also used binary arrays to give very fast searches, so maybe it'll be compatible with the work you already made. BRS/Search has since become "OpenText Livelink Document Management", but I'm not certain of how much of the original functionality remains. I know that several BRS/Search installations exist at different universities, where they kept it alive; probably because it was hard to find a decent successor ... Anyway - check it out. You may find some gold there ... Greetings /Dan Re: Relevance searches ... (simpler to work with than RegEx) Mehdi Gholam18-Aug-16 0:01 Mehdi Gholam 18-Aug-16 0:01  Thanks Dan!

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google appears to be blocking Windows 10 Mobile users from adding Google accounts to Outlook 1 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Aug 5, 2016 at 12:10 GMT4 months ago Google hasn’t really been the best of supporters of Microsoft’s Windows phone platform. Despite having a Google app for the platform, the firm has since refused to provide any more  apps for the Windows phone platform, and has engaged in actively blocking users from accessing its services. Once more, we’ve noticed that as of recent, Windows 10 Mobile users have become unable to add Google accounts to the built-in email and calendar apps. While we did think it was a bug that would be fixed quickly, nearly a month as passed since the issue first cropped up with no respite in sight. Users who attempt to login to Google via the Mail apps would simply be met with an error message, saying that their browser is not being supported and advising them to switch to a modern browser like Internet Explorer(!). Oddly enough, this issue does not show up when using the desktop version of Mail and Calendar which uses the same process, albeit with desktop Edge. While one could argue that most Windows 10 Mobile users are die-hard Microsoft fans and would rather use Outlook.com anyway, the fact remains that regular people do buy Windows phones and Google’s snubbing of their smartphone of choice will end up making their lives harder. In this case, the blocking of native email access for no clear reason. If you’re affected by this, you can pick up the free EasyMail for Gmail app from the Windows store to use your Gmail from Windows phones, or switch from Gmail to Outlook using these instructions from Microsoft.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Wall Street had field days July 27 and 28 with most of its tech titans exceeding expectations–results that were enough to send most of these companies’ stocks to record highs.  The two stars of the show were Facebook and Google, which had better than expected results. For the second quarter of 2016, Facebook reported revenue of $6.4 billion and net income of $2.05 billion. Google reported revenue of $21.5 billion and net income of $4.88 billion. Facebook is still having a stellar growth while its Silicon Valley rivals are underperforming. Admittedly, the companies are still miles apart in terms of size. Facebook will make around $27 billion in revenue this year and Google about $84 billion, according to analyst estimates. So Google is roughly three times the size of Facebook in terms of revenue. Graphic by Ram Srinivasan (Epoch Times) But Facebook is still showing a stellar growth. On a year-on-year basis, Facebook grew its revenue by a whopping 59 percent and its income by 186 percent. Google grew 21 percent and 24 percent, respectively. Where Is Facebook’s Growth Coming From? So where is Facebook’s massive growth coming from? The company says it has 1.71 billion global users. That is a 15 percent growth year-on-year, although the growth rate is actually decelerating. So it’s not coming from the sheer number of users. Facebook also hit 1 billion daily mobile users and 1 billion messenger product users, but those are not driving the growth either. What is helping Facebook is the growth of its advertising business. Year-on-year, its ad revenue grew by 63 percent. And mobile ads now account for a massive 84 percent of those ad dollars. So Facebook’s users on mobile are contributing the most to the company’s bottom line. The company’s average worldwide revenue per user is now at $3.82, which is up 15 percent from last quarter. The company earns $14.34 annually per user in North America. Ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth. — Dave Wehner, CFO, Facebook However, Facebook’s CFO Dave Wehner admitted during the earnings call that the ad growth will slow down going forward:  “Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016. Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017,” he said. “Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly.” So the ad load is the key. The way Facebook has been able to grow its ad revenue—which comprises the vast majority of its revenue—is through showing its user base more ads. And while ad load on Facebook itself might not increase, there’s always the possibility to see more ads on Facebook’s other products. Facebook recently introduced ways to purchase and display image and video ads on Instagram, and there are rumors that its heavily used Messenger product might start to show ads, as well. Executives at the social networking giant are quiet about whether its popular text messaging app WhatsApp—that it bought for $22 billion in October 2014—will also eventually get ads, but you can guess that Facebook will try to realize revenue growth whatever it can use to continue to please Wall Street. Google’s big growth story, though, doesn’t seem to be advertisement anymore. Google’s Growth Story As for Google? It is growing as well, albeit more slowly than Facebook. Its ad growth was more or less the same story as every quarter: less cost per ad, but more ads shown, and hence more revenue. One big growth story this quarter was the high mobile ad growth, and that might be something to watch over the upcoming quarters. Google’s big growth story, however, doesn’t seem to be ad-driven anymore. Its ad revenue, which still comprises the majority of Google’s revenue, grew a modest 19.5 percent year-on-year. Its real growth came from its “other revenues” item line, which grew 33 percent annually to $2.17 billion, or just over 10 percent of total revenue. That “other revenues” item line counts most of its significant non-ads business, such as its cloud platform, Google Play app, entertainment store revenue, and hardware sales. Non-ad business is expected to grow further as Google gets more and more into enterprise services with its cloud and app platforms.

Advertisement Description Technical Change Log Comments How To Browse Privately In Google Chrome Google’s game changing browser Chrome combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google’s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available. Speed Perhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. Clean, simple UI Google Chrome’s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn’t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008. Privacy Another hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome’s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences. Security Chrome’s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective. Customization A vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com.

The author’s views are entirely his or her own (excluding an unlikely case of hypnosis) and may not reflect the views of Moz. As marketers, we all want to achieve better ranking in the SERPs. Even with Google's recent design changes with ad placements, a lot of businesses and bloggers still rely a lot on organic search, and it isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Besides creating amazing content, building backlinks, and creating social signals; speeding up your website is a great way to help Google index and rank your site faster. Implementing a content delivery network (CDN) can be an easy way to see faster speeds and actually help improve your SEO. Editor's note: The author is employed by a CDN provider, KeyCDN. What is a content delivery network? First off, some of you might not be familiar with what a CDN actually is. Basically, it's a collection of edge servers (also known as POPs) positioned strategically around the globe. Their purpose is to store and cache a copy of your website's assets (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images). When a visitor hits your site, the assets are then served from POPs located in closest to them. For example, say you host your website with Linode in Dallas. When someone from Europe visits the site, they will have to request and download your entire website from Dallas. This results in latency due to the distance the data has to travel. With a CDN, a request is made to Dallas for the initial HTML doc, and then the JS, CSS, images, etc., are served from the closest POP. In this case, that means London. A CDN can dramatically decrease latency and minimize packet loss, which in turn speeds up the delivery of your content. How does a CDN help your SEO? There are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to using a CDN and how it actually affects your SEO. We'll address those in this post. But first, let's look at a few ways a CDN actually does help your SEO. 1. Speed is a ranking factor Accelerating websites is extremely important. Faster websites mean satisfied customers. PageSpeed becomes significant for rankings . — Matt Cutts, Google's former head of web spam Your site's webpage load times are very important, affecting everything from bounce rate to time on your website (dwell time), conversion rates, and the overall user experience. Google announced in 2010 that site speed is a ranking factor. Nobody knows just how much weight this ranking factor has, but you can pretty much bet that since it dramatically affects the user's experience that this weight will most likely keep increasing as time goes on. Especially now with the mobile devices sometimes accounting for over 50% of a website's traffic. Alert! Render-blocking scripts While a CDN can drastically increase the speed of your website, it is also important to remember a CDN is not a magic wand. It delivers your assets in the exact same way they are setup on your page. This means if you have a lot of render-blocking resources, you might still encounter delays. Render-blocking resources refer to assets such as JavaScript and CSS that are blocking the DOM and/or keeping the webpage from rendering until they are download and processed by the browser. A CDN will not fix this for you. This must be resolved on your origin server. Here are a couple of recommendations on how to fix render-blocking JavaScript: If your JavaScript is small, you can inline it Load your scripts asynchronously by using the HTML async attribute Defer your JavaScript Move JavaScript to the footer (not always the best solution) Alternate methods to defer JavaScript Here are a couple recommendations on how to fix render-blocking CSS: Properly call your CSS files Use media queries to mark some CSS resources as not render-blocking Lessen the amount of CSS files (concatenate your CSS files into one file, noting that this becomes less important with HTTP/2) Minify your CSS (remove extra spaces, characters, comments, etc.) Use less CSS overall 2. HTTPS is a ranking factor You can serve your assets over HTTPS with a CDN while not running your main website over HTTPS. You cannot do this in the opposite direction, however, as you'll run into mixed-content warnings. A web server and a CDN each require their own SSL certificate, which are completely separate processes. With the release of HTTP/2 (which technically requires HTTPS due to browser support) there have been a lot of performance benefits to using HTTPS. These include multiplexing, HPACK compression, one connection per origin, and server push. What this means is that HTTPS is no longer as slow as it once was if you are comparing it to SPDY. The team at HttpWatch saw speed increases of 20% when comparing HTTPS with SPDY/3.1 and HTTP/2. So how does this tie in with a CDN? Well, a lot of CDN providers now have "Let’s Encrypt" integrations. Let's Encrypt allows you to enable HTTPS on your CDN for free. And as long as your CDN provider supports HTTP/2, this means you can now easily serve all your assets much faster via HTTP/2. This will help in turn speed up the delivery of all your assets and directly affect how fast your pages load. You can of course always upload a custom certificate as well to enable HTTPS on your CDN provider. And remember, if you haven't migrated to HTTPS yet, you can do it in a two-step process. Sometimes it is easier to move your CDN provider to HTTPS first, and the migrate your web server to HTTPS afterwards. 3. Faster image indexing in SERPs To put it simply, a CDN can help you index your images faster in the SERPs. Google image search is a topic we rarely see discussed in the world of SEO and CDNs, and yet it is a very important feature of the SERPs that has been known to generate a lot of traffic. According to a case study by Brafton Marketing, 63% of Google image search clicks turn into site traffic. Obviously, similar success will vary from niche to niche. By hosting your images on a CDN, you can ensure they will index as fast as possible and Google will crawl them more often. This means you should see a direct correlation with the positions that your images rank for in Google image search. Another tip is to use a CNAME for your CDN URL. Typically, a CDN offers customers two options for their CDN URL: 1) a shared CDN URL name, which is automatically generated; or 2) a custom URL. Setting up a custom URL with a CNAME allows you to point your assets to a subdomain on your own domain such as cdn.yourwebsite.com. Here are a few reasons to consider using a custom CDN URL: If you use a custom CDN URL, you can use a sitemap to view indexed images data in Google Search Console. If you use the default zone URL, you will not be able to view this data. You could still use the URL search operator, however. You have full control over your custom CDN URL it and can switch CDN providers more easily while retaining the same URLs A custom CDN URL can make for better branding, as people might see your image URLs. Also, for Google, it sometimes might be better to associate the domain on the same as your root site. Alert! Yoast image indexing issue If you are using WordPress and your CDN images start to get de-indexed from your Google Search Console account, this is likely a sitemap structure issue with Yoast. You may need to add the following snippet at the top of your functions.php file in order to index your images from the CDN domain. Use this snippet, making sure to updating your CDN URLs accordingly. function wpseo_cdn_filter( $uri ) { return str_replace( 'https://www.yoursite.com', 'https://cdn.yoursite.com', $uri ); } add_filter( 'wpseo_xml_sitemap_img_src', 'wpseo_cdn_filter' );
 Debunking CDN myths As mentioned earlier, there are a lot of myths and misconceptions floating around the internet when it comes to CDNs. Let's take a look at a few common ones that suggest using a CDN is bad. 1. A CDN causes duplicate content issues False! Don't get me wrong, a CDN can definitely cause duplicate content issues if you set it up incorrectly. Here are a couple things to consider: Canonical header: You want to ensure you have a canonical header setup. This is an extra HTTP header that is added to your CDN to tell the Google crawler the content on your CDN is only a copy. Once you add this HTTP header, your images will index normally as the crawler will know that they are only a copy and not duplicate content. Most CDN providers have an option to enable this feature with a single click. Robots.txt file: Search engines scan the root of your website and look for a robots.txt file. If they find the file, they will follow the instructions; but if no file is present, they scan everything. By default, most CDN providers won't enable this, meaning everything is indexed. The canonical header usually does the work. However, if it is enabled you will will want to ensure it is allowing everything to be crawled. Here is an example of a robots.txt file on a CDN that simply allows everything. User-agent: *
Disallow:
Alert! Retain similar file structure It is also important to note that you should keep a similar file structure when migrating to a CDN. Otherwise, this can cause complications with your images and Google indexing. For example, here is perhaps how your path looked before a CDN. www.yoursite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/image1.png
 This is how it should look afterwards. cdn.yoursite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/image1.png
 This will ensure that Google, along with a proper canonical header in place, will index your images correctly and you will retain all the traffic in Google image search. 2. A CDN is expensive False! Some CDN's are available for $0.04/GB. Some providers use a pay-as-you go system, while others have a monthly payment. No matter which one you choose, CDNs are a lot more affordable than they used to be. To give you an example of how affordable they are, I have a site with a little over 60,000 visitors per month and I am paying $3.45 a month for a CDN. This will vary based upon your bandwidth, but if a majority of your site is simply normal traffic, you might end up paying less than you would for a cup of coffee at Starbucks. 3. A CDN is hard to set up False! A CDN can be complicated to wrap your head around, especially if you are just now learning what one is. However, there is a lot of information available out there to help you implement a CDN. Some CDN providers even have their own WordPress plugins, and integrations for almost every other platform out there, too such as Magento, Joomla, Drupal, Laravel, and Ruby. When in doubt, ask. You are paying for the CDN service, so never feel bad about asking your provider for help. Summary Hopefully, you now have a better understanding of how a CDN works and how it relates to SEO and SERPs. If set up correctly, a CDN can be an easy and cost effective way to speed up your website and get your content and images indexed faster.

Yes, most websites see drastic speed increases, especially those serving content to users around the globe. Another common mistake I see is that people will run a speed test before and after a CDN, but they do it from a test site close to their origin server. For example, if your CDN has a POP in Dallas, and you use Pingdom's Dallas location to test, this is not going to show much improvement. Better to test with a location further away from your origin server. 2 0 Reply <p>That's Antonio!

Normally 90% of the time you are good with async on most JS assets. There are occasions where I have seen that scripts are not executed in the order in which they occur in the page, which could cause issues. Or with TypeKite for example, when you load async, it causes a FOUT issue (flash of unstyled text). Best to test the async attribute with each request and ensure your page renders correctly. 3 0 Reply <p>Thanks! </p>

The async way to load JS is a typical best practice, though some Google scripts and other providers do not serve async scripts. We had some scripts from different companies that we had to include for our clients, but these scripts could not be included with the async property. I guess there is no workaround for external scripts which do not respect async?! 2 0 Reply <p>Hey Brian,</p>

Google Maps' new update is set to include a feature which tells users where available parking is.  WHAT MIGHT THE UPDATE INCLUDE?  'Keep map north up' function - keeps the orientation of the map, even when the device is rotated Areas categorised by available parking - areas will be itemised as easy, medium or hard Accidental swipe protection in 'North up' mode - as long as the map compass is in north-is-up mode, fast gestures that cause rotation of the map will automatically adjust back to the normal orientation. The beta version of Google Maps v9.34 has just been pre-released on Android, and is expected to have several new features.  The app will now tell users which areas are likely to have parking spaces available before they reach their destination.  According to Android Police: 'The categories are broken up into three obvious groups: easy, medium, and hard.'  There is no indication where the data comes from, or whether variables such as time of day or events in the area will be factored.  Instead, this may simply be a measure of how much parking there is in an area - not how many spaces are available.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Google's self-driving car has another crash: A minor bump... Is Serena less forgiving than Murray? Men may have evolved... Share this article Share Another update expected is to the system's navigation settings screen, which is one of the only immediately visible changes.  A new toggle has been added called 'Keep map north up', which forces the Navigation mode to launch with the compass locked in North position.  The previous version (left) had a 'tilt map' feature, however this has been replaced in the new version (right) by a 'Keep map north up' feature Swipe protection has also been added which will automatically adjust fast gestures back to normal orientation.  This could help people who are using the map when driving, to ensure the map cannot flip and disorientate them. In June, the app had a subtle makeover to have a 'cleaner look'. Google removed unhelpful details from the desktop, Android and iOS versions of its mapping app to make landmarks and traffic stand out.  While the beta version of v9.34 has been released on Android, it is unclear when the official update release will be, and how many of these new features will really be included in Google Maps. GOOGLE MAPS GETS A PIXEL UPGRADE WITH NEW IMAGES In June, Google gave its maps a high definition refresh thanks to new satellite imagery data. The Californian web giant first released its cloud-free map of the world in 2013, made up of a patchwork of high resolution photos taken by the Landsat 7 satellite. But combining fresh images from a more modern satellite with new processing techniques has meant the view of Earth has been refreshed and sharpened. The latest maps add 700 trillion pixels of new data to the service.  Google hopes its updated global mosaic will provide users with the crispest cloud-free aerial views of the Earth to date. At the end of July, the app had a subtle makeover to have a 'cleaner look'. For example, areas shaded in orange denote areas of interest (shown left). This makes them easier to find when browsing, while users can zoom in to see more details about each venue in the 'orange zone' (example shown right)   Read more: Google Maps v9.34 Beta adds features to keep maps pointed north, plans to give advice about parking difficulty, and may reveal the return of Launcher Shortcuts [APK Teardown + Download] Share or comment on this article e-mail 31 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Boyfriend plays awful snake prank on his sleeping girlfriend REVEALED: Number of Hamilton stars haven't voted in YEARS...

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama August 5 Follow @htsuka Toy car with luggage on a vintage globe map of the United States with a shallow depth of field. (Michael Quirk/iStock) Google Maps consistently makes lists of the top 10 most-used apps and is probably one app that many people consult daily. But how much of the program do you actually use? Those who just type in an address and go should know that there's so much more you can do than just that. To help you make the most of that last, great summer road trip, we've compiled a list of tips to get more out of Google Maps. Here are some useful features hiding just below the surface. Multistop trips:  Trips aren’t always about going from Point A to Point B. Sometimes there’s a C, D, E or even F you have to get to as well. Google recently started rolling out a new feature that lets you plug in more than one destination at a time. Users can access this by hitting the options menu from the directions screen — you get there by hitting the three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner — and selecting “Add stop.” Keep in mind that you may not see this update yet. (Screengrab from a Samsung Galaxy S6 by Hayley Tsukayama) Use “explore”:  The “Explore” section of Maps is pretty easy to find, but is probably overlooked by those focused on just getting directions. The feature is particularly useful if you’re traveling on business or to a new place and need to grab a quick bite to eat, and don’t have time to wander around aimlessly. From the main search screen, click on the three parallel lines on the left-hand side of the search bar. (Designers call this common icon the “hamburger.”) If you’re zoomed into a reasonably local area, you should see the “Explore” section, which will direct you to good places to eat, cheap places to eat, nearby attractions and more. (Screengrab from an iPhone 6s by Hayley Tsukayama) Download an offline area: If you’re going to be somewhere where you can’t get cell service, take advantage of the ability to download a section of Google Maps to access offline. To do this tap in the search bar and scroll down until you see “Download a new offline area.” Alternatively, you can search for a city and swipe up from the bottom, and then hit the “Download” option. Slide up on the map screen to get the menu that includes the download option. (Screengrab from a Samsung Galaxy S6 by Hayley Tsukayama) Google won’t let you download too large of an area — but you can go up to 120,000 square kilometers. You can interact with this offline section of the map and search for directions to locations within that part of the world. Maps won't suggest places for you, but it will still be more useful than an old-school map. You should know that if you download a part of Google Maps, it will take up storage space on your phone. But it can be convenient, and it’s way easier to transport than a paper map that you'll never be able to refold again. Share directions: Need to let someone else know how to get to where they’re going? Once you have the directions you need, hit the three-dot options menu and tap “Share Directions.” That will let you text or email directions to someone through a link, or even share directions over Twitter or Facebook if you so desire. (Screengrab from an iPhone 6s by Hayley Tsukayama) That’s way easier than reading your phone’s screen to someone, or trying to remember off the top of your head. Besides, your friends are probably just going to put the destination in Google Maps anyway. This feature can save both of you the trouble. Sign-in for better service: If you’re signed in to Maps it adds quite a bit of functionality — though you’re also giving Google’s app more access to your information. Deciding whether the trade-off is worth it is up to you. If you sign in and turn on your history, from that point you’ll be able to reference your past destinations more quickly. So, if you get a restaurant recommendation for a summer trip and then want to go back the following summer, you should be able to do that quickly. (Screengrab from an iPhone 6s by Hayley Tsukayama) Another advantage to signing in is that you can link your Google Contacts to Google Maps, so it’s easy to find your friend Jim’s house by pulling it from your address book. That saves you from having to ask “Where am I going, again?” when you get in the car. You can sign in to your Google Account by hitting the hamburger icon and tapping "Sign in." Know more about what you’re getting into: There are also some settings that most users know about but likely don’t use that often. On the options menu, for example, you can turn on different filters and features to get different information about where you’re headed. If you’re walking in a hilly city such as San Francisco, for example, you may really want to see the terrain around you. A coffee shop may look like it’s just a quick walk and a few blocks away — but those blocks may take you straight up a steep hill. That's vital information to know if you don't want to be out of breath by the time you get there. (Screengrab from an iPhone 6s Hayley Tsukayama) One setting I use a lot that many may find useful is the setting preference to “avoid tolls.” Of course, you can’t always find a toll-free way to get somewhere in the time you need, but it’s still nice to have the option on hand.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Google Chrome for Android 2016: Browser Promises Faster, Smoother Playback and Less Battery Usage By CP Contributor Aug 5, 2016 | 2:11 AM Good news for Android users: Google will be rolling out Chrome 52 this week, and they can expect smoother video playback, faster loading time, and less battery usage to ensure that users get a more enjoyable experience. The new Chrome built itself on Chrome 51, which did away with the Merged Tab feature. Google said that Chrome plays over a billion hours of web video every week on websites such as Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon, and much of it is done on mobile devices. Battery can be affected Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit This stands to reason as mobile browsers are often slow to load, and when video is involved, it's likely to drain much faster than normal. While loading largely depends on internet connection and hardware specification, battery can also be affected by software optimizations, according to the Tech Times. As such, the popular web browser has been tweaked to support Data Saver Mode, which means that a lighter version of your video will be downloaded and played to save nearly half in data consumption. While there are no figures yet, a demo clip showed that videos now start playing sooner and more smoothly. The battery also drains less upon streaming. Changes for desktop Google is also planning the same tweaks for its desktop equivalent. Chrome is notorious for its power issues on Windows, as has been previously pointed out by Microsoft. Meanwhile, Opera and Edge have been claiming superior power over Chrome. Microsoft recently launched a lab-controlled test between Edge, Chrome, and Opera--one in an automated cycle on online browsing on popular site, and another on streaming video content--to demonstrate how quickly Chrome usage drains battery. The test showed that Chrome only ran a little over four hours compared to Microsoft Edge, which ran for seven hours. Windows 10 improvement In a statement to Verge, Google sought to address this issue and is now making 33 percent improvement on video playback on Windows 10, resulting in Chrome 53 being at par with other browsers (Safari, Firefox) in terms of power consumption. So far, these tweaks are all anchored on HTML5 content, which means that videos that use plugins will not see any improvement. Google notes on its blog, however, that most content are shifting to HTML5. Users can enjoy the updates most noticeably on shorter videos, which make up the majority of web video content. Android users can also expect Chrome 53 by September.
