Don’t click suspicious Google Docs link, it’s phishing scam! By: Rohan Pal, The Mobile Indian, New Delhi Last updated : Thursday, May 04, 2017 - 11:18 Google has confirmed that Google Docs users were hit by a massive phishing scam, which tricked them to give away their Gmail accounts to the hackers. If you got an email from somewhere asking you to check the Google Docs file, just don’t click it! It is a phishing scam and you might hand over Gmail account and contacts to hackers.    Google has confirmed that Google Docs users were hit by a massive phishing scam, which tricked them to give away their Gmail accounts to the hackers and has rolled out anti-phishing security checks in Gmail on Android to stop this attack. The phishing attack has been spreading like a wildfire and has targeted around 100 crore users.    The whole scenario came into limelight when multiple users started complaining about the scam on the social media and that they were affected with this type of attack. For those who are not aware, phishing is basically a hacking technique which tricks users to give away the vital information like password, username, and other details by disguising as a trusted entity.      The attackers, in this case, used an already logged-in user to send this malicious link to all his/her contacts posing as a Docs file. So, as soon as the recipient clicks through, they are taken to the rogue Google page, where they are asked to give permission which includes the ability to send, read, delete and manage email, as well as manage contacts. In this way, it also bypasses two-factor authentication as well. Once a user gives all the permissions, thinking it is a valid Docs file, the hackers get the access to Gmail account and the software immediately spam out the same message to all the people on the contact list.    If you are one of those victims and then you should go the Google Permission page immediately and revoke all the permissions given to an app called Google Docs. And for the future, don’t click any suspicious Google Docs file. Though Google has deployed security measures which now automatically blocks the link, but one can also be extra careful and should double check email. The current malicious emails are all addressed to the same ‘hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com’ address.  Google Docs Google Google Suite Google Docs phishing scam Google Docs Google phishing scam Applications First Published : Thursday, May 04, 2017 - 11:18 <a href='http://ade.themobileindian.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2df830c&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://ade.themobileindian.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=2&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a2df830c' border='0' alt='' /></a> Advertisement Similar News Android Nougat now runs on 7.1 percent of active devices Google Maps for India are now better and faster Pixel, Pixel XL end-of-life support announced by Google Google launches neural machine translation for nine Indian languages, integrates Hindi dictionary on Google search Google begins testing of ‘Copyless Paste’ feature on Chrome for Android Upcoming Google Pixel lineup needs to clean up bottlenecks Advertisement Hot Trend on TMI WhatsApp back and running after a massive outage Facebook rolls out ‘Instant Games’ for Messengers worldwide for both iOS and Android users Google Maps for India are now better and faster Now you can pin your favourite chats on top on WhatsApp Samsung Marshmallow is a new Parental Control app and not an Android version WhatsApp asks its users to delete the app if privacy is a concern <a href='http://ade.themobileindian.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a47fefe1&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://ade.themobileindian.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=1&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a47fefe1' border='0' alt='' /></a> Advertisement Product Finder Advertisement FOLLOW US ON Facebook Twitter Google Plus Youtube How To on TMI How to find your lost smartphone in India How to enable YouTube's built-in Dark Mode How to use your Android smartphone camera as webcam How to bring back the old WhatsApp Messenger: Step-by-Step Guide How to enable Google Assistant on your Android smartphone Latest on TMI 01 Apple iPhone 8 to come loaded with MacBook Pro-like Touch Bar known as function area: Report 02 Sony PlayStation 5 may be launched in 2018 03 Honor 6A smartphone expected to launch on May 18 04 Don’t click suspicious Google Docs link, it’s phishing scam! 05 WhatsApp back and running after a massive outage The Mobile Indian Latest Mobiles Zopo Color M5 Rs.5999 Smartron srt.phone 64GB Rs.13999 Smartron srt.phone 32GB Rs.12999 Vivo V5s Rs.18990 Elephone P9000 Rs.11999 Zopo Color M4 Rs.4999 Advertisement   Know Us About Us Advertise Contact Us Privacy Policy Articles News Reviews How To Top 5 Device Finder Mobiles Tablets Laptop Camera TV Refrigetator CONTACT US Contact Us Copyright © 2017 the mobile indian.

Google bakes phishing protection into the Gmail for Android app Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 7:40pm PDTMay 3, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 62 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares147 Applications Google News Perhaps due to today's outbreak of a widespread phishing scam, or simply by coincidence, Google is rolling out enhanced anti-phishing security checks in Gmail for Android. When users tap on a suspicious link, the above warning will now appear. Judging by the page design, this feature appears to use Google's Safe Browsing database, which catalogs sites known to host malware or trick users into giving away information. Ironically, this wouldn't have done anything to prevent the recent phishing outbreak, as the link in that email redirected to a normal Google login page. The change appears to be part of Gmail for Android 7.4.23, which you can grab from APKMirror right now, or wait for the Play Store to roll out the update to you.

Do this By Martin Brinkmann on May 4, 2017 in Google - Last Update:May 4, 2017 1 Yesterday was not a good day for Google. First the Google Drive outage that prevented many Google users from accessing data on the popular file hosting service, and then a new sophisticated phishing that targeted Google users. Just to refresh your memory on that: Gmail users started to get emails in which they were notified that someone shared a document on Google Docs with them. The email included just a single sentence that repeated the invitation, and a blue button to open the document in Docs. Zach Latte posted a gif of the whole process on his Twitter account. A click on the button loaded the Google Accounts website. Users who use multiple accounts on Google are asked to select one to grant permissions. A click on the name of the developer, Google Docs, reveals right on that page that something is not right. Instead of setting an official Google email or address there, third-party developer information was listed on the page. The next page highlights the requested permissions. In this case: Read, send, delete, and manage your email Manage your contacts If you hit allow on the page, you give the attacker access to your Gmail email messages, and all of the contacts. The latter will likely result in even more phishing emails being sent out. The former is highly problematic, especially if you have linked other accounts to the Gmail account email address. A simple example: if you host a website with domain, and use the Gmail address for the account, the attacker could gain access to the account and transfer the domain to another account. If the attacker uses filters on Gmail to hide emails from the hosting company, the transfer may not be detected until it is too late. The main issue with the phishing attack is that the attacker impersonated Google Docs for the attack, something which should have been blocked by Google. What if you granted the account permissions? Google has blocked the account in the meantime, removed the fake pages, and pushed updates to Safe Browsing on top of all that. Google users who gave permissions to the attacker should remove the Google Docs entry from the application permissions page on the Google website. This page highlights all apps that you have granted permissions to. Google recommends that users run the company's Safety Checkup tool on top of this. Now You: Would you have detected the phishing attack? Summary Article Name Fell Prey to Google Docs phishing scam? Do this Description Google users were attacked yesterday in a new sophisticated phishing attack that tried to get access to the account by impersonating as Google Docs.

PHOTO: REUTERS Alphabet warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs after a large number of people turned to social media to complain that their accounts had been hacked. Google said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. Google success in US schools forces Microsoft, Apple to scramble The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. “This is the future of phishing,” said Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc. “It gets attackers to their goal … without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device.” He said the hackers had also pointed some users to another site, since taken down, that sought to capture their passwords. Google said its abuse team “is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” Microsoft unveils Windows 10 S for its Surface laptops Anybody who granted access to the malicious app unknowingly also gave hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. “This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,” said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.

Updated 9 hours ago If you've received an invitation to join a shared Google Doc that you weren't expecting, you might want to steer clear of it. It's probably a phishing scam that could compromise your account. Internet users everywhere are being spammed with what appear to be malicious invitations to log on to their Google accounts. Unlike your garden-variety cyberattack, many of the telltale signs that could tip you off that something is awry are absent. For example, the attack appears to work by tricking you into logging into your actual Google account, then granting a third party (your attacker) access to your account's data. Having gained permission to access your contacts, the attacker then fires off spam invites to everyone in your address book. What makes this attack so tricky to detect is that it takes advantage of Google's legitimate tool for sharing data with responsible third-party apps. Since the bogus invitation is being routed through Google's real system, nothing is misspelled, the icons look accurate, and it's hard to know something's gone wrong until it's too late. Google said Wednesday that it is working to ensure this type of “spoofing” doesn't happen again. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” the company said in a statement. Staff at The Washington Post, students at New York University and even workers at the U.S. Agency for International Development have received warnings from IT administrators not to open the emails. Here is one such notice, obtained by The Post. Here's one clue for identifying the fraudulent email: Included on the string of recipients is an email address that begins “hhhhhhhhhhhhhh” and ends in “mailinator.com,” a website that lets visitors obtain a temporary and disposable email address. So, until you hear otherwise, it's probably best to hold off on any Google Docs usage for now. If you've clicked the link in the malicious email, you can revoke the attacker's access by visiting ... https://myaccount.google.com/permissions More Business Sheetz opening new stores, hiring 3,400 more workers Apple steps up its effort to emphasize its economic impact Stocks dip as media, health care companies fall; banks jump Fed holds key interest rate steady, downplays recent weak economic data Facebook to hire 3,000 to review videos of crime and suicide TribLIVE commenting policy You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

Companies are buying wind and solar power the traditional way—from utilities—but some of the richest, most sophisticated corporations, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, are building their own projects or buying electricity in bulk directly from project developers. Now, a Seattle startup is extending that direct purchasing opportunity to smaller corporations. Many of them covet clean energy for the same economic and environmental reasons as their larger peers. But the smaller companies often don’t need all the energy from an entire large-scale solar or wind project, or they may lack the expertise to execute a long-term, bulk power purchase contract. Bryce Smith, founder and CEO of LevelTen Energy, which just completed the Techstars Seattle startup accelerator, says the company is what you’d get “if Match.com and [mutual fund giant] Vanguard had a baby that really cared about renewable energy.” Smith, who previously co-founded and led Seattle-based solar power project developer OneEnergy Renewables, says the emergence of the corporate customer has been a welcome development for the renewable energy industry, providing a creditworthy power buyer that banks require before they finance project development. But the industry has yet to overcome a series of challenges inherent in the traditional contracting and financing practices for power projects to tap the potential of a broader pool of corporate power buyers, he says. LevelTen CEO Bryce Smith. “It was a great idea,” Smith says. “Companies want to buy renewables and developers want to sell renewables, but the challenge was how do you bring them together in a way that actually gets transactions done? That wasn’t happening. It was more aspirational.” There are a host of roadblocks: Power purchase agreements are complex and bespoke. Wholesale electricity markets are esoteric. Most corporate power buyers don’t have the in-house expertise to shop for power on a project-by-project basis. And even if they did, their companies may not have enough energy demand to consume the output of the big projects that offer the most competitive prices. Then there’s the risk inherent in putting all your energy eggs into one basket. LevelTen’s bet is that many of the risks and shortcomings inherent in the old one-to-one model can be overcome by selling the output of many projects to many corporate buyers. Smith says the corporate market has been primed by tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, which have watched their electricity use grow as they open data centers around the globe to provide cloud computing services. At the same time, they’ve committed to aggressive renewable energy targets. Google, for example, says it will operate on 100 percent renewable energy this year. Amazon Web Services set a target of 50 percent renewable energy by the end of the year, halfway to its eventual goal of being entirely powered by renewable energy. Microsoft already counts itself as fully carbon free, thanks to renewable energy power purchase agreements and the purchase of carbon offsets. Environmental motivations remain a strong driver. Nearly half of the companies in the Fortune 500 have a clean energy or climate-related target, according to a report issued last week by the World Wildlife Fund. But the economics of renewable energy have become even more compelling. Smith notes that utility-scale solar power projects are already competing with fossil-fuel power plants, a threshold that the Department of Energy’s SunShot initiative sought to achieve by 2020. The wind industry, which has been the go-to power source for corporate renewable energy purchasers, has seen a steady reduction in its power contract prices since 2009. Those cost reductions are in large part the result of state-level renewable energy mandates, which created demand among utilities over the last two decades. While still important, the mandates are not driving corporate interest. Likewise, a reversal of federal climate policy under the Trump administration is unlikely to dissuade corporate renewable energy purchasers, Smith says. “The climate issue is settled science and companies know that,” he says. “But it’s not just an environmental issue. It’s an economic issue.” Wind and solar power projects can already compete with electricity from coal and natural-gas fueled power plants in many U.S. electricity markets. But renewables have another advantage over fossil fuels: long-term price stability. Since wind and sun are free, renewable power producers can offer fixed-price electricity contracts with terms from 10 to 25 years, allowing energy-hungry corporations to manage a large expense with more certainty, Smith says. The median price of 24 wind power contracts signed from 2014 to 2016 is below the low-end estimates of the cost of power from natural gas power plants through 2040, according to the latest Wind Technologies Market Report from the Department of Energy (PDF). Smith says corporations are expected to commit $100 billion to renewable energy by 2025. To tap into this corporate demand, LevelTen is creating what Smith likens to a “mutual fund” of renewable energy projects. LevelTen is selling custom-sized slices of a portfolio of renewable energy projects it selects with the input of a risk-and-value algorithm based on millions of daily power prices and project attributes. It’s first portfolio will include four new wind and solar projects with the capacity to produce 400 megawatts of electricity. Those projects are expected to generate $700 million in electricity revenue over the 15-year life of the portfolio, Smith says. LevelTen, which raised a seed round in 2016 from Seattle-based investors Founders’ Co-op and cleantech focused angel group Element 8, makes money by charging corporate customers a management fee—a small percentage of the cost of the electricity contracted. LevelTen’s model is designed for deregulated electricity markets, which now cover most of the country (though not the Pacific Northwest). Without getting too deep into the workings of wholesale electricity markets, LevelTen is contracting for the renewable attributes of each project in its portfolio. The electrons produced by a given solar panel or wind turbine pour into a regional grid, displacing power generated from other sources. “What matters is what you cause to be dumped into the grid,” Smith says. “There are no brown or green electrons. They’re just electrons. If you cause renewable electrons to be dumped onto the grid, you are by definition backing out whatever else comes on at the margin. You’re backing fossil-based generation.” Transmission and distribution utilities still deliver the electricity to the corporate customers, and get paid for that service. That’s important, because as demand for electricity surges in areas where companies concentrate data centers, utilities need to continue investing in transmission infrastructure. (See the recent case of Prineville, OR, where Apple and Facebook server farms are overloading existing substations, prompting the Bonneville Power Administration to add new capacity.) Utilities are awake to the renewable energy demand among their corporate customers. Earlier this month, Washington’s largest investor-owned utility, Puget Sound Energy, unveiled a program called Green Direct. It bears many similarities to LevelTen’s approach, providing large customers the option of a long-term, fixed-price contract for electricity from renewable sources within PSE’s portfolio. Some 60 percent of PSE’s electricity is generated by coal- and natural gas-fueled power plants. The costs associated with the renewable slice of the portfolio are passed on to the Green Direct customers, who are also insulated from price fluctuations that may impact PSE’s broader customer base over time. Initial Green Direct customers include REI, Sound Transit, Starbucks, King County, and other municipalities and corporations. Smith says programs like Green Direct validate what LevelTen is doing. “It’s good to see the utilities and [regulators] be responsive to that desire to have broader choice,” he says.

According to online reports - in particular, a detailed user thread on Reddit - clicking on an emailed share link, purportedly from a known source, was taking users to a site that asked permission for a fake app calling itself "Google Docs" to access their accounts. If they agreed, the app would then send additional copies of the original email to the users' contacts. Earlier reports suggested the attack was a phishing scam potentially aimed at harvesting personal information and maybe even Google login credentials. But in a statement late Wednesday, Google said that while the campaign accessed and used contact information, no other data was apparently exposed. Google said it was able to stop the campaign in about an hour. It has disabled offending accounts, removed fake pages and updated its Safe Browsing feature, which issues warnings when users visit dangerous sites. Users don't have to take additional action, although Google encouraged those who want to be extra safe to run its security check feature. One telltale sign for identifying the spam email: It appears to be directed to the address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com, and is only blind copied to the recipient.

Designing Voice Experiences By Lyndon Cerejo May 3rd, 2017 AccessibilityUI 0 Comments Voice-based interfaces are becoming commonplace. Voice assistants such as Siri and Cortana have been around for a few years, but this past holiday season, voice-driven devices from Amazon and Google made their way into millions of homes. Recent analysis from VoiceLabs1 estimates that 24.5 million voice-driven devices will be shipped this year, almost four times as many as last year. As experience designers, we now have the opportunity to design voice experiences and interfaces! A new interface does not mean that we have to disregard everything we have successfully applied to previous interfaces; we will need to adapt our process for the nuances of voice-driven interfaces, including conversational interactions and the lack of a screen. We will look at how a typical genie in a bottle works, discuss the steps involved in designing voice experiences, and illustrate these steps by designing a voice app for Alexa (or Skill, as Amazon calls it). Further Reading on SmashingMag: Link Enhancing User Experience With The Web Speech API2 Guidelines For Designing With Audio3 Experimenting With speechSynthesis4 What Is User Experience Design? Overview, Tools And Resources5 Understanding Voice Interfaces Link Just as mobile apps run on an OS and a device, three layers have to work together to enable voice interactions: 6 The layers that enable voice interactions voice app (Amazon Skills and Actions for Google); artificial intelligence platform (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana); device (Echo, Home, smartphones, computers). Each layer uses the one below and supports the one above it. The voice interface lies in the upper two layers, both of which reside in the cloud, not on the device itself. Let’s peek under the hood to see how these layers work together, using the Alexa Jeopardy! Skill as an example. 7 The layers that enable voice interactions. (View large version8) Voice-driven devices such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home are constantly listening, waiting for a wake word (“Alexa…” or “OK, Google…”) to jump into action. Once activated, the device sends the audio that follows to the AI platform in the cloud (“… play Jeopardy!”). The platform uses a combination of automatic speech recognition9 (ASR) and natural language understanding10 (NLU) to decipher the user’s intent (to start a trivia game) and send it to the supporting app (Jeopardy! J6 Skill on Alexa). The app processes the request and responds through text (and a visual if applicable). The platform converts the text to speech and plays it through the device (“Welcome to Jeopardy J6. Here are today’s clues…”). All this in matter of seconds. Building Voice Experiences Link Last year, Mark Zuckerberg took on a personal challenge to build a simple AI11 to run his home. He did, called it Jarvis and gave it the voice of Morgan Freeman12. 13 Mark Zuckerberg introduces Morgan Freeman to the AI that uses his voice. (Image: Mark Zuckerberg14) The rest of us who don’t have the ability or resources to do the same can get away with building voice apps that run on complex AI platforms that have already been built. This frees us to only have to worry about the design and development of the voice app, that too with a simplified development process. Amazon15 and Google16 have provided open access to templates, code, and detailed step-by-step instructions to build different types of voice apps, to the point that even non-developers could develop an app in around an hour! Their investment in simplifying app development is paying off, with thousands of new voice apps being launched every month17. The growth in voice apps brings back memories of the ’90s web gold rush, as well as the explosion of mobile apps that followed the launch of app stores. 18 Breakdown of Alexa Skills by category as of May 2017. (View large version19) In a crowded voice marketplace, good design is what will differentiate your voice app from the hundreds of other similar apps. Designing Voice Experiences Link Designing a good voice user experience is a five-step process that should take place before starting development. Though jumping straight into development might be tempting, the time spent getting the design right is time well spent. 20 The steps in designing voice experiences (View large version21) We will discuss and apply each step to design a voice app, which could easily be developed using one of many Skill templates for Alexa22. 1. Discover Link The design journey begins with the question, “How will this voice app provide value to my users?” This question applies whether you are developing a standalone voice app (like our example) or whether your voice app is just one of many touchpoints for your customers. Take into consideration why and where people use voice apps. People use voice interfaces because of the benefits of hands-free interaction, the speed of interaction and the ease of use, primarily using it at home or in the car, as shown in Mary Meeker’s 2016 Internet Trends Report23. 24 Top reasons to use voice interfaces (callouts by author) (Source: KPCB25) (View large version26) The key is to find consistent user needs that are easier or more convenient through a voice app rather than a phone or a computer. Some examples include banks providing account information or a moviegoer finding new movies playing nearby. If you have competitors who already have voice apps, take into consideration what they are doing and the reviews and feedback their apps have received in the app marketplace (such as Amazon’s Alexa Skill Store27). The aim is not to blindly imitate, but to be aware of the capabilities bar that has been set, as well as user expectations. (At the time of writing this, there were over 1,500 “knowledge and trivia” Alexa Skills, making it the most crowded Skill categories on Amazon. However, there wasn’t a single trivia skill catering to the area of user experience. To illustrate the voice design process, we will create a UX design skill, for our readers to test their knowledge or maybe even to learn something new.) 2. Define Link During this step, we will define the personality of our app and the capabilities it will have. Personality Link When designing voice interfaces, we don’t have access to many of the visual elements we use in web and mobile interfaces to show a personality. The personality has to come through the voice and tone of verbal interactions. And unlike Zuckerberg, who hears Freeman’s soothing voice, we are constrained to hearing the default voice of the device. That makes tone and wording crucial in conveying the personality we want to convey. The good news is that most of the groundwork in this area should have already been completed and documented in a corporate brand guide or website style guide (hint: look for the “tone of voice” section). Leverage those guidelines for your voice app, as well to maintain a consistent personality across channels and touchpoints. When I think of personality and tone, the Virgin Group immediately comes to mind. They clearly define who they are and how they convey that to users. For Virgin America, the ideal tone is “hip, easygoing, informal, playful and tongue in cheek,” and it comes across clearly in all their communication. 28 Virgin America’s brand personality (Source: Virgin America29) If you’ve ever asked Alexa to sing or tried any of the numerous Alexa Easter Eggs30, then you’ll know she has a personality of her own. Curious, I reached out to the team responsible for her personality, and here’s what they had to say: When architecting Alexa’s voice, we tried to give her a personality that reflects the attributes we value most at Amazon. We wanted her to feel helpful, humble and smart, while still maintaining a sense of fun. This is an ongoing process, and we expect the voice of Alexa will evolve as more developers focus on making her smarter. Personality can also be reflected in the app’s name, icon and description that are displayed to users in the app directory listing, as well as in the name used to invoke the app (the invocation name). So, make sure it shines through while publishing your app. For our UX Design skill, we could take a straightforward or a funny approach, and that would be reflected in the wording of our quiz’ Q&A options. An example of a normal tone would be: Which UX design principle favors simplicity over complexity? Occam’s Razor Hick’s Law Aesthetic-usability effect Satisficing And an example of a funny tone would be: Apparently, there’s a UX design principle that favors simplicity over complexity. Really! Can you guess what it’s called? Occam’s Razor: The best a UX guy can get. Hick’s Law: Sounds like something a UX bumpkin would come up with. Aesthetic-usability effect: That’s some fancy UX jargon. Satisficing: I can’t get no satisficing… apologies to the Rolling Stones. Yeah, let’s stick with normal. Capabilities Link This is where you carefully think of the functionality that will be valuable for your voice app’s users. Revisit your work from the first step to identify the capabilities that are core or related to your business. Sometimes offering core capabilities is a no-brainer — such as a bank offering information on balance, transactions and due dates. Others offer value in the form of related features, such as Tide’s stain-removal guide voice app, or Glad’s (makers of food storage and trash bags) voice apps, one of which helps users to remember where they stored their leftovers, or the other one that allows users to check which items should be recycled or disposed of in the trash. If you did a similar exercise when going from web to mobile, that can serve as a starting point. For voice capabilities, consider what capabilities would benefit your users on a voice-driven device in a shared space. If a Skill has security or privacy implications, consider adding a level of protection (the Capital One Alexa Skill allows users to create a personal key for account access). While you may end up with a laundry list of functionality that would work over voice, start with one to five core capabilities, and use voice analytics to update and improve after launch. The core capabilities of a UX design Skill could be: provide a UX design principle on demand; quiz the user (single player) on a random UX principle; quiz the user (single player) on multiple UX principle, and keep score; hold a UX quiz competition with multiple players. Because we are building this UX design Skill using Amazon’s Skill templates, our choices are currently restricted to either the first (fact skill template) or third (trivia skill template) option above. Assuming that our research has shown that our users would find a quiz more valuable than just hearing a UX principle recited, our core capability will be to quiz the user on UX principles and to keep score. 3. Detail Conversation Flow Link Now that you have shortlisted the capabilities of your voice app, start focusing on the detailed conversation flow that the app will have with its users. Human conversation is complex; it often has many twists and turns and may pivot anytime, with people often jumping from one topic to another. Voice AI platforms still have a long way to go to match that level of complexity, so you have to teach your Skill how to respond to users. Your voice app can only support the capabilities you have defined in the previous step, but users always have the ability to ask the app anything and in any format. Detailing a conversation flow allows you to respond to the user, or to drive the conversation towards what the app can do for the user. For each capability that the voice app will support, start creating conversational dialogues between the user and the app, similar to dialogues in a screenplay. As you write these dialogues, remember the personality as well as voice and tone characteristics. Start creating and curating the actual content for your voice app; for our quiz, this would mean building the list of quiz questions. Begin with the “happy path” — a conversational flow in which the voice app can respond to the user’s request without any exceptions or errors. Then, move on to detailing the conversational flow for exceptions (in which the user does not provide complete information) and errors (in which the voice app does not understand or cannot do what the user is asking). Because the conversation will be heard and not read, a good practice is to read it out loud to see if it sounds like a natural spoken conversation, and to check that it conveys the tone of voice you’ve intended. If your voice app needs to supplement the conversation with content displayed on the phone app, design these interactions together, so that they appear seamless to the user. For instance, Tide’s stain-removal Skill informs the user that they could also refer to the stain-removal steps in the Alexa app, in addition to hearing the instructions. This may soon be required if the rumors of a touchscreen on the new Echo31 are true. Here is a sample dialogue for the happy path our UX design Skill’s core capability: User: “Alexa, start the UX design quiz.” Alexa: “I will ask you five questions, with multiple choice answers. Try to get as many right as you can. Just say the number of the answer. Let’s begin. Question 1…” User: [responds correctly] Alexa: “That’s correct! Your score is 1. Here’s question 2…” User: [responds incorrectly] Alexa: “Oops, that’s the wrong answer. The correct answer is [correct answer]. Your score is 1. Here’s question 3…” … Alexa (at the end of five questions): “That’s correct! You got four out of five questions correct. Thank you for playing!” 4. Describe Alternate Phrases Link People don’t always use the same words to say the same thing, and voice apps need to be taught that. Phrase-mapping is an exercise to teach voice apps to accommodate variation in the way users phrase their requests. For each conversational path that you detailed in the previous step, think about the different ways users could word those requests. Then break down the wording of each request, and identify word variations and synonyms that they might use, taking into account any regional variations and dialects. You will have your hands full if your voice app deals with sweetened carbonated beverages (soda, pop, coke, tonic, soft drink, fizzy drink), long sandwiches (sub, grinder, hoagie, hero, poor boy, bomber, Italian sandwich, baguette) or athletic footwear (sneakers, shoes, gym shoes, sand shoes, jumpers, tennis shoes, running shoes, runners, trainers). Make this list of variations as complete and exhaustive as possible, so that your voice app can understand user requests. Alexa needs these variations in the form of “utterances” and recommends providing “… as many representative phrases as possible32.” Depending on the capabilities of your voice app, the number of utterances could easily run into the hundreds, but there are ways to simplify the generation of utterances33. Here’s a sample phrase-mapping for a capability of our UX design quiz. Alexa’s AI platform does a good job of translating user intent for Skills based on their templates. However, if you make changes (like we changed “trivia game” to “quiz”), then these phrases will have to be added. 34 View large version35 5. Refine Link The final step in the design process is to validate and refine the voice application before spending time and effort on development. During the “detail” step, reading the conversation flows aloud helped to make sure that they sounded natural and conversational. The current step involves testing the voice interface with users. The simplest way to test is using the Wizard of Oz technique, with a person playing the role of the voice-driven device and responding to the user based on the voice interface script. Another option is to use prototyping software such as SaySpring6236 to create and test interactive prototypes. If your voice app is being built using code templates (as our app is), then it might be easier to create the app and test it using testing tools provided by Amazon37 and Google38 within the Skill development area (as shown below), or in test mode on an actual device. 39 This testing will give you a good feel for the voice experience in the real world, including handling of errors, repetitive responses, and unnatural, forced or machine-like replies. Develop Link Now that the voice experience has been designed, it is time to move to the build-test-submit phase. Each platform has detailed guides and tutorials to help anyone build and test skills, including Alexa Skills Kit40, Develop Actions for Google41, and Cortana42, which offers to reuse your custom Alexa skill code! Think about your feedback loop and the analytics that will help you to understand usage of your voice app. You can get Skill metrics (users, sessions, utterances, intents) within your developer account without any additional coding, but advanced analytics are available through free services such as VoiceLabs43 (I could not get it to work, probably due to my lack of coding skills or the lack of a VoiceLabs for Dummies setup guide). After you finish building and testing your voice app, the last step is a streamlined submission process44. Because the Alexa Skill marketplace has rapidly grown, discovering new and useful apps is getting difficult. Until Amazon improves this, use visible elements of your voice app listing to help users find and try your Skill, including a catchy and relevant skill icon, name and description. The companion skill that was built as an illustration can be taken for a test drive on the Amazon Alexa Skill store: UX Design Quiz45 Guiding Principles Link Here are a few guiding principles for designing voice experiences. More principles and detailed do’s and don’ts are offered by Amazon46 and Google47. Onboard the User and Help Them Get Started Link Introduce the app and the ways the user can engage with it. Welcome to UX Design Quiz. I will ask you five questions about UX design and see how many you get right. You can ask me to repeat a question or pause if you need to. Would you like to start a new quiz? Keep conversation exchanges brief to reduce cognitive load. Link With a voice user interface, the user has to use their short-term memory while interacting with the voice app. So, keep it short and sweet. Alexa: “This principle is attributed to a 14th-century logician and Franciscan friar and is named after the village in the English county of Surrey where he was born. In a nutshell, it states that simplicity is better than complexity. This problem-solving principle can easily be applied to user experience design, by going for the simpler design solution. What is this principle called? Your first option is Occam’s Razor, sometimes known as Ockham’s razor, or the law of parsimony. Your next option is Hick’s Law, also known as the Hick-Hyman Law. Your next option is the aesthetic-usability effect. Your last option is called “satisficing,” not to be confused with “satisfying” or “sacrificing.” Please say A, B, C, or D to make your selection.” User: “Huh?! Alexa, repeat. On second thought, end quiz!” Examples Work Better Than Instructions Link Instruction: “Please say your date of birth in the month/day/year format.” Example: “Please say your date of birth, like April 15, 1990.” Delight Without Interfering With the Task Link This is a balancing act. Too much and it gets tiresome quickly. Use Explicit Confirmations for Important Actions, and Implicit for Less Risky Link If you ask Alexa to turn off the lights, you can see it happen and do not need a verbal confirmation, although she sometimes confirms with a short “OK.” 48 User feedback for the Glad Leftover Skill highlights two principles above. Design for Failure Link Things will go wrong: design for those situations. Examples include unintelligible questions or information, incomplete information, silence or requests that cannot be handled. Acknowledge, and give the user options to recover. Respect the User’s Privacy and Security Link 49 User feedback for a bank Skill highlights issues with security, despite passing Alexa Skill Security requirements50. Conclusion Link Anytime you’re dealing with trying to interact with a human, you have to think of humans as very advanced operating systems. Your highest goal is to try to emulate them. – K.K Barrett, Her movie production designer, Wired, 2014 If you haven’t seen the movie Her, take a couple of hours to watch this futuristic movie about a lonely writer who develops a relationship with an operating system. While it is science fiction, in today’s world, voice experiences are increasing with the adoption of standalone voice-driven devices, such as the Amazon Echo family and Google Home. Developing a voice app is a relatively simple, template-driven process, with IKEA-like instructions provided by Amazon and Google in an attempt to establish their platforms. Though jumping into development may be tempting, a good voice user experience doesn’t just happen; it has to be designed, going through the steps described in this article.

(Image: Reuters) Google is warning users to beware of a phishing scam spread by a fraudulent invitation to share a Google Doc. According to online reports - in particular, a detailed user thread on Reddit - clicking on the share link was taking users to a site that asked permission for a fake app calling itself "Google Docs" to access their accounts. If they agreed, the app would then send additional phishing emails to the users' contacts.

It appears a number of people have been victims of the phishing attack that sends a user’s Gmail information along with contacts to hackers. Gmail put out a statement on Twitter saying the company has taken action “to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs…” Meanwhile, Gmail has asked users not to click Google Docs link and report the same as phishing within Gmail. In a series of tweets, Gmail posted a Security Check-up link as well for affected users. We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail. — Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 Apparently, users have been getting malicious mails with link to a Google Doc file, clicking on which opens up a Google.com page that seems authentic at first. The page then asks users to authorise ‘Google Docs’ to access to their Gmail account. However, the link isn’t legit as it gives hackers access to information stored in people’s Gmail accounts. According to a report in BuzzFeed news, some of these malicious mails were addressed to ‘hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com’ with the receiver’s address in BCC. The mails sent out by fake Google Docs app share uncanny resemblance to original Gmail mails, which can be easily mistaken for actual Docs link shared by a contact. The good thing is that user’s personal information won’t be shared with hackers unless they give permissions for several privacy features after clicking on fake Docs link. BuzzFeed quoted a Google spokesperson who told the site that the company was able to stop phishing campaign within an hour, as well as disabled the accounts where the hack originated. “We’ve pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail,” the statement reads. Further, Google spokesperson was quoted saying the phishing attack affected 0.1 per cent of a total of 1 billion Gmail users. The search giant will now redirect users to different page when people click on malicious Docs link. They will be taken to a page that reads, “We’re sorry…but your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect our users, we can’t process your request right now.” As always users, should make sure not to click on any suspicious links you receive in your email. Any mail claiming to be from the bank asking for credit card details or any other personal information need to go into your Spam folder immediately.

According to online reports — in particular, a detailed user thread on Reddit — clicking on an emailed share link, purportedly from a known source, was taking users to a site that asked permission for a fake app calling itself “Google Docs” to access their accounts. If they agreed, the app would then send additional copies of the original email to the users’ contacts. Earlier reports suggested the attack was a phishing scam potentially aimed at harvesting personal information and maybe even Google login credentials. But in a statement late Wednesday, Google said that while the campaign accessed and used contact information, no other data was apparently exposed. Google said it was able to stop the campaign in about an hour. It has disabled offending accounts, removed fake pages and updated its Safe Browsing feature, which issues warnings when users visit dangerous sites.

By India Ashok May 4, 2017 05:38 BST The self-propagating feature of the fake Google Docs app ensured that the attacks spread like wildfire in a very short timeiStock A massive phishing scam hit Google account holders on Wednesday (3 May). The first wave of attacks reportedly hit journalists, businesses and universities before spreading to other users. The attack reportedly involved victims receiving an email from a friend or someone they know, which came with a malicious Google docs attachment. When clicked on, the link redirected victims to a Google docs fake app, which was designed to hijack accounts. According to reports, the fake Google docs app requested users to authorise it to access shared documents. However, in reality, the fake malicious app sought access to victims' Gmail inbox and contacts list. Motherboard reported that the fake app came with self-propagating capabilities and automatically sent out more emails to other users. The self-propagating feature ensured that the attacks spread like wildfire in a very short time. Reports indicated that the attack, which was first reported in a Reddit thread, was highly sophisticated. The fake Google docs app had been designed to accurately replicate an authentic one. ArsTechnica reported that the only way to figure out that the email was part of a scam campaign was to click on the down arrow next to the Google docs name. Clicking on this revealed that the developer was not Google but a random individual using the email "eugene.pupov@gmail.com." Motherboard reported that Google Drive was also down at the time of the attacks. However, it is unclear if the outage was related to the attack in any way. However, it took Google a mere hour after users began reporting the attacks on social media, to pull up their sleeves and get cracking on fixing the issue. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," Google said in a statement. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again." How to stay safe? In case you already clicked on the malicious link, fret not, there is a way to fix the issue. Go to the permissions page in your Google account and revoke access to Google Docs by locating the fake Google Docs app. The fake app should have a recent "Authorisation Time". Click on the app and then click on "Remove." This process ensures that infected victims can manually remove the malicious app. "The importance of this phish is not how it spread, but rather how it didn't use malware or fake websites tricking users to give up their passwords," Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at the phishing research and defense company PhishMe, which analyzed data from the fake Google Docs campaign, told Wired. "This phish worked because it tricked the user into granting permissions to a third-party application. This is the future of phishing, and every security technology vendor is ill-equipped to deal with it." Higbee's comments highlight that it is more important than ever for users to be aware of emerging cyberthreats and to incorporate safe security practices when dealing with emails. It also becomes highly imperative for users to know how to spot fake emails. For a quick, comprehensive guide on how to identify fake emails and stay safe from phishing campaigns, click here.

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You SAN FRANCISCO - In the fight over the future of self-driving vehicles, a bare-knuckled brawl between Uber and Waymo is coming to a head. That was clear in a federal courthouse in San Francisco on Wednesday as the two companies clashed at a crucial hearing in a case that could halt the progress of Uber's autonomous-vehicle research efforts. The hearing was expected to be the final court session before a federal judge decides whether to temporarily shut down Uber's work on self-driving cars. At the center of the dispute are allegations by Waymo, the self-driving car unit spun off by Google's parent company, that Uber was using stolen trade secrets to develop autonomous vehicles. The thief, Waymo maintains, is Anthony Levandowski, a former top Google engineer whose startup was acquired by Uber last year to work on self-driving technology. Waymo has accused Levandowski of illegally downloading 14,000 documents from Google and then applying those stolen secrets at Uber. On Wednesday, lawyers for Waymo argued that Levandowski had reached an understanding with Uber before he left Google. To keep that agreement secret from Google, the Waymo lawyers said, Levandowski and Uber needed some cover, so they hatched a plan for Levandowski to create a self-driving-car startup named Otto, which Uber would then acquire. "In fact, there was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Mr. Levandowski had a deal," Charles Verhoeven, a lawyer for Waymo, said. Uber, which has denied stealing Waymo's technology, said there was no evidence that any stolen Waymo files had touched Uber's servers. "We've interviewed more than 85 Uber employees, and more than 40 attorneys spent more than 6,000 hours reviewing documents, including over weekends," Arturo Gonzalez, a lawyer for Uber, said. "After reviewing more than 300,000 documents, we've only found one Google email in the files." The case will be decided by Judge William Alsup of US District Court, who is expected to issue a ruling within the week. Waymo has asked for a temporary injunction blocking Uber's self-driving car efforts; such an order would affect hundreds of Uber's highly skilled engineers. At stake is what Uber and Waymo both believe could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity in the transportation industry in which autonomous cars move people around without the need or expense of human drivers. The two companies have been regarded as leaders in driverless technology, a field that has become crowded in recent years as Apple, General Motors, Tesla and dozens of other companies have flooded in. More than 30 companies have applied to test driverless cars in California, which is at the forefront of addressing regulatory issues raised by such vehicles. There has been little love between Uber and Google in the past, with the companies tangling over issues like mapping technology and hiring. Waymo's lawsuit against Uber is one of the most tangible manifestations of the enmity between the two. Waymo, which was spun off by Google's parent company, Alphabet, last year, sued Uber in February. Uber has repeatedly denied the accusations and has separately sought to take the matter to arbitration. Levandowski said last week that he would stop working on Uber's Lidar system - a shorthand term for light detection and ranging technology, a key hardware component in the operation of autonomous vehicles - for the duration of the case. Waymo's lawyers opened the proceedings Wednesday by pointing to documents and emails uncovered during the case. The documents include correspondence between Uber executives discussing the acquisition of Levandowski's startup in early 2016 while he was still working for Google, Waymo's lawyers said. The documents also show Uber agreeing to grant Levandowski more than 5.3 million company shares, with an estimated value of more than $250 million, in exchange for meeting various technical milestones and project goals should he join Uber. Uber's lawyers argued there was no proof that the company had used any Waymo trade secrets. Alsup said Wednesday that Waymo's lawyers had presented strong evidence that Levandowski had downloaded troves of valuable information from Google before leaving the company and had tried to erase his tracks after doing so. He also said Uber had determined at some point that Levandowski was "radioactive" and had taken steps to insulate itself from any repercussions he might face. Yet Alsup also indicated that Waymo's lawyers might not have proved that there was a direct link between Levandowski's actions and Uber's products. "I've already given you lots of time for discovery, and you don't seem to have a smoking gun," he said to Waymo's lawyers. Waymo's lawyers said they believed that there might be additional evidence that Levandowski had shared the company's technology with Uber and had used it in Uber designs, but that Uber was withholding that evidence. Waymo's lawyers also said that Levandowski could offer similar proof were he willing to cooperate in a deposition. Levandowski, apparently seeking to avoid criminal charges, has invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.

As detailed on Reddit, the attack sends targets an emailed invitation from someone they may know, takes them to a real Google sign-in screen, then asks them to “continue to Google Docs.” But this grants permissions to a (malicious) third-party web app that’s simply been named “Google Docs,” which gives phishers access to your email and address book. The key difference between this and a very simple email phishing scheme is that this doesn’t just take you to a bogus Google page and collect your password — something you could detect by checking the page URL. It works within Google’s system, but takes advantage of the fact that you can create a non-Google web app with a misleading name.

A specific email, shown above, has been making waves in the news and Google has released an official statement regarding it. First, you may be wondering why this specific message is worth talking about. First, it looks identical to normal Google Docs invitation emails. When the 'Open in Docs' link is clicked, the user is asked to give "Google Docs" access to their Google account. Essentially, someone made a web app that identifies itself as Google Docs, easily tricking anyone not paying close attention. @zeynep Just got this as well.

I got an e-mail from my "bank" the other day, with lots of grammatical errors and misspellings, asking me for my credit card number and login information. Man, my bank really screwed up there! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again" That's what they should have done in the first place. WayneEDay You should tell Google you want a refund. ethd Contrary to popular belief, Google is not psychic. Alexithymia I see you trolling around here often shitting Google. Why are you even here reading AP? Getting entertainment from the comments? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm sorry. I didn't realize only Google fanboys were allowed to read AP. Zsolt V Moron, nobody is complaining about your reading, but about your trolling and idiotic posts. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I quote, "Why are you even here reading AP?" If you don't like my comments, block me, get some crayons and a coloring book, go to your safe space and wear a safety pin. Zsolt V Nah, I love calling out morons like you. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And I like calling out Google fanboy morons like you. So we're here for the same kind of fun, just on different sides. The difference is that I don't take people like you seriously enough to get upset. That's why I'm happier than you are. Doby Gillis Ohh the retard is back. Zsolt V Yes, moron, they forgot the"Fix all future vulnerabilities" step in the release process. xyz Fortunately, I don't use Google Docs.

The fast spreading phishing attack has targeted around 100 crore users.  We've addressed the issue with a phishing email claiming to be Google Docs. If you think you were affected, visit https://t.co/O68nQjFhBL. pic.twitter.com/AtlX6oNZaf— Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 Google has confirmed it has now fixed the phishing attack and they are working on preventing similar attacks moving forward. The phishing attacked asked users to click on the fake Google Doc link to view a document following which they are taken to a real Google page prompting you to select an account following which they are taken to a new page asking that they allow “Google Docs” to access the account. The attack bypasses two-factor authentication and login alerts. This provides the hackers access to the contents of their Google accounts, including email, contacts and online documents. Take a look at this Reddit post to know more about the phishing attack. If you did happen to click on the malicious link and allowed attackers into your account, you can revoke that access by heading to Google permissions page. You can just revoke the permission to the app titled Google Docs and then change your password. Meanwhile, Google has released a new security feature in Gmail on Android for a safer email experience. When you click on a suspicious link in a message, Gmail will show a warning prompt helping you keep your account safe. Google is advising users to be extra careful about clicking on links in messages that you are not sure about.

A new email phishing scam involving Google Docs is circulating through people's inboxes. The scam was first reported on Wednesday, where users are sent an email with an invitation to open what appears to be a Google Doc. Clicking on the document (WARNING: Do not click the link!) link brings up what looks like an official page where users can enter their login information for their Google account, allowing for your information to be compromised. @zeynep Just got this as well.

We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail.— Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 If you are one of the users who did click the link, Mashable suggests doing the following: If you did happen to click on the malicious link and allowed attackers into your account, you can revoke that access relatively easily. First, go to your Google permissions page. There you will find a list of all the apps that have account access. One app, titled Google Docs, is the offender. Revoke its permission immediately, and then change your password. Wednesday afternoon, Google tweeted an official statement saying they've taken action to protect users and are working "to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again."

The scam masquerades as Google Docs to gain access to your contacts and address book. It starts with an email that appears to be from one of your contacts. The email invites you to edit a document on Google Docs. The link in the email is “somewhat suspicious,” according to one Redditor who almost fell victim to the ploy, but is “still reasonably Google based.” Clicking on the link takes you to a real Google login screen where you can select the account with which you want to login to Google Docs. Once logged in, it prompts you to continue to Google Docs. This is where the effects of the scam take place. When you click the link, you are asked to grant permission to Google Docs to “Read, send, delete, and manage your email” and to “Manage your contacts.” Doing this grants permission to a “malicious third-party.” The Verge reports that the thing asking for permissions is nothing more than a web app named “Google Docs.” The reason it is so tricky is that the login page that it takes you to is an actual Google login screen, so looking at the URL does not give it away. The only real clue that it is not what it appears to be is the email address that is linked to the developer credentials of the bogus app. JakeSteam on Reddit says that if you “click ‘Google Docs,' it shows [you] it's actually published by a random gmail account, so that user would receive full access to [your] emails.” @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 It is not known how far this scam was spread, but it raised eyebrows across the web due to the sheer number of people that appear to have received the emails. Google has since tweeted it has put the situation under control by disabling offending accounts, removing the fake pages, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, among others. If you have fallen for the scheme, go to Google’s “Connected Apps and Sites” page and revoke privileges from the app called "Google Docs." In the meantime, be cautious of emails asking to share a Google document with you, even if it is from a trusted contact. Check first and be sure they are the ones who sent it.

Getting Started with Redis Enterprise and Docker on Mac OSx. Getting Started with Redis Enterprise and Docker on Linux. Deploying Redis Enterprise With Kubernetes on Google Cloud We will go through four steps to set up our cluster with Redis Enterprise. Step #1: Create a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud. Step #2: Deploy the Redis Enterprise containers to Kubernetes cluster. Step #3: Setup Redis Enterprise cluster. Step #4: Create a Redis database and test your connectivity. Note: The deployment is deliberately simplified and is great for getting started with Kubernetes and Redis Enterprise fast. It certainly isn’t intended for production use. Requirements The steps below were performed using the latest Google Cloud SDK and the kubectl tool on MacOS. There may be slight differences in detailed instructions with another operating system. Step #1: Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Cloud Let's first get your command line environment set up. First, authenticate to your Google Cloud environment. gcloud auth login Get the default project_ID set. Here is how you can list and set the project context to be used with the upcoming commands. Note that you will get some random name like mine (“speedy-lattice-166011”) if you have not explicitly specified an ID. gcloud projects list gcloud config set project speedy-lattice-166011 Finally, let’s get the default zone/geography where you want your cluster set up. Here is how you can list the zones and set the zone context to be used: gcloud compute zones list gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-c Let’s get the Kubernetes cluster up and running. On your Google Cloud console, click on “Container Engine” option on the left nav and create a new cluster. To define your Kubernetes cluster, give it a name and keep the size of the cluster to 3 nodes. we’ll use all 3 nodes to deploy the Redis Enterprise cluster. I recommend you keep the size of nodes as at least 2 cores and over 7GB RAM. Note: It may take a few minutes to create the cluster. Ensure the Kubernetes cluster creation is complete before proceeding to the next step. For best placement, Redis Enterprise pods should be placed on separate physical nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. This ensures better availability when facing node failures. Placing multiple Redis Enterprise nodes in the same physical host can cause multiple nodes to fail at once and may result in availability and data loss. To ensure we can guarantee better placement, we need to upgrade the Kubernetes cluster to 1.6.2 or better. You can do the upgrade in the details page of the Kubernetes cluster deployment we just created. Note: By the way, If you are a command line kind of person, here is how you can simplify the three screen above into 2 simple lines; gcloud container clusters create cluster-1 --num-nodes=3 -m n1-standard-2 gcloud container clusters upgrade cluster-1 --master --cluster-version=1.6.2 Finally, to finish the Kubernetes deployment, you need to get the Kubernetes console up and running and start the Kubernetes proxy. In the terminal window, run the following commands. Connect to the Kubernetes cluster: gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster-1 The output will read: # Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
# kubeconfig entry generated for cluster-1.  And finally, start the Kubernetes proxy: kubectl proxy Step #2: Deploy the Redis Enterprise containers to Kubernetes cluster You now need to feed the container YAML file to provision Redis Enterprise cluster. A sample YAML file can be found here. kubectl apply -f redis-enterprise.yaml If the deployment is successful, the output should look like this: # deployment "redispack-deployment" created 
# service "redispack" created You can now see the list of container nodes deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. Simply run the following to see the list of nodes: kubectl get po  The output will look something like this: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
redispack-deployment-709212938-765lg 1/1 Running 0 7s
redispack-deployment-709212938-k8njr 1/1 Running 0 7s
redispack-deployment-709212938-kcjd7 1/1 Running 0 7s Step #3: Set Up the Redis Enterprise Cluster We are now ready to create the Redis Enterprise cluster. There is one small change that needs to be made to the container to get networking to work properly: We need to change the CSS binding to 0.0.0.0. To do this, you need to run the following in each container with each iteration using the pod's name from the kubectl get po output above. kubectl exec -it redispack-deployment-709212938-765lg -- bash
 # sudo su -
 # sed ‘s/bind 127.0.0.1/bind 0.0.0.0/g’ -i /opt/redislabs/config/ccs-redis.conf
 # cnm_ctl restart With this, let’s provision the first node or the Redis Enterprise cluster. kubectl exec -it redispack-deployment-709212938-765lg "/opt/redislabs/bin/rladmin" cluster 
create name cluster.local username cihan@redislabs.com password redislabs123 flash_enabled We will need the IP address of the first node to be able to instruct the following nodes to join the cluster. kubectl exec -it redispack-deployment-709212938-765lg ifconfig | grep "inet addr" In my case, the output was 10.0.2.10. Let's add nodes 2 and 3 to the cluster: kubectl exec -it redispack-deployment-709212938-k8njr "/opt/redislabs/bin/rladmin" cluster join 
username cihan@redislabs.com password redislabs123 nodes 10.0.2.10 flash_enabled kubectl exec -it redispack-deployment-709212938-kcjd7 "/opt/redislabs/bin/rladmin" cluster join 
username cihan@redislabs.com password redislabs123 nodes 10.0.2.10 flash_enabled Step #4: Create a Redis Database and Test Your Connectivity We are now ready to create the database and connect to it. The following curl command can be used to create a database on port 12000. The database will be named “sample-db”. kubectl exec -it redispack-deployment-709212938-765lg bash
# curl -k -u "cihan@redislabs.com:redislabs123" --request POST --url "https://localhost:9443/v1/bdbs" --header 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"name":"sample-db","type":"redis","memory_size":1073741824,"port":12000}' To test the connection to the database, we will use the redis-cli tool. Here is a simple set followed by a get to validate the Redis deployment. kubectl exec -it redispack-deployment-709212938-765lg bash
# /opt/redislabs/bin/redis-cli -p 12000
# 127.0.0.1:12000> set a 1
# OK
# 127.0.0.1:12000> get a
# "1"
# 127.0.0.1:12000> Note: To clean up the deployment, you can simply delete the cluster using the following command line: gcloud container clusters delete cluster-1 Mesosphere DC/OS delivers AWS-like services and simplicity to your data center–on-premise or public cloud.

Effective immediately, Google has removed this restriction and is now allowing 300×250 sized ads to be placed above the fold. Google’s reasoning for this is because it believes 300×250 sized ads can be placed above the fold in a way that doesn’t hurt the user experience. ”After careful review, we’ve determined that when 300×250 ads are implemented above the fold in a user-friendly way, the ads do not annoy, distract, or result in ad performance issues.” The company reminds users, even though these ad types are now allowed above the fold, make sure the ads do not cause content to be pushed down the page. Not only does this hurt the user experience, but it could lead to accidental clicks from users trying to scroll through the page. ”To ensure a good user experience, we still recommend the site content should be clear and accessible above the fold.” Here’s an example of unacceptable use of these larger sized ads from Google’s AdSense ad placement policies: Google did not provide any examples of acceptable uses of the 300×250 ad unit above the fold, which is something I would be curious to see. Unless you’re using a large screen phone it’s tough to imagine those ad units getting in the way of the content. We’ll have to wait and see how site owners implement them.

Google bakes phishing protection into the Gmail for Android app Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 7:40pm PDTMay 3, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 62 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares147 Applications Google News Perhaps due to today's outbreak of a widespread phishing scam, or simply by coincidence, Google is rolling out enhanced anti-phishing security checks in Gmail for Android. When users tap on a suspicious link, the above warning will now appear. Judging by the page design, this feature appears to use Google's Safe Browsing database, which catalogs sites known to host malware or trick users into giving away information. Ironically, this wouldn't have done anything to prevent the recent phishing outbreak, as the link in that email redirected to a normal Google login page. The change appears to be part of Gmail for Android 7.4.23, which you can grab from APKMirror right now, or wait for the Play Store to roll out the update to you.

Fortune reports that on Wednesday, a lot of people received an email that came by way of subject “So-and-so has shared a document on Google Docs with you.” It might seem legit, but once you click on the link, it wreaks havoc on your account. Whether you recognize the sender’s name in question or not, it’s a phishing scam designed to infect your computer. What’s more, Twitter user Zach Latta posted a video of what clicking on the email link actually looks like, pointing out that it’s “super sophisticated.” In saying that, he means that, until the virus actually invades your computer, the software nearly identically mimics the way you would go about viewing an actual Google Doc. If you go through the motions of logging in, you will, in fact, be giving these hackers every single key to the ultimate castle: your Gmail. While not much has been explained about the origins of this current threat to your digital livelihood, Gmail did take to Twitter to make the following “Official Google Statement”. The company tweeted, “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs & have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.” If you’ve had the unfortunate luck of already clicking an email link that is beginning to sound a lot like this one, never fear: You can backtrack easily. Simply go to your Google account settings, here, and revoke access to the fake Google Docs app. While computer viruses are never fun to deal with, it’s certainly a reminder that — especially in a day and age where we are so reliant upon technology — we need to take a little bit of extra care before clicking on anything.

Beijing Youth Daily comments: The case shows we still lack effective global internet governance. Since there are no governance regulations that suit all countries and regions, it is time each country drafted one of its own. Actually, the fraudster in the Google and Facebook case cheated in a way that is quite common in China: He pretended to be a customer of the two companies and sent emails asking for money. In China that happens every day and the authorities have done very well in educating people not to fall into such traps. The Chinese authorities are also doing well in combating online fraud and regulating the internet. According to 110.360.cn, an official platform for reporting internet scams, they received 20,623 such reports in 2016, with the total money involved reaching 195 million yuan (.3 million). Some experts have even estimated that the losses to internet fraud may exceed 100 billion yuan a year. China has been constantly fighting the fraudsters who hide in the vast expanse of the internet. The country has already established a nationwide big data anti-fraud platform, and it is building a long-term regulation mechanism for the internet. But improved legislation is needed to protect personal information in order to effectively fight fraudsters. The internet must be under the rule of law and only proper regulation can protect people's legal rights and allow the virtual economy to prosper. The case of Google and Facebook shows that creativity alone is not enough, what is needed is stricter regulation.

By: Shilpa Published: Thursday, May 4, 2017, 9:06 [IST] If you are a regular user of Google Docs, then be aware! Do not open any invites from others to edit a file, it may be a spam to make you as a victim of phishing scheme. The attacker made use of a different way to phish this time. Without even gaining an access your account with a password, the phishers could harm your data. They did so by taking the advantage of the fact that one can create a web app similar to Google page but with a misleading name. That is, asking a logged-in user to grant permission to a malicious app developed by them. According to Reddit, here is how the attack took place. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Email invitation Firstly an email invitation will be sent to a victim from the person they may know. This invitation requests you to open the file in Google Docs. Lets you select among few account Once you open the invitation, it lets you select among few already logged in Google account. After you select the required account, the attack begins. Also Read: 11 Google Docs features that you probably didn't know Asks permission to grant the access Once done with selecting the account, it takes them to a Google sign-in page and asks them to continue with Google Docs. This helps the attacker to get the access to your mail and address book. Because when you continue with docs, it is not an original page instead a third party malicious app which is named as ‘Google Docs'. Developer information title You can verify it by checking the title for developer information. It will look something like the above picture. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Also Read: How to use Google Map to find your parked car Regarding this, Google says, "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." Google took this issue seriously and disabled the application to fix it. Later it confirmed telling that the issue has been resolved. Update: Google revoked the app, there's nothing more to do. Attacker likely has victim info on their servers, but no more account control.— Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Source Samsung Galaxy S8 57,900 Specs Competitors Images +39 Read More About google | google docs | apps | news Other articles published on May 4, 2017 Please Wait while comments are loading...

Beware of emails any from one of your acquaintances asking you to click on the link to read a Google Doc. Possibly millions are receiving them as part of a new scam to collect personal information. If you do click on the link, it will take you to a screen listing all your Google accounts, and the link to go to Google Docs. When you click again it will give a third party access to your Google email and address books. Google issued the following statement: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.

The Google Assistant SDK is now publicly available, allows developers to port Assistant to new devices Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:26am PDTApr 27, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares146 Development Google News Videos One of the reasons Amazon's Alexa assistant has become so popular is because it can be integrated into nearly everything. We've seen phones, speakers, and even refrigerators with Alexa. Now Google is opening up Google Assistant to the same level of accessibility, with the new Google Assistant SDK. With the SDK, developers can integrate Assistant into existing products fairly easily. It remains to be seen how much functionality will be available to third-party devices running Assistant, as it is already fragmented on Google's own devices. But the focus seems to be primarily on voice, not visual displays like Assistant on Android. To make developing easier, the SDK includes the gRPC API, a Python client that handles user authentication and access to the API. This is especially useful if you are trying out the SDK on a Raspberry Pi or similar development board. This first version of the SDK is a Developer Preview, with several features still in development - including hotword support and companion app integration. Google has created a G+ community, a Stack Overflow tag, and a mailing list to help out developers using the SDK. I'm definitely going to try it out myself.

Randroid Looks like I need another Raspberry Pi... Corbin Davenport I haven't actually dug into the SDK yet, but if you don't care about connecting other hardware to Assistant (using the Pi's data pins, for example), I don't see why the Python library wouldn't work on any computer with Python installed. Randroid I'm willing to spend some time tinkering with things. I might put it on the same Pi as my Plex server... maybe I can play things directly from my Plex server using just my voice :-) Eric Abreu It looks like it's actually compatible with several other platforms and languages: https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-other-platforms/ CD RW I need a Pi to build my own Google Home surethom Let's hope developers are better than Google, google cannot even get google home to add calendar entry's or even the basic like play my uploaded music by artist or song title . pfmiller Google Assistant is Google Assistant. This only allows you to access it from 3rd party devices, it's functionality is still in Google's hands. Wikiwix Who builds a Windows Client? abc Most of the world? Eric Siedlecki Does this mean manufacturers will now be able to add Assistant to their devices, therefore creating actual Google Home rivals? That'll be awesome. It could push innovation and lower prices. Yay! TheScientists Yes, that's exactly what it means. Google wants Assistant everywhere, just like Amazon wants Alexa everywhere. They don't care which device is getting the sale. Random! What's the minimum required hardware for Assistant? myssi Raspberry Pi 3 Random! ...which instantaneously adds $40+ to the BOM of any projects which didn't already contain a Raspi. Damn. I found a list where they say it should work in anything able to run Linux, Windows or MAC OS. I wish they would have been more specific about the required processing power. JG Wouldn't mind seeing a Windows based Google Assistant. Replace Cortana. Too bad, though, it appears your stuck using the "OK Google" trigger phrase. Being able to replace it with "OK Computer" would be great in this instance. Avi Faitelewicz See above: "hotword support". JG Hotword support, for the standard "ok Google" trigger. Not custom triggers. Watch the embedded video. He specifically mentioned OK Google or use of a hardware button. No mention of custom trigger phrases. Maxr1998 You could possibly create your own hotword solution to launch Assistant, though of course that's a lot more complicated. myssi hotword support https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cc9e79ed8ff9801b52ea180b2655fa8ba9654b3fa9580faae85323dcecae5328.jpg bozzykid I don't think hotword support means what you think it does.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube The best new Android feature might finally launch soon Chris Smith @chris_writes May 3rd, 2017 at 11:04 PM Share Tweet When Google demoed Android Nougat for the first time almost a year ago at Google I/O 2016, Instant Apps was one of the features that stood out, as a trick the iPhone didn’t have at the time and still doesn’t have now. But as hot as it may be, the feature wasn’t ready for public consumption when Google released the final Nougat build last year. However, things might change soon, as Google is apparently getting ready to enable it on devices running Android 7 as well as phones and tablets running older Android versions. Don't Miss: No iPhone user can even imagine dealing with what Android users have to tolerate Instant Apps will let users enjoy instant app experiences on their smartphones without actually downloading a particular app for. Assuming it works as described, the feature will solve a bunch of problems. First of all, it’ll help save storage on the phone, as you won’t have to keep an app installed just because you might have to use it every now and then. Secondly, you won’t have to buy an app to try it since developers will be able to offer a portion of an app to test for free. Finally, the Instant Apps features will work on most Android devices out there, not just Nougat-based ones, as it’s built on Google Play Services. Looking at the code in the latest version of Google Play Store, 9to5Google discovered that Google might be getting ready to roll out Instant Apps. The code reveals that users will be able to enable or disable the feature and choose which Google account to use with an app. Here’s Google’s demo of Instant Apps: 9to5Google also mentions several new features in the Google Play Store 7.8 update, including a Google Play app discovery service, a pre-registration rewards features for apps, and a new security branding for Verify Apps — that’s Play Protect.

Google said it was investigating an email scam winding its way through inboxes across the country and had disabled the accounts responsible for the spam. The scheme emerged this afternoon, when spammers dispatched malicious email, appearing to come from people the recipients knew, beckoning them to click on what appeared to be a shared Google document. Recipients who clicked on the links were prompted to give the sender access to their Google contact lists and Google Drive. In the process, victims allowed spammers to raid their contact lists and send even more email. “We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs,” Google said statement posted on Twitter. “We encourage you to not click through and report as phishing within Gmail.” It is not clear who created the spam email or how many people it has affected. In a second statement, this evening, Google said that it had disabled the accounts responsible for the spam, updated its systems to block it and was working on ways to prevent such an attack from recurring. If you receive suspicious email, here are some tips: 1. Do not click, even when the email is from your mother. Even when you receive links from trusted contacts, be careful what you click. Spammers, cybercriminals and, increasingly, nation-state spies are resorting to basic email attacks, known as spear phishing, which bait victims into clicking on links that download malicious software, or lure them into turning over their user names and passwords. A quarter of phishing attacks studied last year by Verizon were found to be nation-state spies trying to gain entry into their target’s inboxes, up from the 9 percent of attacks reported in 2016. In this case, the malicious emails all appeared to come from a contact, but were actually from the address “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com” with recipients BCCed. 2. Turn on multifactor authentication. Google and most other email, social media and banking services offer customers the ability to turn on multifactor authentication. Use it. When you log in from an unrecognized computer, the service will prompt you to enter a one-time code texted to your phone. It is the most basic way to prevent hackers from breaking into your accounts with a stolen password. 3. Shut it down. If you accidentally clicked on the Google phishing attack and gave spammers third-party access to your Google account, you can revoke their access by following these steps: Go to https://myaccount.google.com/permissions. Revoke access to “Google Docs” (the app will have access to contacts and drive). 4. Change your passwords … again. If you’ve been phished, change your passwords to something you have never used before. Ideally, your passwords should be long and should not be words that could be found in a dictionary. The first things hackers do when breaking into a site is use computer programs that will try every word in the dictionary. Your email account is a ripe target for hackers because your inbox is the key to resetting the passwords of, and potentially breaking into, dozens of other accounts. Make your password long and distinctive. Security specialists advise creating anagrams based on song lyrics, movie quotations or sayings. For example, “The Godfather” movie quotation “Leave the gun. Take the cannoli,” becomes LtG,tTcannol1. 5. Report it. Report any phishing attacks to Google by clicking the downward arrow at the top right of your inbox and selecting “Report Phishing.” Companies count on those reports to investigate such scams and stop them.

The scam claimed to come from Google Docs - a service that allows people to share and edit documents online. Users who clicked a link and followed instructions, risked sending the email on to everyone in their address box. Google said it had stopped the attack "within approximately one hour", including through "removing fake pages and applications". "While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed," Google said in an updated statement. "There's no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup." Google said the spam campaign affected "fewer than 0.1%" of Gmail users. That works out to about one million people affected. Phishing is an attempt to trick people into handing over their personal information by posing as a reputable company.

An email phishing scam is quickly spreading to many Gmail users.More Journalists, educators and employees of major corporations appear to be the target of a widespread Google Doc phishing scam that attempts to hijack a user’s email account by tricking them into clicking on a fake Google Doc file. Reports of the malware first started surfacing on Twitter, when users noted they received an email that appeared to be from a person they know attempting to share a Google Doc file. The Google Doc phishing attack spoofs official domain names and presents itself like a typical Google Doc email. Read: What Is Phishing? Hackers Use Email Vulnerabilities To Infiltrate Data And Steal Identities, And Even Obama Is At Risk When a user clicks on the link to access the document, it will attempt to gain access to their account. The relatively sophisticated attack is actually from a third-party app not developed by Google but named Google Docs. The app asks for access to the user’s account—including reading, sending, deleting and managing emails and full access to a user’s contacts. If granted access, the attack will then send similar emails to a user’s contacts in hopes of tricking them into making the same mistake. Because the attack gains access to a user’s account through official means—though by misrepresenting itself—it can bypass typical security measure likes two-factor authorization and login alters. Users are advised not to click on the link in the email in order to bypass the attack entirely. However, those who have clicked on the link can avoid being hit by the attack by not granting the fake Google Docs app permission to access their account. Read: Phishing Scams: How To Identify Fraudulent Emails That Want To Steal Your Money, Identity Google has reportedly already put a stop to the attack, according to a Reddit post made by a user claiming to work at Google.   "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," a spokesperson for Google told International Business Times. "We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." For those who were hit, there is still a way to remove the app and prevent it from doing any damage or spreading itself further. How To Remove Account Access From The Fake Google Docs For those who clicked on the fake Google Docs link in the phishing emails, the app can be removed by going to the Google accounts page and viewing the permissions granted to apps on that account. Locate the “Google Docs” app. It should show a recent Authorization Time, as it is an app that likely just recently was granted permission to the account. Click on Google Docs and click the “Remove” button. This will revoke access and stop the app from using your account to continue spreading the attack. It’s also a good idea to take the opportunity of removing the fake Google Docs to go through the apps that have been granted permission to access your account and make sure they are all services you trust and need. The attack is a friendly reminder that your information is more widely accessible than you may realize, and an attack on any of those individual apps may compromise you.

The sophisticated attack appeared to come from a trusted source asking you to open a Google Document. If you clicked, it took you to a page to open the “Google Docs” app with your Google account. This granted access to your email account and contacts. Google said it stopped the attacks in one hour. Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says anyone who clicked on the link should check their Google App permissions and remove the one called “Google Docs.” You can do that by clicking this link. It’s unclear how widespread the attack was, but reporters at publications including BuzzFeed, CNN and Motherboard tweeted that they’d receiving the phishing email, as had many of their sources. According to threat intelligence firm Talos, at its peak, around 150 messages were being sent per minute. On Wednesday afternoon, “Google Docs” was a global trending topic on Twitter, meaning a lot of people were talking about the attacks. In a statement to CNNTech, a Google spokesperson said the attack affected fewer than 0.1% of Gmail users. (Gmail has over one billion monthly active users, and 0.1% of that total would be at least one million accounts.) Google said contact information was accessed and used in the attack, but no other information was exposed. “We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions, including removing the fake pages and applications, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, and other anti-abuse systems,” the company said in a statement. It’s not clear who was behind the phishing attempts. This attack spread quickly — the fake Google Docs app read users’ contacts and sent more phishing attempts to their contacts. A phishing attack is a popular method of stealing credentials and hacking into people’s emails, bank accounts or other private accounts. A hacker poses as a trusted source and sends you a malicious link. Experts say the phish was convincing and sophisticated. Here’s what happened: Hackers created a malicious app and named it “Google Docs,” which looked trustworthy. Google uses an authorization system called OAuth, which uses security tokens instead of passwords to connect your Google account with third party apps. Because the malicious app looked legit, it essentially tricked users into trusting it with their security token — which is all that was needed to access the accounts. This is a popular phishing method — security firm Trend Micro reported earlier this year that Russian hackers were using it. “As we have seen repeatedly, these kinds of schemes are usually the precursor to larger nefarious activities, like money transfers, planting ransomware, etc.,” said Frances Zelazny, VP of cybersecurity startup BioCatch.

Now, it seems like Microsoft is about to challenge the market that Google once had with the Surface Laptop. When one hears of Chromebooks, the next thing that comes to mind is its cost. Many would know by now that for a struggling student, the Chromebook is the most viable option for a laptop for school use. But now that Microsoft has entered the fray, students will now be able to make a choice on which system to get. But perhaps the main question is, “which one is better?” Cost In terms of cost, Google Chromebooks do come cheap. Some manufacturers even go as low as $199 for a brand new unit. Of course, with that price, one cannot expect a top-notch performance. However, there are some Chromebooks out there that has far superior hardware capabilities but still keep the cost under $500. On the other hand, the Surface Laptop starts at $999. For anyone looking for more “oomph factor,” the specs can be boosted for a few hundred dollars more. Operating system Anyone who has been using a computer for a long time will know that switching operating systems can sometimes be a pain. There is the uncomfortable adjustment period that one has trying to re-learn the nooks and crannies of a new operating system. This is why when choosing a device, it is one of the first considerations that one includes in the list. Microsoft Surface Laptop (via microsoftstore.com) The Surface Laptop and the Chromebook have something in common, they both use a lightweight operating system. These operating systems, while behaving in the completely opposite sides of the spectrum, do share one commonality: they are both tied to an app store. The Windows 10 S is reliant on the Windows Store for all the apps that can be run on the Surface Laptop. If an app is not available in the Windows Store, there is no chance at all to run the application in question without upgrading to a Windows 10 Pro. Meanwhile, the same thing applies for the Chromebook. However, the only good thing about the Chromebook, is that it can also run Android apps that normally run on a mobile phone. Performance When it comes to performance, the Surface Laptop is here to represent. This is due to the fact that the base specs start with an Intel i5 processor with 4GB of RAM and 128 of flash storage. Meanwhile, a Chromebook normally comes with an M series Intel processor with the same amount of RAM and storage. However, there are some Chromebooks that sport an Intel i5 chip like the Acer Chromebook 15 but still keep the cost to well under $500. Acre Chromebook 15 (via acer.com) As mentioned, the Surface Laptop price starts at $999. The top-tier version of the laptop can set anyone back $2,699. But it should be noted that this configuration includes an Intel i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of flash storage. When it comes to choosing between a Chromebook and the Surface Laptop, the first thing to be considered is the budget. If one wants a cheap and cheerful system, then the Google Chromebook is the obvious choice. However, for top-draw performance, the Surface Laptop is the best option.

KAZINFORM - Google has said it has taken action against a phishing email that targeted users of its online documents service. The company said it had "disabled offending accounts" and "removed fake pages" after users raised concerns they might have been hacked, BBC News reports. The email claimed to be from Google Docs, a service that allows people to share and edit documents online. Google urged users not to click a link in the email and to report it through Google's email service Gmail. It was not immediately clear how many people had been affected. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," Google said in a statement. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again."

Facebook app on smartphone (File picture). Source: istock.com Yesterday the Commerce Commission rejected a proposal for Fairfax New Zealand and NZME to merge, saying it could cause "harm to democracy". But both companies say they're struggling because companies are increasingly wanting to advertise online and Google and Facebook suck up 80 per cent of online advertising revenue in New Zealand. Revenue Minister Judith Collins says New Zealand, like many other countries, is smaller than some of the multinationals who earn money here. She says while most comply with the letter of the law, "they're certainly not contributing in the way we'd expect them to". Ms Collins says the Government is working towards a multilateral agreement with other countries to address this, which should be in place in about six months. "New Zealanders want to see everyone paying their fair share of tax and as I like to say to some of the multinationals that I get to deal with, 'just because we're friendly doesn't mean to say we're stupid,'" Ms Collins says. It's a move that has gone down well with the unions, which say this should help create a more level playing field. E Tu Union organiser Paul Tolich says Facebook and Google "take the lions share of the advertising but provide no resources to do any news gathering".

The robots are winning: Google's neural network OCR gives names to the nameless (streets) Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 5:35pm PDTMay 3, 2017 6 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares76 Google News Everyone uses Google Maps, but not often do we consider where, exactly, all that data comes from. When a new road goes in, or a bypass, or the name of a street changes, it isn't as if your local city reaches out to Google to make sure everything is up to date. Some of that used to come from user submissions in the Map Maker forum. Now those tools are being rolled into Maps itself, but that's not the only source of information. Google's fleets of Street View cars collect an insane number of images, and nestled in with them are pictures of businesses, street signs, and addresses, and Google's latest research blog post goes into some interesting details about all that potential data. Those signs might be recognizable as text to you and me, but they obviously aren't text to a computer. And, it wouldn't be cost-effective to have an army of people pouring over all those images just to enter them in plain text. That's where machine learning and neural networks start to come in handy (warning, wiki-hole). Really, though, a neural network is just a way of processing data via training, rather than by direct instruction. Instead of explicitly programming a system to do something, you put a system together that can be told when its results for a given input are right or wrong, and which then adapts weighted triggers in a hidden processing layer until the output is correct. Basically, you show it things and tell it what it should see, until it does. As an aside, you can actually make your own neural network at home pretty easily and do all sorts of fun stuff. In my college computational systems course I only ever used one to make an interpreter for portrait images to determine the sex of a person pictured, and even then I think I never got things above 65% accuracy. My point is, they're easier to understand than their complex name might imply.   Google is making use of these types of deep neural networks to read street names from images collected via Street View. It's basically just a method for OCR, and it has gotten very good, over 85% accuracy reading French street names. It knows which text in an image is important to a business name, street name, or address, and what isn't and can be safely ignored. It doesn't even get thrown off (too badly) by differences in formatting or font. Google's OCR tools have seen changes to over 30% of all addresses in Maps. In some locations, its use has resulted in over a 90% improvement. And, benevolently, Google has also been good about releasing their tools and models over the years for others to use. They did exactly that with their latest bit of OCR magic. Humorously, half of Google's mistakes from one particular model came down to so-called "ground truth" errors, which is a fancy way of saying the system was right, but the data provided was wrong. If you're even mildly interested in any of this, I really encourage you to check out the post on Google's research blog. It's super cool stuff.

It's called the Crowdsource app. Even if we are training the AI, Google doesn't get to say they just built an AI and its amazing. Carson Saldanha I think the Crowdsource app is more just to "verify" the information. Plus, there isn't that many people actively using it, and those that do are just Google fans. So naturally, all their data can't come from there. AQ Before the crowdsource app was the crowdsource website, each with their own contribution score. I've contributed hundreds on each & can assure you that the neural network misses allot. Also don't underestimate a multi billion dollar companies ability to find dirt cheap labor in other countries. ryraansh They also use these images in ReCaptcha Ryne Hager Indeed, some of the OCR information is probably verified through Crowdsource, or training for the apps set-up with known sets generated that way. Nonetheless, their neural nets are pretty cool, and they probably handle a whole lot more data than the people on Crowdsource do. Romario Maxwell As in.

Facebook thinks it can handle it for you OAuth 2.0 Security Used by Facebook, Others Called Weak Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key Google Docs was pulled into a sneaky email phishing attack on Tuesday that was designed to trick users into giving up access to their Gmail accounts. The phishing emails, which circulated for about three hours before Google stopped them, invited the recipient to open what appeared to be a Google Doc. The teaser was a blue box that said, “Open in Docs.” In reality, the link led to a dummy app that asked users for permission to access their Gmail account. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] Reddit An example of the phishing email that circulated on Tuesday. Users might easily have been fooled, because the dummy app was actually named “Google Docs.” It also asked for access to Gmail through Google’s actual login service. The hackers were able to pull off the attack by abusing the OAuth protocol, a way for internet accounts at Google, Twitter, Facebook and other services to connect with third-party apps.   The OAuth protocol doesn’t transfer any password information, but instead uses special access tokens that can open account access. However, OAuth can be dangerous in the wrong hands. The hackers behind Tuesday’s attack appear to have built an actual third-party app that leveraged Google processes to gain account access. Reddit The dummy app will try to ask for account permission.  “The attack is quite clever and it exploits the ability for you to link your Google Account to a third-party application,” said Mark Nunnikhoven, vice president of cloud research at security firm Trend Micro. Exploiting OAuth for account access is particularly devious because it can bypass the need to steal someone’s login credentials or even Google’s 2-step verification. Last month, Trend Micro said a Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear was using a similar email attack method that abused the OAuth protocol to phish victims. However, security experts said Tuesday’s phishing attack probably wasn’t from Fancy Bear, a shadowy group that many experts suspect works for the Russian government. “I don’t believe they are behind this ... because this is way too widespread,” Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at security provider AlienVault, said in an email.  On Tuesday, many users on Twitter, including journalists, posted screen shots of the phishing emails, prompting speculation that the hackers were harvesting victims’ contact lists to target more users. The attack was also sent through an email address at “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com.” Mailinator, a provider of a free email service, denied any involvement.  Fortunately, Google moved quickly to stop the phishing attacks, after a user on Reddit posted about them. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again,” Google said in a statement. Security experts and Google recommend affected users check what third-party apps have permission to access their account and revoke any suspicious access. Users can do so by visiting this address, or performing a Google security check-up. It’s also good practice to be careful around suspicious-looking emails. Many hacking attempts, including malware infections, come through links or attachments sent over email. Security firms are warning that other hackers may conduct similar phishing attacks abusing OAuth, not just through Google, but with Facebook and LinkedIn.  “Like all other creative, novel approaches, it will likely be heavily copied almost immediately,” Cisco’s Talos security group said in a blog post. Talos has identified more than 275,000 applications that use OAuth and connect to the cloud.  But even though Tuesday’s attack may have been novel, the dangers with OAuth are hardly new. Security experts have warned in the past that users may be phished through manipulation of OAuth to grant permissions to the wrong party. In response to such attacks, Google said last month that it reviews any OAuth abuse and takes down thousands of apps that violate its user data policy, including those that impersonate company products. Tuesday’s phishing scheme will probably push Google to adopt an even stricter stance on apps that use OAuth, said Robert Graham, CEO of research company Errata Security. However, the internet giant has to strike a balance between ensuring security and fostering a flourishing app ecosystem.  “The more vetting you do, the more you stop innovation,” Graham said. “It’s a trade-off.” To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

While Google has already said that they are working on fixing the issue, here is what you can do to make sure you are safe. tech Updated: May 04, 2017 10:13 IST HT Correspondent Hindustan Times Google said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages.(Google) Spammers are on the rise again and this time their victim list includes almost all Gmail/Google users. Alphabet Inc warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs after a large number of people turned to social media to complain that their accounts had been hacked. Google said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX— Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 However, here are a few steps that may help you make sure that you are safe or at least you have raised an alarm: A) Just delete it, your mom is unlikely to send you a Google Docs link Spammers resolve to basic of the attacks and in this case the method can be termed as phishing. The method includes sending an email that lures victims into clicking on links that download malicious software, or lure them into turning over their user names and passwords. In this case, the malicious emails all appeared to come from a contact, but were actually from the address “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com” with recipients BCCed. B) Whatever you do, multifactor authentication is your best, last defence Google and most other email, social media and banking services offer customers the ability to turn on multifactor authentication. Use it. When you log in from an unrecognised computer, the service will prompt you to enter a one-time code texted to your phone. It is the most basic way to prevent hackers from breaking into your accounts with a stolen password. C) Get them off! If you accidentally clicked on the Google phishing attack and gave spammers third-party access to your Google account, you can revoke their access by following these steps: Go to https://myaccount.google.com/permissions Revoke access to “Google Docs” (the app will have access to contacts and drive). D) Yes! Change your passwords one more time If you’ve been phished, change your passwords to something you have never used before. Ideally, your passwords should be long and should not be words that could be found in a dictionary. The first things hackers do when breaking into a site is use computer programs that will try every word in the dictionary. Longer and distinctive passwords are the best \. Security specialists advise creating anagrams based on song lyrics, movie quotations or sayings. For example, “The Godfather” movie quotation “Leave the gun. Take the cannoli,” becomes LtG,tTcannol1. E) Raise the alarm or send an SOS Most importantly, you need to report any phishing attack. Just click the downward arrow at the top right of your inbox and report the attack by selecting “Report Phishing.” Companies count on those reports to probe such scams and stop them. tags Google Docs scam Google Docs spam attack Goole news Google spam attack protection Google spam attack troubleshooting more from tech Apple iPhone 8 could come with MacBook Pro-like Touchbar called function area: Report May 04, 2017 09:22 IST Google Docs scam: Users spammed with malicious emails May 04, 2017 08:07 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

Google releases official statement on widespread Google Docs phishing email Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 3:05pm PDTMay 3, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 89 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Google News Phishing emails are annoying and potentially dangerous, but very rarely do we see one as nefarious as this. A specific email, shown above, has been making waves in the news and Google has released an official statement regarding it. First, you may be wondering why this specific message is worth talking about. First, it looks identical to normal Google Docs invitation emails. When the 'Open in Docs' link is clicked, the user is asked to give "Google Docs" access to their Google account. Essentially, someone made a web app that identifies itself as Google Docs, easily tricking anyone not paying close attention. @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Not too long ago, the official Twitter account for Gmail sent the below tweet: We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail. — Gmail (@gmail) May 3, 2017 Shortly afterwards, the Google Docs account tweeted an official statement from the company: (1 of 3) Official Google Statement on Phishing Email: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs... — Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 (2 of 3) & have disabled offending accounts.

True story. creep_the_night The Android version doesn't get quite that hot, but it does heat up pretty well.

The fraudulent invitations spread like wildfire before they were finally stopped, but many questions remain. On Wednesday, several Gmail users received emails from known contacts, asking them to click on a link to Google Docs. Even diligent and cautious users fell for this new phishing scam, causing it to rapidly circulate far and wide. Phishing scams usually involve fraudulent emails from cyber-criminals pretending to be someone else to steal money, valuable information, or even a person’s identity. Once the user clicked the link, accepting an invitation to Google Docs, they were brought to a seemingly legitimate Google page. However, the app was not the real Google Docs, but a fake application with the same name. Emails for sale: Dark web vendor peddles decrypted #Gmail, #Yahoo accounts https://t.co/PTmXEghfTv— RT America (@RT_America) March 7, 2017 Apparently, hackers registered an app with Google under the name “Google Docs,” then made a very similar looking landing page. Users on social media pointed out that the app was not registered to Google under the developer information, but to eugene.pupov@gmail.com.  The novel aspect of this phishing scam was that users were not asked to enter any of their information, they only had to click on a few spoofed links to give the app permission to "view and manage your e-mail" and "view and manage the files in your Google Drive." @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX— Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 "This is the future of phishing," Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc, told Reuters. "It gets attackers to their goal... without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device." Once the user clicked through all the links, hackers would be able to read their emails and forward the same phishing attack to anyone they had ever emailed.   40% of Americans are more cautious about emails after alleged DNC hack – poll https://t.co/VwnfwOVPEF— RT America (@RT_America) April 6, 2017 Anyone who granted access to the app also gave hackers the access to their Google account data, which could be used to access bank accounts or other sensitive information. "This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party," Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, told Reuters. On Wednesday, Google said it had “addressed the issue” after disabling the accounts, removing the fake pages and pushing updates through Safe Browsing. The company said they were “working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again," according to an official statement posted to Twitter.

Users who are afraid they fell victim to the scam can check their account by visiting the “connected apps and sites” page on their Google account. There, they can remove the app. To avoid phishing emails, Google advises users not to provide information to any emails you do not know are legitimate. Google states that they will “never send unsolicited messages asking for your password or other personal information.”  Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

The purpose of the scam, and the culprits behind it, remained unknown late in the day. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” a Google spokesperson said in an email response to an AFP inquiry. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” The scam combined “a phishing attack and a worm,” using a deceptive email to get people to open the door to malicious code that wriggled into their messaging programs to spread itself to others, according to Electronic Frontier Foundation staff technologist Cooper Quintin. Email sent from a known contact’s real address would arrive containing a link it claimed led to a file to be shared at Google Docs online service, according to a rundown of the chicanery. Clicking the link led to a real Google web address and asked for authorization to run an application the attacker had cleverly called ‘Google Docs.’ Permissions granted to the application included allowing it to read or send email on a person’s behalf. “It doesn’t immediately look like a phishing email,” Quintin said. “When you authorise the app, the very next thing it does is send the same emails to everyone in your contacts.” The application, along with online domains it was connecting to, were disabled within hours of it starting to spread wildly, according to Quintin. “I suspect that it was far more successful than whoever released it into the world hoped or expected, and was maybe undone by its own success,” he said. “The domains went down pretty quickly. Google disabled the app, so it is no longer a threat.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week WhatsApp back online after global outage of ‘a few hours’ Google Docs phishing scam doused after catching fire Apple Store along Singapore’s Orchard Road to open soon Facebook adding 3,000 people to screen out violent content (VIDEO) WhatsApp faces worldwide outage, says is fixing it Cyberattacks involving extortion are on the up, says Verizon What to expect from Microsoft’s May 2 event Taking steps to avoid phishing scams Hackers exploited Word flaw for months while Microsoft investigated Microsoft's silver lining: Surface loses, but Windows wins Most Watched Now Week Epic ‘Dark Tower’ trailer unleashed Netflix unveils official trailer for ‘The Defenders’ Things get gory in new TV spot for ‘Alien: Covenant’ Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles Google says will fight Australian tax office’s demand to pay more Hundreds displaced as Bahamas luxury festival implodes Google loses top hardware executive it poached from Amazon Google tweak aims to curb fake, misleading search results Google to open up Android to rivals in out-of-court deal with Russia Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google Docs phishing scam spreads widely, reportedly shut down quickly By Ethan Baron / May 3, 2017 at 6:40 PM With companies across the U.S. hardening their cybersecurity defenses, scammers are attacking the most vulnerable points: employees. That phenomenon was showcased May 3 in a widespread phishing attack that saw Google users hit with fake prompts to open a Google Docs document purportedly shared by someone they knew. “The attack was simple, but sinister,” TechCrunch reported. “Click the button to open the document, and you’d see a seemingly innocent page — one hosted by Google, no less! “It wouldn’t ask you for a password, and it already listed all of your accounts. The page was asking you to give a “Google Docs” app permission to read your email and contacts.” But the app was the work of an imposter — although that wasn’t obvious. “Even if you were generally dubious of these sorts of things, it checked a lot of the right boxes,” according to TechCrunch. Here’s what the scam was after: “The process provides the user’s credentials to the attacker, allowing them access to email accounts, social networks like Facebook or other platforms,” USA Today reported. That access can give attackers data for stealing identities, then plundering bank accounts or committing other financial crimes. “It’s unclear exactly how the attack works at the moment, but it does appear to be highly sophisticated,” tech website Motherboard reported while the attack was underway. A number of news media outlets reported their employees were targeted. “The scope of the attack is not limited to news organizations, but appears to be spreading on a massive scale through people’s contacts,” according to The Atlantic online magazine. Companies’ confidential information and assets can be vulnerable to phishing attacks, noted Dan Lohrmann, chief security officer at security-awareness training firm Security Mentor. “The litany of major data breach stories that began with the use of phishing attacks is growing by the month,” Lohrmann said in a statement. Google, through its Google Docs feed on Twitter, said just after 3 p.m. May 3 that it had “taken action,” removing “offending accounts” and “fake pages,” and was “working to prevent this type of spoofing from happening again.” The company had tweeted around 1:30 p.m. that it was investigating the phishing scam. In a statement issued around 7 p.m., Google said it had stopped the attack within about an hour, and that it had affected fewer than one in 1,000 Gmail users. “While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed,” Google said. “There’s no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup.” This type of attack is on the rise, said Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at San Francisco security consultancy AsTech. “As technical controls within many organizations have gotten stronger and automatically respond more quickly to detected threats, hackers are using attacks such as ransomware and honed spearphishing campaigns to go after the weakest link: people,” Wenzler said in a statement. “This particular phishing attack is especially nefarious, since it leverages some legitimate functionality within Google’s infrastructure.” Google took blame in various degrees from a number of different directions. “Google seems to be letting these through their normal spam filter and they are bypassing many protections, ending up in the primary mailboxes,” Lohrmann said while the attack was occurring. Tech website The Verge charged that the “attackers took advantage of a weakness, that may or may not have existed for some time, in Google’s system that allowed developers to create a non-Google web app with the ‘Google Docs’ name.” Google did not immediately respond to a request to comment on how it stopped the attack and whether it was to blame for any security holes or lapses.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 368 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares571 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera. I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 73 Plus 1 on G+ 212 Share on Facebook 117 Share on Twitter Total Shares402 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

Google.com.au was number 1 on the list, and the US Google was number 3. (Credit: ABC)  What sites do you visit regularly? A new list shows Australians are keen for a bargain, have an unsurprising interest in real estate, and mainly find their news on social media. Web analytics company Alexa, part of Amazon, released a list of the top 50 websites Australians are visiting. Google's Australian website came in at number one, followed by YouTube, Google's US site, Facebook and then social news website Reddit. Ebay came in at number seven, and Gumtree at 14. Streaming movies and television proved popular, with Netflix at number 13. "It tells us Australians pretty much live by [these] basic needs and drives — we like to shop, [and] we're concerned about our money," social psychologist Helen Street said. Dr Street said realestate.com.au was in the top 30, an indication that the everyday Australian had the cost of housing on their mind. "A lot of people are constantly looking at houses, maybe comparing the price of their own houses — or maybe that's coupled with discontent, this sort of need," she said. Dr Street said the list proved that Australians were no longer getting their information through "the grapevine", such as friends and neighbours. "Whether it's what restaurant to eat in, or who starred in the latest movie, or whatever it might be — Google is where we go," she said. But she said that might not always a good thing. "There is this pressure all the time to have a cheerful front on Facebook, smiling faces and photos and recording good things that happen," Dr Street said. "And I think that is what makes Facebook a very different machine, to simply finding out through the neighbours or chatting about what's going on socially. "It's replacing those everyday encounters." Australians 'want shorter, not longer' Social researcher Mark McCrindle said the appearance of YouTube at number two, far above Wikipedia at number six, was striking. "People are increasingly time-poor and how they consume that content has changed," he said. "Particularly in an online environment, to sit and read and to think, that's generally not the forms that work these days and it's not the content." And YouTube, he said, met the need of today's generation. "Particularly when there's information overload," he said. "Businesses and all communication creators are working out they can't just add more content, more words, it's about shorter not longer. "One of those top sites on the list — it just tipped out of number 10 to number 11 — is Twitter [where posts are written] in 140 characters. "Facebook as well, it's about the visual, not just the written form." Direct sources of news only just made the top 20 — news.com.au was number 18, and the ABC was number 19. But Professor McCrindle said it was not a sign that the media was dead, yet. "These days a lot of that news is being gained through social media sites," he said. "So if we look at what we're consuming, through a Twitter link, or what we're looking at even on a Facebook page, it often does link back to a news page. "It just shows that Australians have moved into a peer-generated consumption form, rather than going to expert channels alone." Porn ranks high Porn was also a strong performer, at numbers 23, 30 and 49, which did not surprise Dr Street. "I don't think it's doing any favours to people in terms of their sexual values," she said. "Especially young people, who might not have a lot of other sexual experience to compare to. "So once again it's a bit like Facebook in that sort of sense, it's the internet, if it's in addition to your real life, then that's completely different to when it's a substitute to your real life."

Featured Local News Business Entertainment Lifestyle Politics Press Releases Sci & Health Sports Technology Thursday, May 04, 2017, 02:06 AM ,  You are here:Home Local News Local School Districts Warn of ‘Google Docs’ Phishing Scam 0 Local School Districts Warn of ‘Google Docs’ Phishing Scam Published on May 3, 2017 An apparent email “phishing” scam spread around the country Wednesday afternoon, enticing people to click on what looked like valid Google link that instead exposed their personal information–and some Illinois school districts are warning parents of the suspicious emails.  Batavia Public Schools posted on Facebook that officials had blocked the email from its inboxes but said the attack was continuing nationwide. “If you or your child receives any emails that appear to be from a known or unknown contact containing a link to a Google Doc, please delete these e-mails and most importantly, DO NOT OPEN THE ATTACHED GOOGLE DOC,” the post warns. The emails have also reportedly come from Chicago Public School district emails as well as Barrington School District 220 and LaGrange School District 202 among others. Both suburban school districts posted warnings on Facebook to parents.  CPS offered guidance to employees if they clicked the tainted link and encouraged staff to change their passwords. “This scheme targeted google accounts worldwide, and we are investigating the potential impact to our system,” Michael Passman, a spokesman for the school district, said in a statement. “We quickly blocked incoming messages related to this scheme and provided guidance to staff to avoid these messages.” The email arrives with a subject line saying someone “has shared a document on Google Docs with you” and a link that says “Open in Docs.” The link appears to be legitimate, and clicking on it leads people to a page where they are asked to give “Google Docs” access to their Google account. But it is not the real Google Docs, and clicking the “Allow” button gives the potentially malicious app permission to read and delete emails and to manage contacts. It is not clear who is taking the data once users authorize access or what they are doing with it.  Newsrooms across the country reported being inundated with the emails, as did a variety of other organizations. The scam spread so quickly and so comprehensively that “Google Docs” was the top trending term on Twitter in the United States by 4:30 p.m. ET.  Cybersecurity officials at the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness tweeted that people should avoid clicking the link. A number of New Jersey school districts also warned that they had been struck and that students should not click.  A thread on the Google board on Reddit had hundreds of comments from people who had been exposed to the link and were trying to identify the source. Google did not immediately return a request for comment, but it did address the issue on Twitter. “We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you not to click through & report as phishing within Gmail,” the official (and verified) Google Docs account said.  Published 5 hours ago | Updated 3 hours ago Published in: Local News Recent Posts Asking Price of Chicago’s Historic Wrigley Mansion Drops Local School Districts Warn of ‘Google Docs’ Phishing Scam Rizzo Unveils New ‘Rizzo’s’ Breakfast Cereal Police Won’t Be ‘Targets,’ FOP President Says After 2 Shot Rizzo, Bryant Star in New ‘Bryzzo’ Outtakes Video Effort Continues to Confirm if Holmes Was Really Hanged Documents Detail Abduction, Assault of Missing Indiana Teen Police Investigate Possible Connection in Carjackings Forman, Paxson Vague on Butler’s Future With Bulls 3 Questioned After Officers ‘Targeted’ in Shooting: Police Bookmark and Promote!

People who click on the link can get pulled into a world of trouble so, first things first, do not click the link. Just delete it. tech Updated: May 04, 2017 08:07 IST Mountain View Reuters Spammers are using a malicious link to lure Gmail users in to divulging more information about themselves.(Google) Alphabet Inc warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs after a large number of people turned to social media to complain that their accounts had been hacked. Google said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. “This is the future of phishing,” said Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc. “It gets attackers to their goal ... without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device.” He said the hackers had also pointed some users to another site, since taken down, that sought to capture their passwords. Google said its abuse team “is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” Anybody who granted access to the malicious app unknowingly also gave hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. “This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,” said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data. tags Google Google Docs scam Google Docs news spammers attack Google users more from tech Google Docs email spam attack: Here is what to do if you already clicked the link May 04, 2017 07:59 IST Apple’s response to Trump: iPhone-maker to create $1 billion US advanced manufacturing fund May 04, 2017 07:10 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

The purpose of the scam, and the culprits behind it, remained unknown late in the day. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," a Google spokesperson said in an email response to an AFP inquiry. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again." The scam combined "a phishing attack and a worm," using a deceptive email to get people to open the door to malicious code that wriggled into their messaging programs to spread itself to others, according to Electronic Frontier Foundation staff technologist Cooper Quintin. Email sent from a known contact's real address would arrive containing a link it claimed led to a file to be shared at Google Docs online service, according to a rundown of the chicanery. Clicking the link led to a real Google web address and asked for authorization to run an application the attacker had cleverly called 'Google Docs.' Permissions granted to the application included allowing it to read or send email on a person's behalf. "It doesn't immediately look like a phishing email," Quintin said. "When you authorize the app, the very next thing it does is send the same emails to everyone in your contacts." The application, along with online domains it was connecting to, were disabled within hours of it starting to spread wildly, according to Quintin. "I suspect that it was far more successful than whoever released it into the world hoped or expected, and was maybe undone by its own success," he said. "The domains went down pretty quickly. Google disabled the app, so it is no longer a threat." The campaign affected fewer than a tenth of a percent of Gmail users, and was stopped within an hour, according to the California-based internet powerhouse. Gmail is reported to have more than a billion users. Google determined that while contact information was accessed, no other data was gleaned by the ruse, according to the spokesperson.

LG G6 already down to $500 at T-Mobile, plus free Google Home and G Pad X tablet Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 11:16am PDTMay 3, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares130 G6 LG News T-Mobile Just the other day we noticed that LG's G6 was $600 at B&H, and now the month-old flagship is down to $500 at T-Mobile. The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H, but, for those of you on the magenta carrier, it is $100 less and comes with a free G Pad X. You can even use it to take advantage of LG's current promo and pick up a Google Home. $500 for a phone, tablet, and Google Home is a pretty sweet deal if the $800 GS8 and its curvy screen doesn't appeal to you. I hope these rapid drops in price aren't a sign of trouble for LG, but in the meantime, they do serve consumers pretty well. The G6 was well regarded in our review. We found the screen to be a pretty great IPS panel if that's your preference. Battery life was also decent, and the size and feel of the phone both struck us well. If you're interested in trying out the future of flagship aspect ratios and rounded screens, the G6 is a decent way to go. The promotion for a free Google Home ($114 right now) sweetens the deal pretty well, too. All these offers have a couple of small caveats you should keep in mind if you're interested in picking up a free Google Home and G Pad X with your G6. For the Google Home you have to order your phone by May 7th, which is just a few days away, and you have to submit your registration for the promo online by the 22nd. The G Pad X requires that you hold a plan through T-Mobile with at least 2GB of data, and keep your service for 24 months. The precise terms and conditions are available at the links below.

Marty Not for a 32GB one these days. A flagship with last gen SoC, no quad DAC and the smallest memory. Simon Are you concerned by this? I'm not sure since you made only 3 comments in 3 minutes about it. Marty Yeah, I don't sound too concerned. But it's a concern. 😉 needa Making my third in three minutes here so you can see my concern also. needa $500 is the right price with those specs. Home is the bonus. Marty Get a Oneplus 3T. 128GB and SD821. Plus it has 6GB RAM. Mine works beautifully. And it's gorgeous. All for $480. needa Yeah but still have the screen and the cameras. I'd buy the 3T in a heartbeat over this. But I don't care that much about the 128. Most I ever had on my 64 OPO over the three years was thirty'ish. Deleted ten gb in roms and was back in action. Mike Not waterproof, much worse camera, update support is a giant question mark, screen is lower quality. One is a true flagship the other is a mid ranger and it shows. Marty What's wrong with the display? Mine's already updated to 7.1.1. And there's a plethora of software options in Beta. And the camera makes beatiful pics. It loads as fast as any Samsung camera. Mike If you're going to talk about current flagship specs, a screen from flagships released, what, two or three years ago doesn't make sense. Also, the OnePlus 2/X still hasn't seen Nougat, OnePlus has yet to prove they can continue with support for older devices. Marty Perfectly fine and beautiful display. It looks better than the display in my Nexus 6P. Bob Marley Except it's not. The pixel density on the OP3T display is effectively the same as the iPhone 7 due to the Pentile subpixel layout. If you have even average vision, the lack of sharpness is apparent, especially on text. Marty It looks gorgeous to me. And quantity isnt quality. needa The OPO ended with the November 2016 security patch. That is all of your fingers and toes, in months, plus a few more. They are lagging behind with the 2/x... no doubt. But they have proven support for older devices. More than some other mainstream OEMs. And with that... I have exceeded my maximum number of comments on a page by about six. See yall later. P. Sherman Sony released Nougat to Xperia Z5 and Z3+. They were released around the same time OnePlus 2 was released. Their attitude to OnePlus 2 and their users is beyond pathetic. needa Not denying they aren't behind. And not denying that they should throw the OP2 users a bone. But you can't use one example and generalize the company. Every single OEM has had their flagship that didn't get updated at a reasonable rate, or updated at all. "The beta test is over". needa hmm. ATT s6 just now getting nougat. I know I know. Oneplus is the worst. They released a new phone only few months after the s6 was released... and It DOesn't HAVe NOUGat YET? Omg. The travesty. Samsung must have been cracking the whip on their 'small team' of developers. tl;dr. It will all be ok. Life will go on. Marty Ohh...by the way, my G5 is on Android 6.0.1 with no sign of any future update. My G4 is on Android 6 and also with no sign of any future update. I'd say LG is worse than any of them for updates. needa 1080 vs 2k isn't about the quality. The 3T has a killer screen. Can't say anything about their support as the OPO that I finally sat down two days ago is still working as good as the day I got it. Just a bit long in the tooth. ie. three years of charging and hindered by the tech back then. Marty Thank you. Exactly. Resolution isn't a factor in quality just like MPs are a factor in picture quality. deibed LOL mike you're a savage, he was feeling all superior with his spec knowledge, and you come and hit him with facts...lol southerndinner Terrible support, never gets updated, incredibly unethical company, no IP rating and poor screen quality. I don't care much for LG but this is a way better deal than the 3T Marty What about my LG G4 and G5 that never get updated? My Oneplus 3T is on Android 7.1.1. The display is gorgeous and better looking than the display in my Nexus 6P. But let me guess, you're one of those people who equates screen quality with pixel resolution? If so, you probably determine a camera's quality based on its pixel count. Jasdeep Singh The S8 effect. LG remains under Samsung's shadow! Marty Because LG makes stupid decisions. Snubbing the American market isn't wise. New_Guy Not to mention they squandered their chance to take over Android the market by constantly putting sub-par cameras in the M-line (4 Ultra Pixels......c'mon man). The only reason I got the Moto X 2014 over the M8 was because of the camera. needa Definitely the new guy. HTC New_Guy Yeah, I was trippin' there for a second....been a long g day already. needa Lol. I hear yah. I have done the same thing before. New_Guy I'd delete the comment, but whatevs.... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Matthew Scott Smith I didn't see a mention of HTC in the above comments, but HTC is doing much worse than LG presently. New_Guy Yeah, I sort of lost myself there for a moment...been a long day, haha ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The S8 trumps the G6. Sammy got LG running like a scalded dog BC LG will eternally be the second and sometimes third best, as their poor choices are constantly going to make their phones less appealing. The gimped USA version had been a nonstarter to me, Smartworld is a POS...I didn't want to deal with that after the LG V20, which even after a factory reset started to become janky. I just wish LG would step up their game and become competition to Samsung. LG needs to freshen up their Android Skin, continue to work on their features and software. BigDeeNY99 exactly why i dont rush anymore to purchase the new next best phone.. Eric Vaughan Also comes with the LG G Pad X 8.0? Seems like a good deal. Marty LG disgusts me. Always skimping for the US market. 32GB max and no quad DAC. balthazar The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H[...] What are the differences? Ryne Hager T-Mobile has a more limited set of frequencies listed for their model, and B&H has the unlocked model that supports a pretty broad range. I can't be sure that the T-Mobile version is locked or unlocked or supports any frequencies outside what T-Mobile lists. Justin W Usually T-Mobile locks their network support. You can temporarily unlock, or permanent unlock, but that depends on your standing with the company. Well, unless this time around is different - the V20 I just picked up has those stipulations in place. Rod Flop much? Sohit will this work on Verizon? Margaritas Ante Porcos Great deal indeed. Although even in my medieval country g6 goes for around $600 bucks. Samsungs will drop s8 prices soon. Only few crazy nerds are buying those phones for 800. Suicide_Note A few thousand buy LG's wares, while millions have already bought the S8/S8+, and I'm sure they're not all 'nerds' as you put it. MRIANB Wow, LG is desperate and phone must not be selling against S8. Ryan Bartz Aside from the iPhone no phone can compete with Samsung. Samsung releases a respectable phone with half backed software (nothing has changed) and people forget about LG which is a damn good no gimmick phone Martin Watched couple videos on YouTube and the phone is pretty damn good. And this deal is pretty sweet. Wish I was in US... Here butt naked G6 is $650.... :) TechGuy22 299 and i'd buy it Marty Same for me. At that price point, not having the quad DAC and the small memory doesn't hurt too bad. sebastianer If they are powered with random bootlooping technology… I'm totally in. Arysyn While I'm not a fan of the LG G6, this isn't a bad price, especially for what is included. It would be an even better deal if priced to go against the ZTE Axon 7, as the G6 still is a much better device, despite the features I think LG ought to have included in the G6. JD At this rate you might as well just get right to where the G6 will end up. You get a free boot-looping G6 with the purchase of every Google Home. Mike The Galaxy S8 forced the markdown J_Grouchy The "free" tablet ($240 value) requires a $10/month data plan for 24 months. Funny how that math works... Mike in KC Now throw in a BOGO deal on top of that price and I'm in. southerndinner LOL in the bargain bin already RIP LG Mobile PhillipeFelut the V20 and G6 are 50% off on at&t next as well fyi DroidBlaze I'm still liking my s7e but if the US g6 had 64gb and the quad dac I would have seriously considered getting it. As is, the US g6 is just meh. calvini Just got the G6 from AT&T for $360 with the free tablet and I also had the option of getting the LG Smart watch for $50. Registered on LGs website to get the free Google home as well. I believe this promo lasts this whole month, but to be eligible for the Google home, you need to purchase the phone before the 7th of May. Not a bad deal at all through AT&T.

The robots are winning: Google's neural network OCR gives names to the nameless (streets) Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 5:35pm PDTMay 3, 2017 6 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares76 Google News Everyone uses Google Maps, but not often do we consider where, exactly, all that data comes from. When a new road goes in, or a bypass, or the name of a street changes, it isn't as if your local city reaches out to Google to make sure everything is up to date. Some of that used to come from user submissions in the Map Maker forum. Now those tools are being rolled into Maps itself, but that's not the only source of information. Google's fleets of Street View cars collect an insane number of images, and nestled in with them are pictures of businesses, street signs, and addresses, and Google's latest research blog post goes into some interesting details about all that potential data. Those signs might be recognizable as text to you and me, but they obviously aren't text to a computer. And, it wouldn't be cost-effective to have an army of people pouring over all those images just to enter them in plain text. That's where machine learning and neural networks start to come in handy (warning, wiki-hole). Really, though, a neural network is just a way of processing data via training, rather than by direct instruction. Instead of explicitly programming a system to do something, you put a system together that can be told when its results for a given input are right or wrong, and which then adapts weighted triggers in a hidden processing layer until the output is correct. Basically, you show it things and tell it what it should see, until it does. As an aside, you can actually make your own neural network at home pretty easily and do all sorts of fun stuff. In my college computational systems course I only ever used one to make an interpreter for portrait images to determine the sex of a person pictured, and even then I think I never got things above 65% accuracy. My point is, they're easier to understand than their complex name might imply.   Google is making use of these types of deep neural networks to read street names from images collected via Street View. It's basically just a method for OCR, and it has gotten very good, over 85% accuracy reading French street names. It knows which text in an image is important to a business name, street name, or address, and what isn't and can be safely ignored. It doesn't even get thrown off (too badly) by differences in formatting or font. Google's OCR tools have seen changes to over 30% of all addresses in Maps. In some locations, its use has resulted in over a 90% improvement. And, benevolently, Google has also been good about releasing their tools and models over the years for others to use. They did exactly that with their latest bit of OCR magic. Humorously, half of Google's mistakes from one particular model came down to so-called "ground truth" errors, which is a fancy way of saying the system was right, but the data provided was wrong. If you're even mildly interested in any of this, I really encourage you to check out the post on Google's research blog. It's super cool stuff.

It's called the Crowdsource app. Even if we are training the AI, Google doesn't get to say they just built an AI and its amazing. Carson Saldanha I think the Crowdsource app is more just to "verify" the information. Plus, there isn't that many people actively using it, and those that do are just Google fans. So naturally, all their data can't come from there. AQ Before the crowdsource app was the crowdsource website, each with their own contribution score. I've contributed hundreds on each & can assure you that the neural network misses allot. Also don't underestimate a multi billion dollar companies ability to find dirt cheap labor in other countries. ryraansh They also use these images in ReCaptcha Ryne Hager Indeed, some of the OCR information is probably verified through Crowdsource, or training for the apps set-up with known sets generated that way. Nonetheless, their neural nets are pretty cool, and they probably handle a whole lot more data than the people on Crowdsource do. Romario Maxwell As in. Every time I use hurl.it to test REST APIs and HTTP stuff, in the reCAPTCHA I either get mountains or street signs. Most of the time I'm challenged with street signs.

Google revealed the new feature in a post on its G Suite updates blog. Samsung U28E590D 28-Inch 4K Monitor Starting this week, when you click a suspicious link in an email, Gmail will show a new pop-up warning explaining that what’s on the other side of the link might be dangerous: Here is the message that will be presented; The site you are trying to visit has been identified as forgery, intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal, or other sensitive information. While users will still have the option to proceed to the website, Google hopes this warning will encourage users to be more cautious about what links they are clicking and where the link will take them: While not all affected email will necessarily be dangerous, we encourage you to be extra careful about clicking on links in messages that you’re not sure about. And with this update, you’ll have another tool to make these kinds of decisions. Google says that this feature is a gradual rollout and may take a few days to reach all users. Currently, the feature is coming to Gmail on Android and it’s unclear if it will come to other devices. If you’ve received the new security feature, let us know down in the comments.

By Boleo May 3, 2017 8:10 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Credit: Google/Boleo’s Sign In Page I know I am not the only person in Lubbock who got a warning about this one! I have seen all kinds of internet scams since the first time I used AOL in 1995. But this one is ugly and most people might not realize what is going on until it’s too late! This afternoon I received an email from one of our regional engineering/IT guys and it was talking about a new scam/hacker-esque email going around. But then I looked at Kotaku and saw a story on it. (Along with stories from BuzzFeed, Vice, DallasNews.com, etc.) The email will ask you to view a Google Doc file. But then it gets ugly. From Kotaku: “What’s even scarier than that, the page has a very real-looking Google.com URL and clicking on a link to Google Docs appears to confirm the page’s authenticity. It gets worse. That page invites to choose which account you’d like to use to view the Google Doc, and then you’re taken to a page that invites you to grant access to your Google Account.” Please for the love of everything good and holy on the internet don’t open an email like this. If you give the scammers access to your Google accounts, it is probably game over for you! As always if you get an email from someone who you don’t know or do business with, DO NOT OPEN ANY LINKS OR ATTACHMENTS WITHIN THE EMAIL! Or, better yet, just delete the email sight unseen.

The phishing emails, which circulated for about three hours before Google stopped them, invited the recipient to open what appeared to be a Google Doc. The teaser was a blue box that said, “Open in Docs.” In reality, the link led to a dummy app that asked users for permission to access their Gmail account. Reddit An example of the phishing email that circulated on Tuesday. Users might easily have been fooled, because the dummy app was actually named “Google Docs.” It also asked for access to Gmail through Google’s actual login service. The hackers were able to pull off the attack by abusing the OAuth protocol, a way for internet accounts at Google, Twitter, Facebook and other services to connect with third-party apps.   The OAuth protocol doesn’t transfer any password information, but instead uses special access tokens that can open account access. However, OAuth can be dangerous in the wrong hands. The hackers behind Tuesday’s attack appear to have built an actual third-party app that leveraged Google processes to gain account access. Reddit The dummy app will try to ask for account permission.  “The attack is quite clever and it exploits the ability for you to link your Google Account to a third-party application,” said Mark Nunnikhoven, vice president of cloud research at security firm Trend Micro. Exploiting OAuth for account access is particularly devious because it can bypass the need to steal someone's login credentials or even Google's 2-step verification. Last month, Trend Micro said a Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear was using a similar email attack method that abused the OAuth protocol to phish victims. However, security experts said Tuesday's phishing attack probably wasn't from Fancy Bear, a shadowy group that many experts suspect works for the Russian government. "I don't believe they are behind this ... because this is way too widespread," Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at security provider AlienVault, said in an email.  On Tuesday, many users on Twitter, including journalists, posted screen shots of the phishing emails, prompting speculation that the hackers were harvesting victims' contact lists to target more users. The attack was also sent through an email address at "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com." Mailinator, a provider of a free email service, denied any involvement.  Fortunately, Google moved quickly to stop the phishing attacks, after a user on Reddit posted about them. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again,” Google said in a statement. Security experts and Google recommend affected users check what third-party apps have permission to access their account and revoke any suspicious access. Users can do so by visiting this address, or performing a Google security check-up. It's also good practice to be careful around suspicious-looking emails. Many hacking attempts, including malware infections, come through links or attachments sent over email. Security firms are warning that other hackers may conduct similar phishing attacks abusing OAuth, not just through Google, but with Facebook and LinkedIn.  "Like all other creative, novel approaches, it will likely be heavily copied almost immediately," Cisco's Talos security group said in a blog post. Talos has identified more than 275,000 applications that use OAuth and connect to the cloud.  But even though Tuesday's attack may have been novel, the dangers with OAuth are hardly new. Security experts have warned in the past that users may be phished through manipulation of OAuth to grant permissions to the wrong party. In response to such attacks, Google said last month that it reviews any OAuth abuse and takes down thousands of apps that violate its user data policy, including those that impersonate company products. Tuesday's phishing scheme will probably push Google to adopt an even stricter stance on apps that use OAuth, said Robert Graham, CEO of research company Errata Security. However, the internet giant has to strike a balance between ensuring security and fostering a flourishing app ecosystem.  "The more vetting you do, the more you stop innovation," Graham said.

Roston - May 3, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Some Google Docs users were hit with a very convincing, very real-looking phishing email today that some, unfortunately, fell for. The email claimed that someone had shared a document with the Google user, who would then click on the link and be taken to a real Google page to select their Gmail account. Choosing the account, though, led to a fishy page that requested access to the user’s account, and it only got worse from there. An alert about the phishing email came from a Redditor who posted a full write up about the email and how it works to the social website. While many phishing emails are easy to spot, this one is quite the opposite, and it’s easy to see how someone less familiar with the Internet would fall for the scam. Those who do fall for the phishing email ultimately end up giving the scammers access to their address book and email. The access can be revoked here. Following the Redditor’s publication of the phishing attempt, a Google employee stated that he or she had escalated the issue to the appropriate teams within Google to get the problem fixed. Less than 30 minutes after the scam became public, Google has implemented a solution, which included disabling the scammer’s accounts. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail,” the company went on to say in a statement. That’s great, of course, and Google should be commended for squashing the problem so quickly…but don’t get complacent. The phishing attempt was obviously a human-created thing, and so ultimately there’s nothing for Google to truly ‘fix’ the problem. While this scammer was taken down, there are thousands more ready to take their place and they’ll likely get more clever as time goes on. Phishing emails are an unfortunate reality, and one that can’t be easily eliminated. Emails can come from seemingly any company, including banks and medical facilities, and often times a user doesn’t realize they were tricked until it is too late. When in doubt, delete the email.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Alphabet Inc warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs after a large number of people turned to social media to complain that their accounts had been hacked. Google said today that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. “This is the future of phishing,” said Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc. “It gets attackers to their goal ... without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device.” He said the hackers had also pointed some users to another site, since taken down, that sought to capture their passwords. Google said its abuse team “is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” Anybody who granted access to the malicious app unknowingly also gave hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. “This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,” said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours this afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.  Related Items google , Alphabet Inc , Gmail Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

ROS LBoard 1 Pakatan Harapan invites public to submit logo design FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Google Docs phishing scam doused after catching fire AFP | May 4, 2017 The scam combined "a phishing attack and a worm," using a deceptive email to get people to open the door to malicious code that wriggled into their messaging programs to spread itself to others. UPDATED SAN FRANCISCO: A ‘phishing’ scam that tricked people with what appeared to be Google Docs links was doused by the internet giant after spreading wildly. The purpose of the scam, and the culprits behind it, remained unknown late in the day. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” a Google spokesperson said in an email response to an AFP inquiry. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” The scam combined “a phishing attack and a worm,” using a deceptive email to get people to open the door to malicious code that wriggled into their messaging programs to spread itself to others, according to Electronic Frontier Foundation staff technologist Cooper Quintin. Email sent from a known contact’s real address would arrive containing a link it claimed led to a file to be shared at Google Docs online service, according to a rundown of the chicanery. Clicking the link led to a real Google web address and asked for authorization to run an application the attacker had cleverly called ‘Google Docs.’ Permissions granted to the application included allowing it to read or send email on a person’s behalf. “It doesn’t immediately look like a phishing email,” Quintin said. “When you authorize the app, the very next thing it does is send the same emails to everyone in your contacts.” The application, along with online domains it was connecting to, were disabled within hours of it starting to spread wildly, according to Quintin. “I suspect that it was far more successful than whoever released it into the world hoped or expected, and was maybe undone by its own success,” he said. “The domains went down pretty quickly. Google disabled the app, so it is no longer a threat.” The campaign affected fewer than a tenth of a percent of Gmail users, and was stopped within an hour, according to the California-based internet powerhouse. Gmail is reported to have more than a billion users. Google determined that while contact information was accessed, no other data was gleaned by the ruse, according to the spokesperson.

Google lawyers alleged that the company’s former engineer and current Uber employee Anthony Levandowski stole 14,000 confidential documents off a computer owned by Waymo, Google’s self-driving spinoff. Lawyers for Uber repeatedly failed to dispute this portion of the presented facts while defending themselves against a gargantuan Waymo suit. And the judge seemed convinced. “You have one of the strongest records I’ve seen for a long time of anybody doing something that bad,” Judge William Alsup told Waymo lawyer Charles Verhoven, who works for the law firm Quinn Emanuel. “Good for you.” The open question is what happened next. Related Video Meet the Blind Man Who Convinced Google Its Self-Driving Car Is Finally Ready Waymo alleges Levandowski used trade secrets in those swiped documents to launch his own self-driving truck startup, Otto, shortly after departing from Google in January 2016. By August, Otto had been snapped up by Uber for an amazing $680 million. Then, the Waymo story goes, the secrets to its sophisticated lidar system—the tech that enables self-driving cars to “see”—made its way into Uber technology. Waymo alleges trade secret theft and patent infringement. On Wednesday, the search giant’s lawyers tried to make the case that its predicament was so severe—the costs to its business so high—that Alsup should issue a preliminary injunction halting Uber’s self-driving activities involving the lidar. Once a competitor takes advantage of a swiped trade secret, “you can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube,” said Verhoven. Shorter: They’re using our tech in their self-driving cars, so shut ‘em down. What’s not quite proven yet: That the complex lidar system Levandowski built for Uber was heavily inspired by Waymo-owned patents and trade secrets. Waymo also can’t quite pin down whether Uber employees saw the stolen documents or if those documents moved anywhere beyond the computer Levandowski allegedly used to steal them. (Uber lawyers say extensive searches of their company’s system for anything connected to the secrets comes up nil.) Did a laptop containing the documents ever enter an Uber office? Did Levandowski access the documents for reference while working from home? So far, the evidence is only circumstantial. Alsup was quick to point out the gaps in Waymo’s story. “I’ve given you lots of discovery, and so far you don’t have any smoking gun,” he told Waymo lawyers. But Waymo complained Levandowski’s decision to assert his Fifth Amendment rights has seriously hampered the proceedings against Uber. (Levandowski himself is in arbitration with his former company.) Lawyers for Waymo also said Uber had blocked the release of 3,500 documents related to the acquisition of Otto on the grounds that they contain privileged information. The self-driving market is hot, Waymo lawyers said, which meant this evidence’s absence, plus the suspicion that Uber is using pilfered tech in its self-driving cars, should be grounds for a preliminary injunction. But if the tech-head gawkers, besuited lawyers, and tap-tapping reporters who packed into Alsup’s chambers Wednesday wanted resolution, they were disappointed. Alsup did not rule on the preliminary injunction from the bench. Instead, while waiting for his judgment to come sometime in the next few days, Uber’s self-driving program lives on.

Or the judge could deny the injunction, leaving the rest of the lawsuit, along with its scary business implications for Uber, to simply take its course. Remember: This case is still in the preliminary stages. Though Uber’s lawyers said they’ve already pawed through terabytes—terabytes!—of information, the evidence-collecting is just getting started. But it’s Waymo that has a tough road here. The bar for an injunction is high, and most judges aren’t comfortable with temporarily halting anything without reams of proof. “It’s Waymo’s burden,” says Courtland Reichman, a trial lawyer with the law firm McKool Smith. “They have to come forward with evidence if they want to win.” Meanwhile, here’s the weird thing: None of technology discussed in this bombshell lawsuit is actually making money yet. The concept of robo-cars may freak out a cross-section of the public, but today’s injunction hearing makes clear that the companies involved see this as a big money business. “There is going to be an IP war in this area,” Bryan Reimer, who studies self-driving vehicles at MIT, told WIRED last month. “And this is the first of many.” The engineers sure are doing some cool work on self-driving cars, but today’s courtroom action was a reminder that the lawyers just might run the show.

A phishing scam is a way of manipulating a victim into providing access to your accounts without their knowledge or by tricking them with a fake login page that looks like the real one. Google says that it has disabled the accounts associated with the scam and will take necessary precautions to prevent a similar kind of attack. Developers will likely no longer be able to name things after other Google services word for word. (1 of 3) Official Google Statement on Phishing Email: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs... Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 (2 of 3) & have disabled offending accounts. Weve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team... Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 (3 of 3) is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 If you clicked on the link and were affected by todays attack, Google says you should visit myaccount.google.com/permissions to revoke the Google Docs app. Google Docs doesnt require separate authorization as Gmail gives it by default. Heres what had gone down earlier today: an email would be sent to you, presumably from someone youd know asking you to accept a Google Doc share request. Clicking the link takes you to a Google-hosted page where youd be asked to log into your Gmail account, still, from a Google page. So this link would take you to a third-party app, ironically, also called Google Docs. This app requests your accounts permissions and clicking Allow opens a can of worms. The app accesses all your contacts and sends them a similar fate. Its not to say that todays event could have been avoided, someone found a loophole and abused it and the victim could have been even the most savvy of internet users. If any app ever requests permission to access sensitive information like your contacts, you should proceed with caution.

It is not clear who is behind the phishing effort. The phishing attempt spread across the internet for several hours before Google appeared to at least block the page allowing users to give data permissions.  Load Error Google said in a statement sent to CBS News that by late Wednesday afternoon it had disabled accounts associated with the phishing attempt.

A specific email, shown above, has been making waves in the news and Google has released an official statement regarding it. First, you may be wondering why this specific message is worth talking about. First, it looks identical to normal Google Docs invitation emails. When the 'Open in Docs' link is clicked, the user is asked to give "Google Docs" access to their Google account. Essentially, someone made a web app that identifies itself as Google Docs, easily tricking anyone not paying close attention. @zeynep Just got this as well.

True story. creep_the_night The Android version doesn't get quite that hot, but it does heat up pretty well.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 73 Plus 1 on G+ 212 Share on Facebook 117 Share on Twitter Total Shares402 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws.

Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

Google expected to discontinue YouTube Accelerator to focus on deploying WiFi networks Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 10:00am PDTMay 3, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares86 Google News Rumors Google announced an interesting product last year called YouTube Accelerator that aimed to do away with buffering by caching YouTube videos on local networks. Accelerator initially launched in a handful of locations in the Philippines, but now Google is rumored to be dropping Accelerator. Instead, it's just going to work on rolling out faster WiFi in public spaces as part of the Google Station program. This news comes by way of The Information, which spoke to someone associated with the project. With Accelerator, operators of WiFi networks in places like malls, hospitals and airports had a special Google server that cached the 100,000 top videos on YouTube. When using YouTube while connected to that network, videos with offline versions were indicated with an Accelerator icon. Users could watch those videos with almost no buffering. YouTube Accelerator never expanded beyond the Philippines, but Google has talked about bringing it to India. However, the company is apparently looking at a different way to lessen buffering that doesn't require custom hardware. The solution may be Google Station, an initiative in India to deploy fast WiFi hotspots. Google won't sell hardware to anyone, but it will reportedly offer an online management console to hotspot operators. So, keep an eye out for some announcements on this front.

You'd have thought they would have accumulated about six different initiatives in the space of about a year, as usual. JG Tangentially related Google fanboy wet dream request rant... Google expected to discontinue YouTube Accelerator to focus on deploying WiFi networks Speaking of Google deploying WiFi networks... I don't think it'd fall under Google Station exactly, but I would LOVE to see Google light up their Fiber'hoods with WiFi. When cables are buried, you need to set up maintenance access boxes every so often. These boxes could very easily include WiFi (and maybe also cell) routers. Google could also take a page from Comcast's playbook and expand the WiFi coverage using a secondary network on Fiber subscriber's routers. I would suggest a three (or more) tiered system. A totally free tier open to anyone but it's throttled to say 3-5Mbps max and has lowest priority on the network. Or you could sign up for a paid subscription that grants you higher priority on the network and faster connection speeds. Maybe Google sets up a few levels. $5/month bumps you to 10Mbps $20 bumps you to 50Mbps.... Then, finally, Google Fiber and/or Project Fi subscribers, who get access to the top tier, 1Gbps and highest priority. Then, as long as I remain within the Fiber'hood area, I get outstanding internet speeds at home and while I'm out and about. Plus my cell bill stays at just $20/month, even though I pull down terabytes of data while streaming music at the beach (once San Diego finally comes online) xyz I don't really see the relation. Accelerator is for speeding up YouTube, while Station is a public Wi-Fi network at railway stations. akshay7394 which they can control the speeds of, and ensure that the effect is the same - instantaneous or near-instantaneous content.

FINANCIAL SENSE 04 May 2017 FS Insider Login Home Podcast Technician Big Picture Lifetime Income FS Insider Expert List Sponsors Blog Subscribe Video Contributors About Us Contact Us Mission & History Parent Company Site Statistics Invest With Us Commodities Economy Energy Global Markets Metals Storm Watch Home Subscribe   Alphabet’s New Plan to Track 10,000 People Could Take Wearables to the Next Level The Conversation05/03/2017 Print Bennett Allan Landman, Vanderbilt University Verily – the life sciences research arm of Google parent company Alphabet – wants to track the health of 10,000 people. Read A Survival Guide for the Coming AI Revolution On April 19, the group announced that it was starting to recruit for Project Baseline, in partnership with Duke and Stanford. Over the course of four years, Project Baseline will sequence participants’ genomes, test their blood, survey them and track biometric data such as heart rate and activity level on a Study Watch – basically, a Fitbit on steroids. What I find perhaps most interesting is their plan to collect thousands of medical images, which my colleagues and I also are doing in a big data analysis of childhood brain development. Ventures like Project Baseline open up new opportunities in health care, both for the researchers working with big data and for consumers who want more sophisticated ways to track their health. This allows us to start asking questions like: “How should we modify our behavior based on real-time interactions? Is there something relatively painless that anyone can do to alter their risk for particular medical problems? What can make us a healthy society that may be easier or more effective than the current recommendations?” Project Baseline in context Ten thousand people is a lot. To put that number into perspective, Project Baseline will follow enough participants to fill First Tennessee Park, Nashville’s new minor league baseball stadium. In the US, we define a rare disease as something that strikes about five in 10,000, so several rare diseases will likely be seen in Project Baseline. Hundreds of other participants will likely develop more common illnesses, such as heart disease or diabetes, over the study’s four years. Big data is nothing new for medicine. Project Baseline has been compared with the Framingham Heart Study, a project that tracked 5,209 subjects from 1948 on. Just this year, Stanford University researchers presented a paper in Nature that analyzed 129,450 clinical images to detect skin cancer. Meanwhile, the U.K. Biobank study is currently following the health of 500,000 adults. Just a day after the Project Baseline announcement, a study using U.K. Biobank data indicated bicycling to work was associated with a 46 percent lower risk of heart disease. My team is working with brain scans of up to 10,000 children, to look at how brain growth correlates with disease status, age, phenotype, genetics and other characteristics. As a biomedical engineer, I am focused on building tools that allow neuroscientists and psychiatrists to ask the hard questions and discover others we didn’t know we could or should ask. We begin to model and understand differences, and Verily is going to see the same sort of thing. Researchers need large amounts of data to test many ideas and uncover subtle relationships. The less well-framed an idea is, the more data we need to collect, in order to better understand the connections between genetics, environment, and health. New Applications Where Project Baseline stands to break new ground in medical research that tracks people over time is in its use of wearable devices. Project Baseline continues a 2014 pilot study of 200 healthy participants that included both a comprehensive health assessment and data collection through wearable devices. The new study could help advance Google’s wearable devices from general wellness products – which are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – to medical devices that capture specific information, with their safety and benefits proved to the FDA. That’s really exciting because, while everyone loves their Fitbit, we don’t know which diseases could be mitigated by using it. We could see Fitbit and similar devices being used the way doctors advise patients to use the automated blood pressure cuffs at Walgreens: Eat a certain way, exercise a certain amount, take your medication and check the results on your device. Moreover, with Alphabet/Google’s track record of affordable access to data resources (think Google Maps), Project Baseline could be a huge win for smaller companies seeking to build businesses around personal health devices. It also could open up better medical information to those in rural areas or those studying rare diseases. There are implications as well for radiology since Project Baseline will also collect medical imaging on its participants. Everybody loves to see an image. However, there is a lot of information in images that we’d like to better automatically pick out. Just as big data can improve personalized health devices, it can also boost our ability to extract subtle signs of disease in images. Doing Big Data Right My team looks at data in anonymous ways, in order to protect the privacy of the patients who donated it. For example, in addition to removing patient names, we are careful to protect dates of visits and other information unique to a patient. Verily’s newest project could have exciting implications for groups like ours, as the organization promises to provide anonymous data to qualified researchers. It will be critical for Verily to build trust in the anonymous nature of this data. Patients generally don’t mind being seen at a teaching or research hospital, knowing that doctors will learn from their care, but they absolutely don’t want their insurance agents or co-workers to know what treatments they might be receiving. The same goes for real-time health data like the kind that Project Baseline is collecting. Verily must ensure that there is no way to connect the data back to individual subjects, just as we are doing. In addition, the deep level of these medical records can open unlimited possibilities in computer-guided health care. But, for any such work, it’s essential that you are able to check your results. If for instance, we suspect that a particular brain area develops earlier than another, we can design the model in one data set, then show with another subgroup from the data that, in this population that we studied, our finding still holds true. Project Baseline will provide a wealth of data to develop new hypotheses and to replicate results from other studies.

Peter Bright - May 4, 2017 12:15 am UTC reader comments 66 Share this story Hands-on with some of the cheap education systems. Video shot and edited by Jennifer Hahn. Microsoft's New York City event to launch Windows 10 S and the Surface Laptop appears to have confused many people. The larger theme of the event was "education," but this is a broad topic. Judging by many of the reactions, Microsoft didn't do a good job of distinguishing the Surface Laptop from its offerings and ambitions for K-12 education. When introduced, the Laptop was still given an education spin, but in a very different context: college-students, rather than middle and high schoolers. Both of these are important, but they're important in different ways, and the challenges Microsoft faces are very different. While Surface Laptop is the most eye-catching of the company's announcements, it is, like the other Surface hardware, intended as more of a high-end halo product rather than a mass-market device. Surface Laptop was arguably the least important part of what Microsoft presented. Windows 10 S, and the range of education-oriented systems starting at $189, are a far bigger deal. Enlarge / One of the more visible changes in Windows 10 S is the new wallpaper. Microsoft Middle- and high-school education has usage models that are not common in most other spheres. For example, while Windows has long supported individual user accounts, the use of highly shared systems—in which each student grabs a laptop from a cart at the start of a lesson (or sits down at a lab PC) and logs in, having never used that particular machine before—is much less common in home or corporate scenarios. Corporate deployments of hundreds of computers would almost always have some kind of on-site administrative staff along with centralized management using Active Directory and Group Policies. School environments are often far more ad hoc, without that same central management and much greater use of hands-on maintenance. This means that school environments are often relatively poorly served by the traditional IT department-oriented management tools, diluting strengths that Windows might otherwise have. The school market is also not one that's entrenched in the same way as the corporate desktop. Apple has, for many years, had a strong presence in US education, though this success wasn't felt in the rest of the world. The newest threat in the education landscape, however, is seeing global reach: Chrome OS. Finding its niche Google's locked-down operating system wasn't particularly designed for education. It was built as a browser-based operating system for using Google's ecosystem of cloud services. But the properties Google gave Chrome OS made it a good fit for education. The operating system uses the Linux kernel and offers a desktop environment substantially built around the Chrome browser. Google built it in a deliberately restrictive, secure way; for example, Chrome OS automatically upgraded, it didn't allow locally installed applications, and it used digital signatures to ensure the operating system wasn't tampered with. While some of these restrictions have been somewhat lifted—the operating system now has full support for running locally installed Android applications, though they remain sandboxed and restricted—it remains a highly constrained environment. With cloud-based applications and a locked-down operating system, there's just not a whole lot that people can do to break Chrome OS. This makes the OS substantially immune to both vandalistic students and hackers alike. Machines running Chrome OS are also very cheap. While Google has dabbled with high-end, highly designed, expensive machines, Chromebooks—with both x86 and ARM processors—have been available for just a couple of hundred bucks. Chromebooks have largely resurrected the Netbook concept and its pricing. Enlarge / Microsoft reckons that schools will use Teams to let their students chat with experts via Skype. Microsoft Add to this G Suite (formerly Google Apps) for Education—Google makes its suite of cloud services free for schools—and cloud-based administrative tools, and Chrome OS is an attractive option for schools that are cash-strapped and short on skilled IT staff. Moreover, Chrome OS is showing some international reach, succeeding not just in US classrooms, but those of Sweden and beyond. This wider adoption makes Chrome OS threatening to Microsoft in a way that Macs in education weren't. The prospect that Microsoft faces is that a generation of school kids will go through their education without using the twin mainstays of Windows and Office. The problem for Microsoft won't be that these kids are hostile to the company's software; rather, they'll be ignorant of it, having never had that exposure. When those kids enter the workforce, they'll be familiar with Google's apps and Chrome, of course. They just won't have any particular interest in Windows or Office, and they are much less likely to expect to use them or, for that matter, want to use them. Microsoft has arguably seen this same issue on a smaller scale already. The popularity of Macs in (especially) US universities means that many graduates that might once have been expected to have Windows expertise don't. Their experience is macOS, the bash command-line, and Unix-like systems. We've heard from people within the company that this caused issues when hiring new graduates: they weren't familiar with the Windows way of developing, and they had to learn a new set of skills. Much improved PC hardware, along with the Windows Subsystem for Linux has given Redmond some ability to push back in this particular field. Windows 10 S and Microsoft's new education features are intended as the wider answer. On the hardware front, the price is right. Windows 10 S systems for schools will start at $189. Bump up to $300 and you can add touch and pen support, spill-resistant keyboards, and shock-absorbing designs. We'd expect that, for the most part, any x86 Chromebook will also have a comparable Windows 10 S version, especially among education-oriented systems. Leveling the playing field The promise of Windows 10 S on client machines is much the same as that of Chrome OS. Windows 10 S can run a browser (Edge, this time, rather than Chrome), and it can run apps from a store (the Windows Store, of course, rather than the Google Play Store). 10 S automatically updates, it uses cryptographic certificates to protect against tampering, and, as long as Microsoft has implemented the Store-based restriction effectively, it should offer comparable robustness and resilience against both hackers and students alike. Microsoft is also recognizing the shortcomings of existing IT-oriented administration facilities. The company has built a deployment tool, "Set Up School PCs," for configuring Windows 10 systems. This doesn't depend on corporate capabilities such as Intel vPro management, PXE remote booting, or Active Directory and Group Policy, because they're simply not features of these environments. Instead, Set Up School PCs uses USB keys: the deployment tool builds a configuration—setting up things like networking, pre-installed apps, and even system wallpaper—and writes it to a USB drive. That USB drive is inserted into client machines for about 30 seconds each, and it sets them up. With a handful of USB sticks, hundreds of machines can be configured in a few hours. Hands-on administration is a necessarily reality in this field; Microsoft's goal is to make it better and simpler. Once systems are up and running, administration moves over to the cloud. The Intune device-management service sports additional education-oriented features, such as offering "test" accounts that lock down systems when they're being used to run examinations, and built-in support for school concepts such as teachers, students, and different grades, so that policies can be applied to the organizational units that make most sense in education settings. Both the remote deployment tools and Intune for Education have been in beta since the start of the year, and both now head into general availability. Enlarge / OneNote has education features. Microsoft With similar pricing and operating-system robustness, Microsoft has arguably equalized its position on the client. And in other areas the company might well have an advantage. Just as Google makes G Suite for Education free, Microsoft similarly makes the cloud-based Office 365 for Education, with access to the various Office Web apps, free. Some of these apps don't (yet) have any Google counterpart; Office 365 for Education includes Microsoft Teams, the company's Slack-like chat and collaboration service. This is being pushed as an ideal tool for collaborative and group projects. OneNote, similarly, has education-oriented features such as Class Notebooks, which can sync with digital whiteboards. Digital whiteboards give kids a single place to both take their own lesson notes and review those presented by their teacher. And Windows 10 S can, of course, run the Office desktop applications. The Office desktop apps will soon be included in the Windows Store, and while education access to the desktop apps isn't free, the option of using these considerably more powerful applications is not something that exists on Chromebooks. Chrome OS in education isn't going to go away, and its features are still going to appeal to educators. But with Windows 10 S, Intune for Education, Office 365 for Education, and the Chromebook-priced Windows machines, Microsoft has offerings to match every element of Google's education platform. Schools may still pick Google's platform, but it now has stiff competition it didn't before. Listing image by Peter Bright Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Google is warning users Wednesday, May 3, 2017, to beware of a phishing scam spread by a fraudulent invitation to share a Google Doc. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google said it shut down an email spam campaign that impersonated its online file service, Google Docs. According to online reports — in particular, a detailed user thread on Reddit — clicking on an emailed share link, purportedly from a known source, was taking users to a site that asked permission for a fake app calling itself "Google Docs" to access their accounts. If they agreed, the app would then send additional copies of the original email to the users' contacts. Earlier reports suggested the attack was a phishing scam potentially aimed at harvesting personal information and maybe even Google login credentials. But in a statement late Wednesday, Google said that while the campaign accessed and used contact information, no other data was apparently exposed. Google said it was able to stop the campaign in about an hour. It has disabled offending accounts, removed fake pages and updated its Safe Browsing feature, which issues warnings when users visit dangerous sites. Users don't have to take additional action, although Google encouraged those who want to be extra safe to run its security check feature. One telltale sign for identifying the spam email: It appears to be directed to the address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com, and is only blind copied to the recipient.

It's Best Not To Click By Colin Dwyer | NPR Wednesday, May 3, 2017 This is what the subject line may look like in the email, for people using Microsoft Outlook. The telltale sign something's amiss: that email address with that long line of H's. Screenshot by NPR There's a decent chance you — or someone you know — just got an odd email inviting you to edit a document in Google Docs. The email could be from a stranger, a colleague or a friend, but it's addressed to a contact that boasts a whole string of H's in its name. In other words, it looks a little something like this: Or, if you're looking at the invite in Gmail, it likely looks more like this: Either of these look familiar to you? Here's a handy tip: Don't open the link. Those invitations aren't what they seem. They are in fact malicious files intended to hijack recipients' accounts — and Google advises its users not to open them. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," a Google spokesperson says in a statement emailed to NPR. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing," the statement continues, "and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." If this public service announcement has reached you too late and you're now staring in despair at an already opened link, Vice's Motherboard explains what to do next: "If you have clicked on the link, go to your Google account's page (https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) where you can manage the permissions you've granted to apps (or go through the whole Google Security Checkup). Then locate the 'Google Doc' app. This looks totally legitimate, but it's actually not. If that's the malicious app that's gotten access to your account after you clicked on the link it should have a recent 'Authorization Time.' Now, click on that Google Docs app and click 'Remove.' " And, in case it helps, know at least that you're not alone. Many people — especially journalists — reported receiving these invites Wednesday afternoon. Enough people, in fact, that the hashtag #PhishingScam began trending on Twitter and email inboxes clogged with nearly as many warnings about the scam as instances of the scam itself. So, once you successfully delete that phishy email — or take steps to remove its gnarled claws from your hapless inbox — you can take comfort in the fact that, no matter what ails you, Twitter has some snark to cure it.

Chrome OS in education isn't going to go away, and its features are still going to appeal to educators. But with Windows 10 S, Intune for Education, Office 365 for Education, and the Chromebook-priced Windows machines, Microsoft has offerings to match every element of Google's education platform. Schools may still pick Google's platform, but it now has stiff competition it didn't before. Listing image by Peter Bright Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Waymo, formerly Google's "self-driving car" company, is suing Uber for using technology stolen by former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski. By Heather Kelly SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Accusations of theft, conspiracies and withholding evidence were flying during a contentious hearing between Uber and Alphabet's Waymo in San Francisco on Wednesday. Waymo, formerly Google's "self-driving car" company, is suing Uber for using technology stolen by former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski. It's asked the judge to put a halt on Uber's self-driving R&D until the case is settled. Uber is free to continue working on its self-driving cars for the moment, while federal judge William Alsup wrangles with a lack of evidence, either damning Uber or vindicating it. Levandowski left Waymo in January 2016 to start autonomous truck company Otto, which Uber bought for $680 million in August 2016. Waymo claims he absconded with 14,000 top secret documents, an allegation that Judge Alsup said was not in question. Waymo believes Uber used details about its LiDAR technology, which uses lasers and radar to collect information about the surrounding environment. It's not just accusing Uber of using proprietary information. According to Waymo, Uber collaborated with Levandowski while he was still at Google. As part of the plan, Waymo's attorney's say Levandowski left Waymo specifically to build an independent company using the stolen technical information that Uber could then buy. "There's this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal," said Waymo council Charles Verhoeven in court Wednesday. Waymo pointed to documents that show Levandowski received 5 million Uber shares on January 28, 2016, the day after he quit Google without notice. An Uber spokesperson said the shares were actually granted in August 2016 when the deal closed. Backdating gives Levandowski credit for the time he was at Otto. Because his vesting is tied to meeting certain milestones, he actually has zero Uber shares that are vested at this time. However, Uber maintains it did not use any trade secrets from the documents in its own technology, and that no Uber employees even knew they existed until the lawsuit. Judge Alsup agreed it was not clear that Uber had used that information or had even known that Levandowski possessed it. That made Alsup wary of issuing an injunction. "You didn't sue him. You sued Uber. So what if it turns out Uber was totally innocent?," Alsup asked Verhoeven. "Let's say they are totally innocent and the worst thing they did was pay a lot of money to hire away a brilliant guy from another competitor?" Levandowski refused to answer questions during his deposition, taking the fifth amendment. Last week, Uber said Levandowski would step down as head of the self-driving team until the suit was settled. Uber is refusing to turn over 3,500 documents, claiming they contain privileged information about the Otto acquisition. However, its defense team tried to downplay the amount by showing how many documents and data they had provided. Lawyers and researchers collected over 229 terabytes of data, reviewed more than 300,000 documents, interviewed 85 employees and imaged the workstations of 131 workers, according to Uber. They only found one Google email, and it was unrelated to the case. Judge Alsup said that didn't prove the stolen information wasn't used, as Levandowski could have brought his own personal laptop into the office and worked off that. More depositions might be required to rule out similar scenarios. That could mean an assistant who saw Levandowski use the documents or even CEO Travis Kalanick. "We'll produce our CEO for deposition," said Gonzalez. "Nobody's hiding at Uber." Judge Alsup is expected to rule on the injunction this week, or he could ask Waymo to provide more evidence first.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home adds support for more connected devices By Ida Torres - May 3, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The dream of a smart, connected house is truly coming together as more and more devices and services are coming up with a way for you to control your house from just your smartphone and/or your voice commands. Google Home is one of those devices bringing everything (or almost everything) together in an ecosystem of connected devices. Now they are adding even more members to this family as they now support iHome, Leviton, Emberlight, and Samsung Artik Cloud connected devices. The new supported devices may not be household (pun-nish intended) names, but for those who have products from these brands in their homes, this means that your Google Assistant will be able to make them work and you can do it from the comfort of wherever you are in the house. Emberlight makes smart light bulb sockets while iHome brings connected smart plugs in this case. Leviton also makes smart switches and outlets that you will now be able to connect to your Google Home. Arktik Cloud is an Internet of Things platform from Samsung which connects several of their products, like Hue, WeMo, Kevo, etc. However, for this current update to Google’s connected speaker, only Legrand smart hubs are actually supported. So if you have any of these brands/products in your house, you only have to shout “Ok Google” to make them function. You will be able to see these services on the Google Home app and set them up accordingly. Hopefully, more supported devices and platforms will be added later on so your home could be really connected.

Google Docs Phishing Scam making the rounds 04.05.2017 at 1:00 am By BellaNaija.com Leave a Comment Quick warning! If there’s an e-mail in your inbox asking you to open a Google Docs from someone, and you don’t know who it is, don’t open it. It’s probably a phishing email disguised as a contact attempting to share a file from Google Docs, says Google. The scam is one of the oldest around, akin to sending an e-mail asking you to click a hyperlink. Do so, and hackers can get access to your information. The email appears to come from someone inviting the user to share a document. The sophisticated email looks very similar to one sent by Google, but appears to come from an individual Gmail account. Look closely and you’ll see the difference between bogus and fake. Google released a statement Wednesday, saying it had  taken action to protect users against the impersonating email, and have disabled offending accounts: We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. Source: USA Today About BellaNaija.com Living & Celebrating the African Dream!

The email appears to be an invitation to open a Google Docs link. Anyone who clicked the link was taken to a page which looked exactly like the real thing. Accepting the invitation gave the hacker access to the victim's account. "We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail," Google said on Twitter. If you received an unexpected invitation to view a Google Doc, there are two clues to look out for: the invitation is from an account named 'hhhhhhhhhhhhhh', but the email address belongs to someone that's emailed you before the developer information, revealed when you click on the app's name, reveals it is made by eugene.pupov@gmail.com - not Google. Giving the hacker access to your account bypasses other security measures you might have, including passwords and two-factor authentication. The email then gets forwarded onto anyone in your Gmail contacts list. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," Google said after being alerted to the scam. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again." Some Gmail users expressed disbelief Google's own spam protection failed to stop the emails getting into users' inboxes. A similar scam led to the infamous Hillary Clinton email scandal, after Democratic National Committee head John Podesta clicked on a link he shouldn't have.

Early on, Apple had an enviable position in K-12 and higher education, first with the Apple II and later the Mac, but later on lost ground to inexpensive Windows-based PCs. Then came the iPad and an Apple resurgence in the classroom, only to have that challenged by Google and its Web-centric Chromebooks. Meanwhile, Microsoft has been planning its return to the education market. The Redmond tech giant showed its hand on 2 May 2017 in a press event that glossed over the consumer and business realms for once and focused squarely on education. The keynote, brief as these things go, revealed a new Surface laptop intended primarily for use in classrooms, a new flavor of the Windows operating system – again, largely for student use – and a bunch of education-friendly software tools. Let’s break it all down, so those who work with or recommend Apple’s education solutions know what the alternatives are. Surface Laptop -- In education, both the iPad and Chromebooks have their problems. As a tablet, the iPad is a bit awkward for writing because it lacks an integrated physical keyboard. It’s pricey, too. Chromebooks have keyboards and tend to be less expensive but, unlike muscular and nicely constructed iPads, they have a reputation for being underpowered and chintzy. Microsoft aims to lick both problems with its new Surface Laptop, a well-built and powerful PC with a traditional clamshell configuration that’s also relatively affordable. Starting at $999, the 2.76 pound (1.25 kg) Surface Laptop uses beefy 7th-generation Intel Core processors, boasts an advertised 14.5 hours of battery life, and features a 13.5-inch, 3.4-million-pixel touch display with Gorilla Glass 3 for ruggedness (a must in the classroom). Microsoft claims this “PixelSense” display is the thinnest LCD touch screen on any notebook and brags that the laptop has 4 more hours of battery life than a 13-inch MacBook Pro under certain conditions. Aesthetics include anodized metal outside — in an Apple-like move, it comes in a choice of four shades: Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, Graphite Gold, and Platinum. Inside, the Surface Laptop uses warmer materials, including soft-to-the-touch Alcantara fabric surrounding the keyboard and trackpad — the same durable, stain-resistant polyester/polyurethane fabric found on the outside of Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablet keyboard covers. The Surface Laptop, which is 0.57 inches (14.47 mm) at its thickest point, is a notable departure from previous Surface gear that boasts less conventional designs. It’s neither a chunky Surface Book with a weird hinge and removable screen nor a Surface Pro tablet with detachable keyboard and metal flip-out stand. Windows 10 S -- Apple’s iOS and Google’s Chrome OS have a reputation for being simple to use and manage, though in radically different ways. Now Microsoft is offering a third choice, a simplified version of Windows it calls Windows 10 S and intends largely for classroom use. To that end, it’s somewhat limited: it only runs apps from Microsoft’s app store, leaving out many traditional desktop apps. The reasoning is similar to Apple’s with the Mac App Store: apps offered for download have been vetted for security and offer uniformity in how they are used, both of which are music to the ears of classroom tech administrators. But Microsoft has tried app-store-only Windows versions before without much success. Windows 10 S has other notable limitations. Users can’t designate a default Web browser other than Microsoft’s own Edge. Nor can they change the search provider to something other than Microsoft’s Bing. Microsoft announced that full-featured versions of its Office apps would be made available via the app store — until now, its app store offered only limited versions of the Office apps. Microsoft is also adapting its Edge Web browser with students in mind, adding a space for organizing tabs into groups, which could be useful for thematic organization when writing school papers and the like. Tech administrators also get a few goodies, including the option to upgrade any Windows 10 S PC to Windows 10 Pro (after which it cannot be reverted to Windows 10 S) and an option to set up classroom laptops automatically just by inserting a USB flash drive with Windows 10 S configuration specs. Microsoft is not keeping Windows 10 S to itself. In addition to the Surface Laptop, notebooks from the likes of Acer, Asus, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung, and Toshiba will run Windows 10 S. Some of these machines will reportedly cost as little as $189, putting them squarely in the same price range as cheap Chromebooks. Teams, Minecraft, and More -- Although Microsoft has been expanding into hardware, it’s a software company at its core, so it’s not surprising that Monday’s keynote focused on applications suitable for education. One of these is Microsoft Teams, group chat software initially released for the business market. In now offering it to the education market, the company said it will “make Teams the digital hub for the classroom where teachers and students come to collaborate and learn.” Focusing Teams on education is an important move for Microsoft to make because of the robust collaboration features built into Google’s productivity apps, which are widely used in schools as well as businesses. In addition, platform-agnostic products such as Slack are making group chat an essential part of modern collaboration in both business and education. Microsoft also made an announcement related to Minecraft, the popular world-building software it bought in 2014. It is now building in coding features aimed at students, which is not unlike how Apple positions its Swift Playgrounds coding app (see “Playing Around with Swift on the iPad,” 13 June 2016). These changes will integrate Minecraft with student-coding platforms like Tynker, ScratchX, and Microsoft’s MakeCode, along with grown-up coding technology JavaScript. In this manner, students can write code that makes things happen in Minecraft environments, like building structures. Again, this isn’t far off from what Apple does in Swift Playgrounds, although Minecraft is already hugely popular among the school-age set. Microsoft also announced a renewed push into “mixed reality” with students in mind. Mixed reality refers to a combination of virtual reality (where you strap on goggles to navigate simulated worlds) and augmented reality (which layers digital constructs onto the real world; think Pokémon Go). Gear like Microsoft’s HoloLens headset is intended to facilitate such blended experiences, with more Microsoft mixed-reality hardware said to be on the way (see “Windows Goes Universal… and Holographic,” 23 January 2015, and “On the iPhone, Virtual Reality Is Unofficially Real,” 17 June 2016). In addition, Microsoft announced a deal with education-content giant Pearson, which has pledged to offer mixed-reality content in a variety of topic areas, including health, commerce, history, and STEM (short for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The Third Option -- Despite the continued prevalence of Windows PCs in schools, Microsoft has clearly been feeling left behind by Apple and Google in the education market. To respond, Microsoft has adapted its core products into what it believes is a compelling package for educators and their administration overlords: a powerful, durable laptop that, along with a familiar operating system modified for increased ease of use and security. Also, Minecraft! Naysayers will note that the new Surface Laptop is not exactly education-priced: a starting price of $999 is steep compared to Chromebooks that can be had for as little as $200. Also, Microsoft’s education-focused message gets muddled when it makes comparisons to the MacBook Pro, which may be relevant in higher education, but less so in the K-12 classroom. Critics will also wonder why Microsoft is releasing yet another limited version of Windows. Didn’t it learn anything from the likes of Windows RT and Windows Starter Edition, two previous attempts to push simplified versions of its iconic operating system? But educators who are weary of rickety Chromebooks and keyboard-less iPads may look seriously at Microsoft’s offerings. And if that fosters competition, schools win in the end.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

By Asha McLean | May 3, 2017 -- 23:12 GMT (16:12 PDT) | Topic: Security A new phishing attack has appeared in inboxes around the world that masquerades as an email contact sharing a Google Doc. The emails appear to originate from a legitimate account, with the email addressed to hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com and dozens of contact email addresses blind carbon copied (bcc) in. More security news As challenges mount, FBI issues fewer secret subpoenas Hundreds of privacy-invading apps are using ultrasonic sounds to track you Can Google win its battle with Android malware? Fuze flaw exposed private business meetings to eavesdroppers Upon clicking the "Open in Docs" button on the standard Gmail pop-up, users are invited to click on the link to open the document, which also redirects them to a legitimate Google sign-in page. Users are then prompted to select one of their Google accounts using Google's normal sign-in system and asked to authorise an app called "Google Docs" to manage emails. However, the app called "Google Docs," which requests permission to read, send, and delete emails, is not a real Google app. Clicking the link authorises the attack, and a user's account will then be hijacked and used as an infection vector, repeating the same behaviour to every contact a user has ever emailed. It also bypasses 2 factor authentication, as well as login alerts. Users that have clicked "allow" have fallen victim to the campaign. If the scam has made its way into a user's Gmail account, it can be deleted by removing the false "Google Docs" app via Google's Security Checkup page. The search engine giant has asked customers to remove any apps they do not recognise. In a statement, Google said it has taken action to protect users against the email impersonating Google Docs and has also disabled offending accounts. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again," Google posted on Twitter.

By Brian Fung / The Washington Post If you’ve received an invitation to join a shared Google Doc that you weren’t expecting, you might want to steer clear of it. It’s probably a phishing scam that could compromise your account. Internet users everywhere are being spammed with what appear to be malicious invitations to log on to their Google accounts. Unlike your garden-variety cyberattack, many of the telltale signs that could tip you off that something is awry are absent. For example, the attack appears to work by tricking you into logging into your actual Google account, then granting a third party (your attacker) access to your account’s data. Having gained permission to access your contacts, the attacker then fires off spam invites to everyone in your address book. What makes this attack so tricky to detect is that it takes advantage of Google’s legitimate tool for sharing data with responsible third-party apps. Since the bogus invitation is being routed through Google’s real system, nothing is misspelled, the icons look accurate, and it’s hard to know something’s gone wrong until it’s too late. Google said Wednesday that it is working to ensure this type of “spoofing” doesn’t happen again. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” the company said in a statement. Staff at The Washington Post, students at New York University and even workers at the U.S. Agency for International Development have received warnings from IT administrators not to open the emails. Here is one such notice, obtained by The Post. Here’s one clue for identifying the fraudulent email: Included on the string of recipients is an email address that begins “hhhhhhhhhhhhhh” and ends in “mailinator.com,” a website that lets visitors obtain a temporary and disposable email address. So, until you hear otherwise, it’s probably best to hold off on any Google Docs usage for now. If you’ve clicked the link in the malicious email, you can revoke the attacker’s access by visiting https://myaccount.google.com/permissions and deleting the “Google Docs” app — which is the one pretending to be legitimate. A spokesperson for Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.   Most Read Spectacular video: Small plane crashes in Mukilteo MUKILTEO — Nobody was seriously injured Tuesday when a small plane crashed… May 3rd, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins and Dan Catchpole Lakewood High School grad getting a shot at the NFL It was perhaps the worst day of Dustin Stanton’s football career.

Staff at multiple media outlets, including CBS News and KTVA, reported receiving the emails, which look nearly identical to the actual ones Google Drive sends when a person shares a document. It is not clear if any accounts belonging to government officials were compromised, but information technology staff in at least one Senate office warned political staff about the phishing attempt, CBS News has confirmed. Many of the emails include the address in “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com” in the “send to” section. This email about a Google Doc appears to be from someone the user knows but is actually a phishing attempt. (Credit: CBS News) Many people who received the suspect invitations took to Twitter to warn others.   🚨 If someone you know seems to be very eager to share a Google Doc with you today, it might be a phishing attempt.

Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 If users click on the fraudulent link, they are brought to a Google page where they are asked to grant “Google Docs” access to all of their Google accounts — giving hackers an open door to their email and private documents. It is not clear who is behind the phishing effort. The phishing attempt spread across the internet for several hours before Google appeared to at least block the page allowing users to give data permissions. Google said in a statement sent to CBS News that by late Wednesday afternoon it had disabled accounts associated with the phishing attempt. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” the company said. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.” In an earlier tweet, Google warned users not to click suspect links. We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs.

Waymo, formerly Google’s “self-driving car” company, is suing Uber for using technology stolen by former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski. It’s asked the judge to put a halt on Uber’s self-driving R&D until the case is settled. Uber is free to continue working on its self-driving cars for the moment, while federal judge William Alsup wrangles with a lack of evidence, either damning Uber or vindicating it. Levandowski left Waymo in January 2016 to start autonomous truck company Otto, which Uber bought for $680 million in August 2016. Waymo claims he absconded with 14,000 top secret documents, an allegation that Judge Alsup said was not in question. Waymo believes Uber used details about its LiDAR technology, which uses lasers and radar to collect information about the surrounding environment. It’s not just accusing Uber of using proprietary information. According to Waymo, Uber collaborated with Levandowski while he was still at Google. As part of the plan, Waymo’s attorney’s say Levandowski left Waymo specifically to build an independent company using the stolen technical information that Uber could then buy. “There’s this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal,” said Waymo council Charles Verhoeven in court Wednesday. Waymo pointed to documents that show Levandowski received 5 million Uber shares on January 28, 2016, the day after he quit Google without notice. An Uber spokesperson said the shares were actually granted in August 2016 when the deal closed. Backdating gives Levandowski credit for the time he was at Otto. Because his vesting is tied to meeting certain milestones, he actually has zero Uber shares that are vested at this time. However, Uber maintains it did not use any trade secrets from the documents in its own technology, and that no Uber employees even knew they existed until the lawsuit. Judge Alsup agreed it was not clear that Uber had used that information or had even known that Levandowski possessed it. That made Alsup wary of issuing an injunction. “You didn’t sue him. You sued Uber. So what if it turns out Uber was totally innocent?,” Alsup asked Verhoeven. “Let’s say they are totally innocent and the worst thing they did was pay a lot of money to hire away a brilliant guy from another competitor?” Levandowski refused to answer questions during his deposition, taking the fifth amendment. Last week, Uber said Levandowski would step down as head of the self-driving team until the suit was settled. Uber is refusing to turn over 3,500 documents, claiming they contain privileged information about the Otto acquisition. However, its defense team tried to downplay the amount by showing how many documents and data they had provided. Lawyers and researchers collected over 229 terabytes of data, reviewed more than 300,000 documents, interviewed 85 employees and imaged the workstations of 131 workers, according to Uber. They only found one Google email, and it was unrelated to the case. Judge Alsup said that didn’t prove the stolen information wasn’t used, as Levandowski could have brought his own personal laptop into the office and worked off that. More depositions might be required to rule out similar scenarios. That could mean an assistant who saw Levandowski use the documents or even CEO Travis Kalanick. “We’ll produce our CEO for deposition,” said Gonzalez. “Nobody’s hiding at Uber.” Judge Alsup is expected to rule on the injunction this week, or he could ask Waymo to provide more evidence first.

Ron Amadeo - May 3, 2017 11:13 pm UTC reader comments 64 Share this story Here's an example of the e-mail that went out. It uses the same button and wording as a real Google Docs e-mail. When you click on it, you get a real Google login page from Google's servers. Then you get a real OAuth permissions page, also from Google's servers. The fake thing here is the app. It's a third-party app named "Google Docs" with the Google Docs icon as its profile picture. It wants full control over your e-mail. Real, verifiable info is only shown when you click on the drop down. Who is "eugene.pupov@gmail.com"? He's not Google! Google has since shut down the OAuth link. An evil phishing worm masquerading as "Google Docs" took the Internet by storm today. It sent an e-mail claiming to be from a friend or relative who wanted to share a document with you. Clicking on the "Open in Docs" button asked you to log in to Google, then it popped up a familiar OAuth request asking for some permissions. If you clicked "Allow," the permissions granted it full control over your e-mail and access to all your contacts. The worm then e-mailed everyone in your contacts list before doing god-only-knows what else to the victim's e-mail. The interesting thing about this worm was just how convincing it was. The e-mail was great—it used the exact same language as a Google Docs sharing e-mail and the exact same "Open" button. Clicking on the link brought up an authentic Google log-in page, served up from Google's servers. Then you were presented a real Google OAuth permissions page, also from Google's servers. The trick was that the app claiming to be "Google Docs" wasn't really Google Docs. The screen showed a third-party app with the name "Google Docs" and a profile picture that matched the Google Docs logo. Further ReadingAll your Googles are belong to us: Look out for the Google Docs phishing wormThe only way to tell the whole thing was a scam was to click the down arrow next to the "Google Docs" name. This showed you the developer info, which, rather than Google, was a random person with the e-mail "eugene.pupov@gmail.com." Genuine Google apps use OAuth all the time, but if you open the developer info you'll see something with an "@google.com" e-mail. Also, rather than redirecting you to a Google page, the phish tried to load a few different "Google sounding" URLs, in this case "googledoc.g-docs.pro." The downside (or upside?) to having a worm so closely tied to Google's infrastructure is that Google has some control over it. The company shut down the OAuth request and redirected users to an error page. Google also auto-revoked the permissions from everyone's account. For a time, the worm had total access to the victim's e-mail, so, in addition to spamming all your contacts, it could have copied all your e-mails (and all your Hangouts chats) to a third-party server. In the future, this method could be used for more phishing attempts, since the nefarious party knows your e-mail and product combinations. It could also be used for a public dump of VIP e-mails, like what happened to the DNC. Google issued a statement on the phishing attempt, saying: We have taken action to protect users against an e-mail impersonating Google Docs & have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages [and] pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing e-mails in Gmail. In the future, I think we'll need to see a redesign of how Google's OAuth pages work. The problem is that the true entity to which you're granting permissions in Google's OAuth interface is buried under a drop-down window. Right now, the interface really relies on the app developer not lying about its name and app logo, and that's just not good enough.

Users received an email that appeared to come from a contact in the users’ email accounts, inviting them to share a document, USA Today reports. The email looks similar to one sent by Google, but appears to come from an individual Gmail account. Here’s how you tell the difference: A reliable Google Doc invites you to edit a document, and has the blue Google Docs logo next to the doc name. The bogus email that went out Wednesday doesn't state the name of the doc, nor have its name, according to USA Today. When users click on the file, the fake Google Docs will seek permission to access your account. From there, the hacker could gain personal information and login credentials. Google released a statement Wednesday that said, "We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." +3  U.S. Air Force Airman Andrew J. Fuentes has graduated from basic military training at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in San Antonio, Texas. Courtesy of Joint Hometown News Service 2 U.S. Air Force Airman Andrew J. Fuentes has graduated from basic military training at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in San Antonio, Texas. According to Joint Hometown News Service, the airman completed an intensive, eight-week program that included training in military discipline and studies, Air Force core values, physical fitness, and basic warfare principles and skills. Fuentes, the son of Francisca and Jesus Fuentes and husband of Bryna Fuentes, graduated from Highland High School in 2010. 3 That 11-hour flight between Tokyo and L.A. can be boring. So a couple of fliers thought staging a mini-fight club was a good way to pass the time. One man got up and started throwing punches at a man seated behind him. "No one provoked him — he was cool up until a few minutes before he started hitting the guy," passenger Corey Hour, who videotaped the confrontation, told CNN. "He started verbally abusing and intimidating people. Nothing triggered him, it just happened." Before Hour started recording the fight, he said he heard the man who started the fight tell the other man, “Where are you from?” and “I am going to kill you.” Shortly after things escalated, the crew was able to calm the situation.  Hour praised the flight crew's response on Twitter: "For the record ANA staff and passengers handled the situation with grace and respect. They did the best they could to diffuse the situation." Hour told CNN the man was then escorted off the aircraft, causing more than a 90-minute delay. An airport police official from Narita, the airport in Tokyo, told CNN a "drunk" passenger was arrested at the airport Monday but did not confirm the arrest was related to this incident. +3  This April 29, 2017, photo provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows a hearse, the casket and the bricks of marijuana it was carrying after agents stopped the vehicle at an immigration checkpoint on State Route 80 near Tombstone, Ariz. The 67 pounds (30 kilograms) of marijuana were found inside the coffin, Border Patrol officials said Monday, May 1, 2017. Drug-smelling dogs alerted agents.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection via AP 4 Ways of smuggling drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border keep getting more and more crafty. Here’s the latest attempt: An American man — a very bad hombre — was arrested over the weekend after allegedly trying to smuggle 67 pounds of pot across the Mexican border in a coffin in a hearse, CNN reports. We have to give this guy an “A” for effort. He probably didn’t think someone would have the guts to ask him to disturb the dead and open the casket. But he was wrong. CNN says the 28-year-old male driver is behind bars facing charges of narcotics smuggling. We are still left wondering how does one get his or her hands on a hearse? Is there a Craigslist tab for that? +3  In this June 28, 2015, file photo, Janet Jackson accepts the ultimate icon: music dance visual award at the BET Awards in Los Angeles.

The diva on Twitter Monday night made several big announcements about her family and her return to the stage, CNN reports. Jackson started the video by addressing her weight gain, but quickly moved on to gush about her 3-month-old son, Eissa Al Mana, whose picture she recently shared on social media. "Hey you guys, it's me Jan, just in case you didn't recognize me cause I have put on quite a few since I had the baby," Jackson said. "I thank God for him, you guys. He's so healthy, so beautiful, so sweet, so loving, such a happy baby." She also talked about her separation from her husband, Wissam Al Mana, saying she wanted to "keep it real" with her fans. Lastly, she announced that she would be resuming her "Unbreakable" tour, which she has renamed the "State of the World" tour. The tour is scheduled to resume beginning with a concert Sept. 7 in Lafayette, La.. Tickets go on sale May 5. Jackson postponed her tour first in 2015. 6 President Donald Trump declined an invitation to return to “Saturday Night Live” this season, according to Alec Baldwin. Baldwin was on Wednesday’s Ellen DeGeneres daytime talk show, and said that Trump was asked to appear on the Feb. 11 episode that Baldwin hosted, Variety reports. “When we did the show, when I hosted ‘SNL’ this season, we asked him to come,” Baldwin told DeGeneres. “We invited him to come, we were so hopeful he would come, but he didn’t show up.” NBC declined to comment about Baldwin’s claim. According to Variety, when Trump hosted the show as a presidential candidate in 2015, “Saturday Night Live” drew 9.3 million total viewers, delivering what was at the time the most watched episode of the show since 2013. 7 After finding out actor Liam Neeson was going to be in the Vancouver area, a local sandwich shop tried to get his attention. According to BuzzFeed, employees at Big Star Sandwich in New Westminster had heard a rumor that Neeson was in the area filming the movie "Hard Powder," coming out in 2018. So, the staff decided to put a message on the sandwich board outside offering him a free meal. The side read, "Liam Neeson eats here for free" and "Come in and get Taken away by our sandwiches." Alex Johrden, Big Star's director of operations, told BuzzFeed Canada that staff put the sign out in the morning, and Neeson showed up that afternoon. Johrden said the two employees, Kyle Gus and Serge Patoka, were totally surprised when he walked through the door. "We had no idea he would be in our vicinity," Johrden said. "I assume someone on the film crew saw the sign and got it back to him." 8 There’s a new bolt from the sky that may be a new part of the northern lights. So of course, scientists gave it an out-of-this-world name: Steve. Steve is the newly discovered celestial phenomenon that may or may not be related to the aurora or northern lights. Eric Donovan, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Calgary, has been studying Steve. Donovan doesn't believe that Steve is an aurora, but he knows it is a narrow channel of ionized gas caused by dynamics in the Earth's magnetosphere. While Steve is a relatively new find, Donovan believes the phenomenon occurs about three times a month, CNN says. According to Canadian Geographic, Chris Ratzlaff, the first person to see the atmospheric phenomenon, came up with the name Steve from the animated movie "Over the Hedge." In the movie, a group of animals is scared of something unknown, but it decides that it will be far less scary if it has a name. +3  In this April 18, 2017, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at his company's annual F8 developer conference in San Jose, Calif.  (AP Photo/Noah Berger, File) 9 Facebook plans to hire 3,000 people to join its 4,500-member community operations team in an effort to screen and combat harmful content on the social media site, The Huffington Post reports. CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement on his Facebook page Wednesday, pledging that the new hires will help the company “get better at removing things we don’t allow on Facebook like hate speech and child exploitation.” Zuckerberg also said the company will simplify the process for users flagging questionable content for review, and will make it easier for employees to contact law enforcement when necessary, The Post says. 10 American Airlines flights just got a little more uncomfortable by it adding more seats to some of its planes. Of course this results in reduced legroom. CNN says three rows will lose two inches — from 31 to 29 inches — and the rest of the economy cabin will have 30 inches of legroom. This pushes American closer to budget airlines like Spirit, which provides only 28 inches of legroom. United Airlines is also considering a similar move, according to a person briefed on its evaluations. United declined to comment. The move signals a new step in the shrinking of U.S. airline cabins, and comes even as carriers are promising to improve overall customer service, CNN reports. By comparison, economy class space on Delta Air Lines and United ranges from 30 to 31 inches, while JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines have between 31 and 33 inches. According to CNN, fliers will still pay regular economy fares for the 18 seats with two inches less legroom.

The car is planned for sale in 2021. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 3, 2017 at 3:37 pm | UPDATED: May 3, 2017 at 3:46 pm SAN JOSE — Semiconductor titan Intel has officially jumped into the self-driving car frenzy, throwing itself into battle with Google spinoff Waymo, Apple and a host of other firms. “That is an arms race going on,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University focused on autonomous driving. “I don’t think they are late, but they have to execute, of course.” In an event for press and analysts Wednesday at its “Innovation Campus” in San Jose, Intel unveiled a sleek silver BMW sedan showcasing Intel’s partnership with the German automaker and the computer vision company Mobileye that Intel is buying. The partnership is intended to let Intel develop a “base functionality platform” for self-driving cars that it would license to car makers, said Intel spokeswoman Marcie Miller. The Santa Clara firm’s move comes as its business has been on the upswing after it missed the mobile-computing revolution and saw PC sales falter before it pivoted toward cloud computing and development of 5G wireless networks. Autonomous cars represent another new frontier in technology markets. “It’s very wise for them to diversify,” Rajkumar said. Intel’s semiconductor chips would act as the “brains” for an autonomous-driving system, Miller said. The chips would process data from vehicles’ sensors within the vehicle, as well as in Intel’s self-driving system, and for processing autonomous-vehicle data in the cloud, Miller said. The foray into autonomous driving will leverage and bolster Intel’s strengths, including its data centers, its work on 5G networks, and its processors, said Kathy Winter, vice-president of the firm’s Automated Driving Group. “It plays well to all of the things that we are already doing, and it’s another way to extend those businesses,” Winter said. Or, as AutoPacific analyst George Peterson said, “it’s a way to sell chips.” Intel’s gambit puts it up against companies from a variety of technology sector, analysts said. “One of their primary competitors is going to be Waymo, of course, they’re well ahead,” Peterson said. Another rival will be Apple, which probably won’t build a car but instead produce autonomous-driving software and possibly some hardware modules, Peterson said. In an additional arena of competition, Intel will do battle with companies like Bosch making components for self-driving systems, and in yet another competitive realm, Intel will strive against companies with expertise in mapping  — including Google, Magellan and TomTom — that’s crucial to autonomous driving systems, Peterson said. Car makers like Ford and GM also represent competition for Intel’s self-driving efforts, along with Uber, which is testing autonomous vehicles, and smaller firms such as Aurora Innovation, co-founded by Google’s former self-driving project head Chris Urmson, Rajkumar said. Another chipmaker, Santa Clara’s NVIDIA, will put additional competitive pressure on Intel, via NVIDIA processors used within autonomous cars — including all Teslas sold in the last six months — and for processing self-driving vehicle data in the cloud, said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. Whether a dominant autonomous-driving player will emerge with a widely used platform, or whether car makers will pull technology from a variety of sources remains to be seen, Peterson said. The BMW 740i showcased Wednesday is a prototype for the “iNext” electric car that BMW plans to put on the market in 2021, with self-driving capabilities falling somewhere between mostly driving itself but needing human backup, and full autonomy, said BMW advanced technology engineer Kyle Moy. Intel in November announced a partnership with Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye, and in March, it announced it was buying the company for about $15 billion. It is Mobileye’s machine-vision technology that will act as the “eyes” of the BMW prototype. Intel, by its own admission, missed the mobile revolution. And with the company netting more than half its sales from shipment of PCs as of 2016, five straight years of falling PC sales led Intel last year to announce it would cut 12,000 jobs and focus on chips for the cloud and Internet-connected devices. However, Intel’s fortunes have swung upward of late, with CEO Brian Krzanich in the company’s latest earnings report highlighting record first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, and looking toward self-driving car technology.   Tags:  Apple Autos Google Intel Self-driving cars Technology Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

Google releases official statement on widespread Google Docs phishing email Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 3:05pm PDTMay 3, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 89 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Google News Phishing emails are annoying and potentially dangerous, but very rarely do we see one as nefarious as this. A specific email, shown above, has been making waves in the news and Google has released an official statement regarding it. First, you may be wondering why this specific message is worth talking about. First, it looks identical to normal Google Docs invitation emails. When the 'Open in Docs' link is clicked, the user is asked to give "Google Docs" access to their Google account. Essentially, someone made a web app that identifies itself as Google Docs, easily tricking anyone not paying close attention. @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Not too long ago, the official Twitter account for Gmail sent the below tweet: We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail. — Gmail (@gmail) May 3, 2017 Shortly afterwards, the Google Docs account tweeted an official statement from the company: (1 of 3) Official Google Statement on Phishing Email: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs... — Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 (2 of 3) & have disabled offending accounts.

We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. — Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 So there you have it - Google has mostly rectified the problem. If you see the phishing email, or something like it, be sure to report it so Google can more reliably block it. Let us know in the comments if you received the email.

Demitrius Harris I love my HTC One M8 for Windows but it overheats easily. Does the Android version overheat quickly when playing 3D games. Not the usual overheating but severe​ overheating, so much so that one time it overheated, melted the glue on that held the HTC letters and the letters fell off the back of the phone. True story. creep_the_night The Android version doesn't get quite that hot, but it does heat up pretty well. (At least I've never gotten it that hot) I also have a LG G3 VS985 that gets just as hot, if not hotter.(I've had the G3 actually shut down due to overheating) It's just the way the chipset is...

This isn't a screw up by Google, they fixed the problem right after they were notified. This is a triumph by Google, if anything. Martin How is this a Google screw up?

It's best not to click by Colin Dwyer | NPR Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook There's a decent chance you — or someone you know — just got an odd email inviting you to edit a document on Google Docs. The email could be from a stranger, a colleague or a friend, but it's addressed to a contact that boasts a whole string of H's in its name. In other words, it looks a little something like this: This is what the subject line may look like in the email, for people using Microsoft Outlook. The telltale sign something's amiss: that email address with that long line of H's. Screenshot by NPR Or, if you're looking at the invite in Gmail, it likely looks more like this: https://twitter.com/zachlatta/status/859843151757955072 Either of these look familiar to you? Here's a handy tip: Don't open the link. Trouble is, those invitations aren't what they seem. They are in fact malicious files intended to hijack recipients' accounts — and Google advises its users not to open them. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," a Google spokesperson says in a statement emailed to NPR. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing," the statement continues, "and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." https://twitter.com/gmail/status/859863893484593152 If this public service announcement has reached you too late and you're now staring in despair at an already opened link, Vice's Motherboard explains what to do next: "If you have clicked on the link, go to your Google account's page (https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) where you can manage the permissions you've granted to apps (or go through the whole Google Security Checkup). Then locate the 'Google Doc' app. This looks totally legitimate, but it's actually not. If that's the malicious app that's gotten access to your account after you clicked on the link it should have a recent 'Authorization Time.' Now, click on that Google Docs app and click 'Remove.' " https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/859856662835941376 And, in case it helps, know at least that you're not alone. Many people — especially journalists — reported receiving these invites Wednesday afternoon. Enough people, in fact, that the hashtag #PhishingScam began trending on Twitter and email inboxes clogged with nearly as many warnings about the scam as instances of the scam itself. https://twitter.com/ibalkhy/status/859844591553581056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Fsections%2Fthetwo-way%2F2017%2F05%2F03%2F526785635%2Fdid-you-get-a-weird-invitation-to-edit-a-google-doc-its-best-not-to-click So, once you successfully delete that phishy email — or take steps to remove its gnarled claws from your hapless inbox — you can take comfort in the fact that, no matter what ails you, Twitter has some snark to cure it. https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/859847909445074946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Fsections%2Fthetwo-way%2F2017%2F05%2F03%2F526785635%2Fdid-you-get-a-weird-invitation-to-edit-a-google-doc-its-best-not-to-click Copyright 2017 NPR.

The sophisticated attack looks like it is coming from a trusted source asking you to open a Google Document. If you click, it takes you to a page to open the “Google Docs” app with your Google account. This grants access to your email account and contacts. Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says anyone who clicked on the link should check their Google App permissions and remove the one called “Google Docs.” You can do that by clicking this link. It’s unclear how widespread the attack is, but reporters at publications including BuzzFeed, CNN, and Motherboard tweeted that they’d receiving the phishing email, as had many of their sources. On Wednesday afternoon, “Google Docs” was a global trending topic on Twitter, meaning a lot of people were talking about the attacks. It’s not clear who is behind the phishing attempts. This attack can spread quickly — the fake Google Docs app can read your contacts and send more phishing attempts to your contacts. A phishing attack is a popular method of stealing credentials and hacking into people’s emails, bank accounts or other private accounts. A hacker poses as a trusted source and sends you a malicious link. Experts say the phish was convincing and sophisticated. Here’s what happened: Hackers created a malicious app and named it “Google Docs,” which looked trustworthy. Google uses an authorization system called OAuth, which uses security tokens instead of passwords to connect your Google account with third party apps. Because the malicious app looked legit, it essentially tricked users into trusting it with their security token — which is all that was needed to access the accounts. This is a popular phishing method — security firm Trend Micro reported earlier this year that Russian hackers were using it. “As we have seen repeatedly, these kinds of schemes are usually the precursor to larger nefarious activities, like money transfers, planting ransomware, etc.,” said Frances Zelazny, VP of cybersecurity startup BioCatch. Google said it is investigating the phishing scam. The company advises people not to click on the link and report any phishing attempts to the company. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” Google said in a statement. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” … the real way to address the hacks is to change the way we think about data security.

Google appeared to have shut down the phishing campaign within about an hour. Illustration: Tom's GuideMore Illustration: Tom's Guide The phishing email arrived in your inbox and said that someone you knew had shared a Google Doc with you. There was a button to "Open in Docs" — if you clicked it, you were redirected to a non-Google address, and everyone in your Google address book then got the same phishing email, only with you as the sender. "I just got a Google Doc invite from a BuzzFeed email address, clicked on it, and it spammed everyone I've ever emailed," tweeted Joe Bernstein, a BuzzFeed technology reporter. MORE: Best Antivirus Protection for PC, Mac and Android It's not yet clear what the aim of the phishing scam was. A posting on the official G Suite blog said that "the problem with Google Drive should be resolved." If you received such an email and clicked on the"Open in Docs" button, go to https://myaccount.google.com/permissions and see if "Google Docs" is listed as one of the apps that has access to your Google account. If so, that's the fake one — the real Google Docs shouldn't appear on this page. Select the fake Google Docs and click the blue "REMOVE" button. (We originally advised changing your Google password, but that doesn't seem to have been necessary.) The Google Doc scam email, as received by a Tom's Guide staffer.More The Google Doc scam email, as received by a Tom's Guide staffer. "This big phishing attack is clever; an OAUTH based attack. Tricks you into giving 'permission' to read your emails," tweeted Matt Tait, a British security expert. 0Auth is a widely used credentialing standard that keeps you logged into accounts for a long period of time, and can also be used across accounts. For example, when you log into Gmail on one Chrome tab, then open another tab to open Google Drive, a 0Auth "token" logs you into the second tab's content automatically. Likewise, if you keep a browser logged into a Twitter account indefinitely, that's OAuth at work. Malicious hackers love stealing 0Auth tokens because they can be reused until the user completely logs out of an account on all devices. Read More Tait added that the ongoing attack was very similar to a spear-phishing campaign last year carried out by APT28, aka Pawn Storm or Fancy Bear, and documented by the Tokyo-based security firm Trend Micro in a recent report. APT28 is one of the two Russian groups that hacked into the Democratic National Committee's email servers during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. However, the source code for today's attack was quickly found on at least two code-sharing websites. Its availability indicated that this email virus may have been the work of "script kiddies," or juvenile pranksters, rather than cybercriminals or nation-state-backed hackers.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo By Jim Finkle and Alastair Sharp Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs after a large number of people turned to social media to complain that their accounts had been hacked. Google said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. "This is the future of phishing," said Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc. "It gets attackers to their goal ... without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device." He said the hackers had also pointed some users to another site, since taken down, that sought to capture their passwords. Google said its abuse team "is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again." Anybody who granted access to the malicious app unknowingly also gave hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. "This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party," said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.

Did you click on an unsolicited Google Docs email invite today? It might have been a scam. According to Vice's Motherboard, online miscreants on Wednesday launched a "massive phishing campaign targeting Google accounts." The "highly sophisticated" campaign appears to have hit a number of journalists, along with individuals from other industries, the report notes. The fraudulent emails include what appears to be a Google Doc link from someone the recipient knows. "These, however, are malicious emails designed to steal your Google password or hijack your account," Motherboard advises. Reddit user JakeSteam, who received the phishing email, said clicking the purported Google Docs button in the message takes you to an actual Google page, which asks you to grant access to an app masquerading as Google Docs. Granting permission would give the attacker full access to your email messages and contacts. The email then replicates itself and spreads to "everyone you have ever emailed," according to JakeSteam. @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Affected individuals who clicked "allow" should revoke access to the fake Google Docs app right away, JakeSteam recommends. Related Google Drive Tips You Can't Afford to Miss Google Drive Tips You Can't Afford to Miss The attack can bypass two-factor authentication, so having that additional layer of security enabled won't help you. Note that it's still a good idea to have two-factor authentication enabled, as it makes your account much harder to crack. Google did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. But in a statement posted to the @GoogleDocs Twitter account, the company said "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs [and] have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." This phishing campaign comes after attackers in January targeted Gmail users with a sophisticated ploy designed to steal usernames and passwords.

Chrome Dev 58 seemingly removes option to disable New Tab page recommendations Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/02/07 1:08pm PDTFeb 7, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares86 Applications Google News Until Chrome 54, the New Tab page only showed a grid of commonly-visited pages and quick shortcuts to Bookmarks and Recent tabs. Then the shortcuts were removed, and replaced with a list of recommended articles (much like Google Now/Google Feed). I wasn't a fan of the change, and the comments on that post indicated many of you were not either. Perhaps Google heard the complaints, because the recent Chrome 56 update made the screen more useful by adding lists of recently-added bookmarks and tabs to the page. Still, for those of us who hate change, going back to the old design was as easy as changing two flags in Chrome settings. Unfortunately, one of the flags that must be disabled for that to work (#enable-ntp-snippets) has vanished from Chrome Dev 58. Disabling all other flags related to the New Tab page only seems to turn off the added features from Chrome 56 - the recommended articles remain. It's not guaranteed that the flag won't come back, or be changed to something else - this is the Dev branch, and features change constantly. We'll keep an eye out for any changes as Chrome 58 moves to Beta. Tags chrome chrome 58 chrome dev flag subscribe ...

Ezhik Chrome user switcher all over again. The flag won't come back. Branko What the fuck Google. Well regarding how they force the crap called AMP I'm not surprised. Andrew Wang I actually like AMP (I use Sprint) Romek Nowak You know, that actually works. Not to mention that it saves battery and data. I can browse Google+ on EDGE and not worry about not being able to quickly open a link ~50% of the time. Branko You know, that actually breaks the whole premise of what Internet is and how Google as Search market monopolist should behave. If I want to open an URL, I want that to open, not some JS crapfest of buttons on $searchcompanys CDN. And before you say it's opt-in by publishers - yeah, they do it because they don't want to loose SEO rankings mandated by the maker of AMP and Search monopolist. Sounds like that business with selling "protection". If they want to get serious, make it possible to opt-out in Google Search settings. Romek Nowak You're right. They should allow people to opt out. Lord Argyris *sigh* It's sad how I'm not even surprised by this anymore. This is just how Google treats its users these days. A list of (often clickbaity) articles on the New Tab screen is not going to win any users over from iOS. It's not going to make anybody's Chrome experience measurably better. Nobody is going to see this feature and exclaim, "Wow! This is so much better than what we had before! This is just what Chrome needed!" At best, the vast majority of average Android users, who--and this must be stressed--don't care about this stuff, will just shrug and carry on with their day. They weren't asking for this change, and it won't even register on their radar, aside from maybe the fleeing moment when they notice the change (if they even notice at all). All it can do is piss off people who liked the functionality as it existed before--people who otherwise would not be pissed off, especially now that it looks like the flag that reverts the behavior has been stripped. These people will not be compensated for by an equal or greater number of people who react positively, because nobody apart from those who don't like the change will care either way. This all can therefore only be a net negative. I'm all for taking chances on new ideas, especially if there's a clear advantage to the new way. Inevitably these kinds of major changes are going to upset some people. That's the price of progress. But that's not what Google has been doing the past year or so with Chrome. They've just been swapping stuff out with no apparent regard for whether or not anybody wanted the change and replacing it with features of debatable value (or, in the case of tabs as apps, with nothing at all). There's nothing groundbreaking about any of it. It's just feature churn and change for the sake of change. Robin Jorgenson Really? I mean do you actually scroll through your bookmarks more than handful of times a year? I just type a couple letters where I'm going and boom. I like how on the ok google page all you have to do is flip you r thumb up and wa-lla there is all your updates including recent activity. Change is good because it allows you to find new and innovative ways of adapting. If nothing ever changes we wouldn't be where we are today with technology. Embrace change, innovate, and experiment into new dimensions. Peace, A googlr Matthias I'd be ok with the change, IF there still was a quick and easy way to reach my recently opened tabs (on the phone and synced from my computer)... But apparently there isn't... Why they would hide or even remove this feature is beyond me :( Richard Riker ...tap on the three dots in the upper right corner and then on recent tabs? Where is the problem? Matthias That they are hiding one of my most used features in an overflow menu, and that they remove the option to change this. I admit it's nothing I couldnt get used to, but it's still such a pointless change. Why remove existing functionality? Everything was working perfectly fine. As if some setting hidden in chrome:flags could confuse new users or anything... Richard Riker guys, there is something called feedback function. If enough are complaining (and giving good reasons instead of just bashing like here) the chance is higher they will overthink their decisions Fluffy Bunny I want easy access to my favorites, not their promoted articles. Khirina Kha Pisses me off. I want my convenient bookmarks and recent tabs buttons back.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Gadgets Seven reasons your business should be on YouTube Published May 4, 2017May 4, 2017 Share Tweet Share Pin it +1 Ozioma Ubabukoh A report by Google recently stated that YouTube is going to be a dramatically more important piece of marketing mix in the future. Over 69 per cent of marketers plan on increasing their use of YouTube. Many say it will be the single biggest area of focus in 2017 and Google several years ago set up the YouTube spaces in London, Berlin, New York, Paris, Toronto, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Mumbai. The Director, Europe, Middle East and Africa, YouTube, Ben McOwen Wilson, said, “We have plans to take the YouTube spaces to Lagos in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya.” Just because every marketer is using a particular tool does not always mean you should be using it too – just saying. However, it may be a clue that it is worth checking that tool out to see if it makes sense for marketing your business. Also, as a rule of thumb, if your competitors are using a particular tool well, it is even more important to check it out! What may be a reason your business should be using YouTube? Check out these seven reasons why using video marketing on YouTube may be the right choice to help you build your brand. It’s in the numbers Just because everyone is using it does not necessarily mean you should. That said, the fact is that there are a lot of people and lots of videos there. With over two million videos watched each day, it makes sense to market using videos. So, you need to be on YouTube. It’s where your customers want to find you Let’s face it, when it comes to explaining something, the way you naturally speak is almost always better than trying to write it out. Your customers know this too, and when they want to have something explained to them, YouTube is where they go to learn. It’s the second largest search engine Surprised? Maybe you thought it would be Yahoo or Bing! The fact is that YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google. So, having content here that is optimised to be found by someone looking for your product, service, or niche just makes sense! It’s owned by Google We know this can get confusing, but bear with us, okay? When it comes to boosting your Search Engine Optimisation, Google properties are a good bet. Make sure to fill-out your profile completely and please do not forget adding the URL for your website. Label your videos appropriately and include relevant terms for your niche. This will continue to boost your authority in the eyes of Google, and you’ll gain SEO juice from it. Embedding One of the best things about YouTube videos is how many different places you can embed them and how easy it is. You can embed videos in your blog and on your social media platforms. It is just way too easy to share your valuable content with your audience! Easy to make YouTube videos are easy to make. No special equipment is needed! As you get more involved in this aspect of marketing, you can choose to purchase a few pieces of equipment to make it easier. However, just starting out, you really can get away with the camera on your iPhone or your webcam on your laptop! People will forgive you if your visuals aren’t perfect, but the one thing they won’t struggle through is poor quality audio. If you can pick up an inexpensive microphone to make your audio recording clearer, you will be ahead of many other marketers on YouTube. YouTube can make the interaction between the buyer and seller more real Video can make the interaction between the buyer and seller more real by letting the seller demonstrate a product or service in a very realistic way. For brands that exist only online, YouTube marketing creates a way to do total lifestyle marketing unlike any other medium. NOTE: ModCloth is one retailer that has made great use of YouTube. A vintage clothing store without a retail location, ModCloth’s YouTube channel surrounds its customers with the experience of the brand in a virtual way, much like the experience of walking into a brick and mortar store may do so.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Alphabet Inc warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs after a large number of people turned to social media to complain that their accounts had been hacked. Google said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. “Our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again,” the company said in an email to Reuters. The malicious emails asked victims to click to view a file created with Google Docs. Anybody who did that unknowingly granted hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. “This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,” said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk May 3, 2017, 6:50pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Max Jeffrey A federal judge is weighing Waymo’s request to prevent Uber from using self-driving vehicle technology the Google spinoff claims was stolen by a rogue ex-employee, according to multiple reports. The ruling in favor of the injunction could undermine Uber’s ability to operate its fleet of autonomous cars on public roads in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz. It’s the next hotly closely watched case that pits two of Silicon Valley’s biggest players head-to-head. US District Court Judge William Alsup appears to be leaning against granting Waymo’s request for an injunction, but he has yet to issue a ruling. According to Reuters, Alsup chided Waymo for not producing a “smoking gun” in its case against Uber. Waymo filed the explosive lawsuit in late February, claiming that Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer and current vice president at Uber, had stolen 14,000 confidential documents — or 9.7 gigabytes of data — before leaving Google. In the suit, Waymo accuses Uber of stealing its trade secrets and infringing on its patents, including Waym’s proprietary LIDAR system. According to Waymo, Levandowski used the stolen technology to entice Uber into buying his self-driving truck startup Otto for $680 million six months after it launched in 2016. Uber called the allegation “baseless,” but recently was forced to admit that Google’s self-driving technology was superior to its own. (Levandowski recently stepped aside as head of Uber’s self-driving car unit.) The upshot here: Waymo claims Otto was a ruse to acquire Levandowski's tech/talent, and deal was negotiated while he still worked for Goog.— ಠ_ಠ (@MikeIsaac) May 3, 2017 Today, Waymo’s lawyers took that argument one step further, basically calling Otto a shell company used by Levandowski to give Uber an unfair advantage in the competitive field of self-driving cars. Waymo claims that the deal for Uber to purchase Otto was negotiated while Levandowski was still employed at Google. The company’s lawyers produced documents showing Levandowski was promised 5 million shares in Uber, vesting January 28th, 2016. That amounts to around $250 million in stock, Waymo’s lawyers said. (An Uber spokesperson told reporters at the hearing that those shares were backdated after the acquisition to begin vesting.) Waymo says Uber gave Levandowksi 5 million shares — valued at $250M— the day after he left Google.— Biz Carson (@bizcarson) May 3, 2017 US District Court Judge William Alsup, who famously learned to code in Java for a case involving Google and Oracle, closely examined Uber’s “Spider” laser radar system (aka LIDAR) that Waymo says closely resembles its own. Uber's lawyers show off "Spider", the lidar project Waymo now says mirrors their own— Aarian Marshall (@AarianMarshall) May 3, 2017 Levandowski recently invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, against the advice of Uber’s lawyers. A redaction mistake in a recent filing revealed that Lior Ron, Levandowski’s co-founder in Otto, has also been implicated in the lawsuit. Ultimately, Uber wants to move the case into arbitration, arguing that since Waymo’s case centers on the action of Levandowski, a former employee, it should be subject to the arbitration agreement as part of his employee contract. The move is also strategic, as it would allow Uber to avoid a costly and embarrassing jury trial. That trial is tentatively scheduled to commence this October. The allegations put forward by Waymo arguably represent the biggest threat to Uber’s long-term financial survival — more so than the harassment scandal or any of the other controversies that have enveloped the company in recent months. If Uber can eventually transition to a majority driverless fleet, it can slash fares for customers, drive up demand, and increase its own profits. But if Waymo can prove that Uber is using stolen technology, that future could be imperiled. And Uber’s ability to justify its huge $70 billion valuation could take a serious hit.

St George News 68 93/61 Fri 95/66 Sat 88/56 Experts urge Gmail users to beware of Google Docs phishing attack Written by Kimberly Scott May 3, 2017 Stock image | St. George News ST. GEORGE — A new and sophisticated phishing attack swiftly spread across the web Wednesday and into the inboxes of Gmail account users. Google said it is investigating the phishing scam and encouraged people not to click on the link. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” Google said in a statement. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” A phishing attack is a popular method of stealing credentials and hacking into people’s emails, bank accounts or other private accounts. A hacker poses as a trusted source and sends users a malicious link. Wednesday’s sophisticated attack showed up in a convincing email appearing as though it was from a trusted source asking users to open a Google Document. Users who clicked the link were taken to a page to open the “Google Docs” app with their Google account subsequently granting phishers full access to the user’s email account and contacts. Anyone who opened the email and clicked on the link should check their Google App permissions by clicking here, and delete the one called “Google Docs.” The phishing attempt made its way across the internet for several hours Wednesday before Google blocked the page allowing users to give data permissions.

After the masses took to Twitter starting around 3 p.m., Alphabet Inc. warned its users to beware of emails from known contacts asking them to click on a link to Google Docs. In the email, users are asked to click on a link to view a document, which provides the hackers access to the contents of their Google accounts, including email, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. Even the Google Doc Twitter account sent out a warning: "We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail." Early on, many Twitter users simply offered warnings or advice on what to do if you already clicked on the Google Doc. About three hours after the first tweets came in, "Google Doc" was the second top trending item in the country. If you get a “Google Docs” shared document today, don’t click it. It got past spam filters and a lot of people are falling for it right now.— Adam Steinbaugh (@adamsteinbaugh) May 3, 2017 DO NOT click on the google docs links you are getting in gmail within the last 10 minutes. They are phishing emails.— Lugnut (@WhippleLugnut) May 3, 2017 But despite the seriousness of the scam, it didn't take long for the Twitter comedians to come out of the woodwork. From jokes about not being included to remembering to tell mom and dad, the Twitterverse just couldn't help but to show its witty side. "You know you're unimportant when you don't get the Google Docs phishing scam in your inbox. [😔]" tweeted Brett. "I didn't know a Nigerian Prince ran 'Google Docs,' " joked Chris Dmytriw‏. Scroll down to see some of the highlights. Step 1: Be aware of the Google Docs email scam. Step 2: Don’t fall for it. Step 3: Make a joke about it. https://t.co/HV9SMdohjv— Twitter Moments (@TwitterMoments) May 3, 2017 "Google HR has sent you a job offer in Google Docs."

By Kim LaCapria May 3rd, 2017 251 On 3 May 2017, reports of Google Docs phishing attacks surfaced. Initial stories suggested that journalists were the primary target of the purported Google Docs vulnerability, but subsequently released information suggests that no particular group of users were at risk. Reports widely reference an origin e-mail address of “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com,” with others copied on the message. Vice was one of the first outlets to cover the rumors: A massive phishing campaign targeting Google accounts is ripping through the internet right now. Several journalists, as well as people working in other industries, have said they’ve received emails containing what looks like a link to a Google Doc that appears to come from someone they know. These, however, are malicious emails designed to hijack your account. At approximately 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time, GMail sent a tweet confirming they were investigating reports of a vulnerability and warned users to be on alert: We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail. — Gmail (@gmail) May 3, 2017 Zach Latta of HackClub.com tweeted a series of tips for users who believed they were infected by the phishing attack: How to fix fake Google Docs phish: 1. Go to https://t.co/60z1CDeunO 2. Find the app called “Google Docs” 3. Revoke all permissions — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Note: they may still have your info on their servers. Can’t do anything about that, but this prevents further use of your Google account. — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 I’m sending this to people that got phished. pic.twitter.com/3uP7NvQDkt — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Update: Google revoked the app, there’s nothing more to do. Attacker likely has victim info on their servers, but no more account control. — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Google has advised people with security concerns to review their Google permissions for unauthorized apps, including one called “Google Docs”.

(Source: Pixabay) (RNN) - Don't get hooked by a phishing attempt reeling in victims who open links to Google documents sent to their emails.   People on the internet are being tricked Wednesday by a sophisticated phishing scam designed to gain access to Google accounts.  Potential victims are receiving email links to what seem to be Google Docs from people they know. Clicking on the link within the email takes victims to a real Google page requesting permissions across the victims' Google accounts. Those who grant permission are giving attackers access to their personal data.  Some of the emails are addressed to "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailnator.com" and the target's name is in the BCC field.   Mailinator says the emails are not coming from it.  Thank you for all the reports. We're working on it. But remember, Mailinator can't send email. The phishing emails aren't coming from us.— Mailinator (@mailinator) May 3, 2017 Google is investigating the scam and advises people not to click on the email links. "We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail," Google tweeted.  We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail.— Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 Google issued a statement through Twitter, saying:  We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs ... & have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team ... is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.

The sophisticated attack looks like it is coming from a trusted source asking you to open a Google Document. If you click, it takes you to a page to open the “Google Docs” app with your Google account. This grants access to your email account and contacts. Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says anyone who clicked on the link should check their Google App permissions and remove the one called “Google Docs.” You can do that by clicking this link. It’s unclear how widespread the attack is, but reporters at publications including BuzzFeed, CNN, and Motherboard tweeted that they’d receiving the phishing email, as had many of their sources. On Wednesday afternoon, “Google Docs” was a global trending topic on Twitter, meaning a lot of people were talking about the attacks. It’s not clear who is behind the phishing attempts. This attack can spread quickly — the fake Google Docs app can read your contacts and send more phishing attempts to your contacts. A phishing attack is a popular method of stealing credentials and hacking into people’s emails, bank accounts or other private accounts. A hacker poses as a trusted source and sends you a malicious link. Experts say the phish was convincing and sophisticated. Here’s what happened: Hackers created a malicious app and named it “Google Docs,” which looked trustworthy. Google uses an authorization system called OAuth, which uses security tokens instead of passwords to connect your Google account with third party apps. Because the malicious app looked legit, it essentially tricked users into trusting it with their security token — which is all that was needed to access the accounts. This is a popular phishing method — security firm Trend Micro reported earlier this year that Russian hackers were using it. “As we have seen repeatedly, these kinds of schemes are usually the precursor to larger nefarious activities, like money transfers, planting ransomware, etc.,” said Frances Zelazny, VP of cybersecurity startup BioCatch. Google said it is investigating the phishing scam. The company advises people not to click on the link and report any phishing attempts to the company. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” Google said in a statement. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” … the real way to address the hacks is to change the way we think about data security.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) Print Email The Washington Post By The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on May 03, 2017 at 5:46 PM, updated May 03, 2017 at 5:49 PM comments If you've received an invitation to join a shared Google Doc that you weren't expecting, you might want to steer clear of it. It's probably a phishing scam that could compromise your account. Internet users everywhere are being spammed with what appear to be malicious invitations to log on to their Google accounts. Unlike your garden-variety cyberattack, many of the telltale signs that could tip you off that something is awry are absent. For example, the attack appears to work by tricking you into logging into your actual Google account, then granting a third party (your attacker) access to your account's data. Having gained permission to access your contacts, the attacker then fires off spam invites to everyone in your address book. What makes this attack so tricky to detect is that it takes advantage of Google's legitimate tool for sharing data with responsible third-party apps. Since the bogus invitation is being routed through Google's real system, nothing is misspelled, the icons look accurate, and it's hard to know something's gone wrong until it's too late. Google said Wednesday that it is working to ensure this type of "spoofing" doesn't happen again. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," the company said in a statement. Staff at The Washington Post, students at New York University and even workers at the U.S. Agency for International Development have received warnings from IT administrators not to open the emails.  Here's one clue for identifying the fraudulent email: Included on the string of recipients is an email address that begins "hhhhhhhhhhhhhh" and ends in "mailinator.com," a website that lets visitors obtain a temporary and disposable email address. So, until you hear otherwise, it's probably best to hold off on any Google Docs usage for now. If you've clicked the link in the malicious email, you can revoke the attacker's access by visiting ... - - - https://myaccount.google.com/permissions - - - ... and deleting the "Google Docs" app - which is the one pretending to be legitimate. --- Author Information: Brian Fung covers technology for The Washington Post, focusing on telecommunications, Internet access and the shifting media economy.

There's a phishing scam currently targeting thousands of people.   (Twitter)Beware any emails asking you to share a Google Docs file. There's a phishing scam currently targeting thousands of people.   (Twitter) (Newser) – Beware any offer to share a Google Docs file, even if that offer appears to have been sent by someone you know. The Los Angeles Times reports thousands of people were targeted by a phishing scam Wednesday. The scam starts with an email with a link to a Google Docs file. According to Gizmodo, this email was received by—among many others—reporters at Hearst, Vice, BuzzFeed, and New York. Clicking on the link takes targets to a fake Google Docs website, asking them to login with their Google username and password. While the email "doesn't look quite right," the website is pretty accurate, even matching Google's recent redesign. If targets log in, the fake website gets access to their contacts and sends out more phishing emails. It's unclear what, if any, information the site is stealing from victims. One way to know if the Google Docs email you just received is a scam: it appears to have been sent to "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com."   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   8% Hilarious 15% Intriguing 5% Depressing 5% Brilliant 55% Scary 12% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 8 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Next on Newser: Air Force Launches Missile That Could Carry Nuke Across World Comments Read comment policy Showing 2 of 8 comments Kanye2020 May 3, 2017 5:37 PM CDT This isn't 'sophisticated' it just doesn't look like a crappy google clone.

This is because according to reports, a number of users have been receiving such emails but in reality, these are phishing scams that have disguised themselves to look like a Google Docs invite email. Clicking on the button that says “Open in Docs” takes users to the official Google dialogue box that will grant third-party apps permission to access your account, and it will also ask for permission to “Read, send, delete, and manage your email” and “Manage your contacts.” Should you somehow fall for this scam, this app will then take over your account and use it to send more similar phishing scams to your contacts, which is probably how it plans to spread. We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail. — Gmail (@gmail) May 3, 2017 In a statement made to 9to5Google, Google said, “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.” The publication also noted that Gmail’s spam filters are already marking these messages as spam, so you should not even see them in your inbox to begin with, but if you do, like we said you’ll want to clarify it with the sender before clicking on it.

Worse, maybe you've fallen victim to the scam, yourself. For those still unscathed, here are a few tips to keep you nice and safe. As for all you innocent bystanders out there panicking after clicking on one of the links, don't freak out. Take a deep breath and read this carefully. We'll get through this together. First, what is it? People have been reporting getting emails from a known contact seeking to share a Google Doc with them. After clicking the invite and signing into what appears to be an authentic Google sign-in page, the bug then spreads to that person's contacts. The impact of the scam is still not known, according to several news outlets. I'm not even popular enough to be part of this Google Doc phishing scam smh -- Jake Whitacre (@jakewhitacre) May 3, 2017 How can you tell? One obvious sign that you've been targeted is if the email is addressed to something like, "hhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com." Also, use your judgment. Maybe there is something included in the email that you know is uncharacteristic of that known contact. How do I avoid being hit? The answer is simple: Don't click on any Google Doc invitations for the time being -- not from your mother, your father, no one. Again, a lot is still not known about this bug, and how it is affecting users, media reports have said. What do I do if I clicked on the link? First, don't beat yourself up, it isn't a reflection on you. Second, immediately change your password. Reports are also advising users to go through their Gmail Account Recovery security checklist. The good news is, it wasn't malware, which is often much more harmful, which is explained next. Malware vs. phishing scams A malware attack -- which stands for malicious software -- is not only easy to fall victim to, but once infected, the bug spreads quickly, maliciously and typically without you even knowing it. According to hoax-slayer.com, once you click a link or download an attachment containing malware, the software immediately begins to spread on your computer without your knowledge. It's a silent ambush. Like a malware attack, a phishing scam also often comes in the form of an attachment or link. However, the difference is, a phishing scam requires you to participate a little -- unwittingly of course, either by providing some kind of personal information like a username and password. Massive Google Docs phishing attack currently sweeping the internet https://t.co/nHTKrTqEzP pic.twitter.com/M1eTLDHQ10 -- Nyda Catapang (@NydaCatapang) May 3, 2017 When will this be over? Tech security companies are working to resolve the issue. The computer security firm, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), told NJ Advance Media that it was helping to resolve the scam, but was unable to provide further comment, saying they were a little busy. "Our tech folks are working on this issue as we speak," Karen Gullo, of EFF, briefly said in an email.  EFF told a Buzzfeed reporter affected by the phishing scam that it was not intended to deliver malware. According to Gizmodo, it remains unclear who was behind the attack. The website said that may never be known.  Recap Phishing attacks can usually be thwarted by the user changing his or her password. But make sure to use some numbers and symbols in there. And make sure to do it soon. Spencer Kent may be reached at skent@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @SpencerMKent.

Users are asked to click on the link, which ultimate gives the hackers behind the attack access to the contents of their Google accounts, including email, contacts and documents. Not only are victims' accounts controlled by a malicious party, but if users follow the instructions, the same email is sent to anyone they have ever emailed and their contacts. Users are asked to click on a link, which provides the hackers access to the contents of their Google accounts, including email, contacts and online documents. The malicious emails appeared to be addressed to 'hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com' with recipients BCCed PHISHING SCAM  Clicking the malicious link takes users to a what looks like a Google-hosted page that presents them with a list of their accounts. The page asks users to select one of their accounts and provide an app called 'Google Docs'. Once you press 'allow', the Google Docs app, which was developed by the cyber trouble makers, can now sift through your emails and contacts, allowing it to continue the infected chain-mail. Although it may seem harmless, experts warn that these hackers now have access to your Google account and any personal information inside. The scam seems to have surfaced sometime Wednesday afternoon and appeared to first target journalists - many reports from BuzzFeed, Hearst, New York Magazine and Gizmodo reported receiving the infected email. However, looking at one of the emails shared by Joe Berstein from Buzzfeed, it is clear to see that something is just not right. The malicious emails appeared to be addressed to 'hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com' with recipients BCCed. Victims have noted that the email sender may be someone you know or who is one of your contacts.  Users are asked to click on a link to view a document, which provides the hackers access to the contents of their Google accounts, including email, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. Clicking the malicious link takes users to a real Google-hosted page that presents them with a list of their accounts, TechCrunch reported.

Once you press 'allow', the Google Docs app, which was developed by the cyber trouble makers, can now sift through your emails and contacts, allowing it to continue the infected chain-mail. Twitter users are sharing some of the emails to warn others of the scam Google has acknowledged the attack and released a statement on Twitter notifying the public that they 'are investigating a phishing email that appears on Google Docs'. The tweet continued to read: 'We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Google' And although some may see this attack as nothing but spam, experts warn it is much more serious than that. 'This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,' Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, told Reuters. And although some may see this attack as nothing but spam, as shared in some tweets, experts warn it is much more serious than that, as hackers are now able to get into user's Google accounts Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.    Read more: PSA: This Google Doc scam is spreading fast and will email everyone you know | TechCrunch Share or comment on this article e-mail 793 shares Most watched News videos Cute orangutan is freed by rescuers after TWO YEARS in a box Argentinian man spends $35,000 on surgery to become 'real-life elf' Tory voter Malcolm Baker confronts Lib Dem leader Tim Farron Heartwarming moment stray dog leads rescuers to her ten puppies People with facial differences open up about abuse they've suffered Playboy playmate Jaylene Cook shows off her island holidays Dramatic footage shows police shoot dead gunman Peter Selis Father pulls hysterical 'blinker fluid' prank on his two girls 'Erm, they will cost': Abbott's car-crash election interview Mortifying: Diane Abbott is played her toe-curling LBC interview Comey 'mildly nauseous' thinking FBI may have affected election 'I don't give a f***': Woman strolls through airport NAKED Entire Queen's household is called to 'highly unusual'...

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

You are not alone, but do not click on it. (Courtesy photo) Did you receive a fishy looking email asking you to click on a shared Google Drive link? You are not alone, but do not click on it. The scam, targeting those with Google accounts, hit Wednesday morning. Schemes like these draw the user into clicking a link in order to gain access to information. Many who receive Google document invitations on a daily basis, like journalists, were particularly affected by the scheme and soon took to social media to dissuade others from clicking on the emails. As people realized not even links to Google drives are safe anymore, they used social media to warn others and make a fun of the situation— because, if we don’t laugh about it or make a meme, did it really happen?

obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter about us Atlas quartz index quartz app quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu JUST BING IT The newest version of Windows won’t let you change the default web browser or search engine Written by Keith Collins May 03, 2017 Touching. (Microsoft) Share Written by Keith Collins May 03, 2017 On Windows 10 S, the new operating system Microsoft unveiled this week, users will not be able to change the default web browser to something other than Microsoft Edge, or the default search engine to anything but Bing. They will also not be able to download alternative browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, because Windows 10 S will only install apps included in the Windows Store. Google and Mozilla have not yet made their browsers available there. Microsoft says this is all for the sake of security, and users who don’t like it can install Windows 10 Pro instead, which is free for students and teachers, and $49 for everyone else. A Microsoft spokesperson also said it’s up to browser vendors, not Microsoft, to make their apps available in the Windows Store. “Currently Chrome is not a verified app in the Windows Store, but we welcome Google to join us and submit it,” the spokesperson said. Whatever the reason, Microsoft has a checkered history with such restrictions. In 2013 it was fined $731 million by the European Union for forcing Internet Explorer on its users, and in 1998 was sued by the United States Department of Justice, which alleged the software company had broken antitrust laws by bundling the browser with Windows. Of course, the digital world is a very different place today than it was in 1998, and it’s become common for companies to create walled-garden environments. The iPhone doesn’t let you change its default browser to something other than Safari, and on Google’s Chromebook laptops, the operating system literally is the Chrome web browser. Another big difference is that while Internet Explorer was by far the dominant browser in 1998, Microsoft Edge does not exactly share that advantage today. It’s currently hovering just under 5% of the market share, while Chrome is around 75%. Windows 10 S is the operating system that comes with Microsoft’s new flagship Surface laptop, which was just introduced with a price tag of $999. But consumers who’ve grown used to having the freedom to download and install any software they want, unless they’re students or teachers, should probably be prepared to pay an extra $49.

The “sophisticated” scam appeared to target accounts with a malicious message – seemingly from someone in people’s address book – inviting them to share a Google Doc. PA:Press Association 5 Google has warned its Gmail users of a phishing scam asking them to open a Google Document Twitter 5 Gmail has tweeted to say it is investigating the email and urged people not to click on it but report it instead If the link is pressed it appears to go to a real Google page asking the user if they wish to allow widespread permission, which if granted gives the fraudsters full access to the account. Doing so also forwards the email on to everyone in the user’s address book, spreading the potential hack even further. Google said it is investigating the scam and urged anyone who had been sent the email not to click on it and report it within the app. MOST READ IN TECH CHILLING CHALLENGE The Blue Whale 'suicide game' is goading teens into taking their own lives with fears it's reached Britain TORRENT, OR NOT TORRENT Kodi box users could face up to TEN years in jail thanks to controversial new law X-RAY VISION DIY app which can see through WALLS goes on sale in UK... leaving thousands of builders facing the boot WHAT'S UP?

Some of the emails are address to “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com” with the targeted user seemingly copied into the BCC field. Twitter 5 Gmail users are warning others to ‘beware’ and not click on the suspicious link Twitter 5 The emails appear to come from people you know, users reported Twitter 5 This user has posted what the email they received looked like – others described it as ‘sophisticated’ The subject line reads: “[someone in your contacts] just shared a Google Doc with you,” mimicking the same style a genuine document invite would look. If you think you might have clicked the link run a Google security check up immediately. Go to the My Account page and under the “permissions” option remove the “Google Doc” app. You’ll know if it’s malicious because it will have a recent date time-stamp next to it. Affected users were quick to post on social media, warning others not to click on the email. Zeynep Tufekci wrote on Twitter: “Phishing (or malware) Google Doc links that appear to come from people you may know are going around. DELETE THE EMAIL. DON’T CLICK.” @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Zach Latta tweeted in response with a screengrab: “Just got this as well. Super sophisticated.” Another user, Michael Grinich, said: “BEWARE! There is a super bad Gmail phishing attack happening now. DO NOT click any email like this! After auth it will spam your contacts”. Scammers have been using alternative ways of targeting users including “smishing” – also known as SMS phishing. It’s an attempt at a security attack in which the phone user is either tricked into downloading a harmful virus onto their mobile device or into giving their personal data over.

Here's how it works and what to do if you clicked Illustration: Vocativ By Kevin Collier May 03, 2017 at 4:36 PM ET An email scheme — in which someone you may know sends you a link that looks an awful lot like a link to Google Docs — spread like wildfire on Wednesday. As of this writing, there’s no way to tell the scale of the attack — considered a worm, because of how it exists to replicate itself — though it is significant. From accounts social media alone, it’s clear that numerous news outlets, law firms, and high schools and colleges have been affected. At least four Vocativ employees have received such emails. Google revoked the program late Wednesday afternoon, though it’s unclear what information victims have sent to the unknown attacker who created it.  In a statement, Google said that “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs,” and that its security team had “disabled offending accounts.” Google didn’t immediately respond to a followup question about how many people would be unable to access their account, though one victim did show Vocativ The trick here is that though the email that shows up in a victim’s inbox appears to be a straightforward link to a Google Docs document, it’s actually a third-party service that Google has, inexplicably, been allowed to name itself “Google Docs.” If you fell for the scheme, as noticed by Zach Latta, an engineer and the executive director of Hack Club, whoever’s behind the attack will then ask for full permission to your Google email account — something you obviously don’t want a stranger to have. @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 “Basically, when you click the button, you’re doing the same thing as clicking a ‘login with Google’ button on some legit website,” Latta told Vocativ. From there, it appears that this malicious script self-propagates by sending the same kind of email to the contacts of whoever it just compromised. It’s unclear if it then proceeds to wreak further damage. It’s important to note that if you fall for the scheme, you should change your password — but that’s not all. It’s unclear if Google has preempted this step, but in case not, any potential victim should also revoke permissions from the fake “Google Docs” app. It’s actually pretty easy to see which apps have permissions, though, and something every Google user should review from time to time to make sure they haven’t accidentally given permissions to a third party who shouldn’t have them. Just go to myaccount.google.com/permissions to see who has access to your Google account and revoke any that don’t belong there. If a suspicious “Google Docs” is at the bottom, that’s probably the malicious script. Fortunately, it appears that right now, the malicious code did little except propagate itself. Cooper Quintin, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who’s currently studying this attack, said that it’s created to send victims’ information to at least three different servers — but all three are currently down. That’s no mistake, according to Cloudflare, one of the internet’s largest providers of DNS services — essentially an internet phone book, translating the text of a URL to the numerical address of another website’s server. The domains set to receive messages from the malicious Google Docs code actually used Cloudflare, prompting the company to shut down its service to each of them. That’s not quite the same thing as knocking them offline, but it would stand to minimize the worm’s effectiveness before Google could shut down the fake app.

The scam claimed to come from Google Docs - a service that allows people to share and edit documents online. Users who clicked a link and followed instructions, risked sending the email on to everyone in their address box. Google said it had stopped the attack "within approximately one hour", including through "removing fake pages and applications". "While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed," Google said in an updated statement. "There's no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup." Google said the spam campaign affected "fewer than 0.1%" of Gmail users. That works out to about one million people affected. Phishing is an attempt to trick people into handing over their personal information by posing as a reputable company.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Car Wars Google Accuses Uber of a “Cover-Up Scheme” to Steal Trade Secrets Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Car Wars Google Accuses Uber of a “Cover-Up Scheme” to Steal Trade Secrets The lawsuit over Uber’s driverless car technology is getting ugly. by Maya KosoffMay 3, 2017 5:30 pm Email Facebook Twitter John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo Inc., at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, January 2017. By Paul Sancya/A.P./Res/Shutterstock. Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google parent company Alphabet, and Uber faced off in court Wednesday as both companies fight to dominate the nascent driverless-car technology sector. In February, Waymo filed a lawsuit against Otto, the self-driving-truck start-up Uber bought last year, accusing its co-founder, former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski of stealing Waymo’s proprietary sensor technology and taking it to Uber. If Uber is found guilty of facilitating intellectual property theft, the ride-hailing juggernaut could be forced to stop using its current self-driving technology, crippling its ambitions to develop a fully autonomous taxi fleet. The case came to a head on Wednesday as Waymo made its case for an injunction, arguing that Levandowski deliberately plotted, while at Google, to create a company for Uber to acquire. The “cover-up scheme,” Waymo alleged in court, was a ploy for Levandowski and Uber to steal Google’s intellectual property and improve its own self-driving technology. “There was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal,” Waymo attorney Charles Verhoeven said. “There was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal.” Twitter Waymo produced a document in court that showed that Levandowski had been awarded about 5 million shares of Uber stock effective January 28, 2016, one day after he left Google, and several months before Otto, his start-up, would be acquired by Uber for more than half a billion dollars. Waymo lawyers also claimed that Levandowski had downloaded 9.7 gigabytes of data from Waymo servers before he left, transferring the data from his company laptop to an external hard drive, and ultimately reformatting the laptop’s hard drive to avoid leaving a trace. When U.S. District Judge William Alsup asked Waymo for evidence of Uber knowing that Levandowski had taken Google intellectual property with him, Waymo’s lawyers said they couldn’t provide it so long as Levandowski continues invoking his Fifth Amendment right and Uber continues withholding more than 3,000 documents. https://twitter.com/daveleebbc/status/859806179102306304 Uber dismissed Waymo’s allegations out of hand. An Uber representative explained that the vesting start date for Levandowski's stock was backdated in order to credit him for the time he spent at Otto before Uber acquired it. Lawyers for Uber argued that they had a right to assert privilege on the documents that had been withheld. “We’re not hiding anything,” Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez said. “The privilege we are claiming is a legitimate privilege.” Uber also showed off Spider, a driverless sensor system it claims to have developed on its own—which Waymo also argues uses its proprietary technology to operate. As reporters in the hearing have noted, Uber doesn’t seem to be arguing whether or not Levandowski stole any files from Google; instead, its legal team is taking the position that there’s no evidence that Levandowski brought any such files to Uber. Still, for Lewandowski, Wednesday’s hearing didn't make him look great. “You have one of the strongest records I’ve seen of somebody doing something bad,” Judge Alsup told Waymo’s lawyer on Wednesday. “Good for you.” Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

This scam is more convincing than most — the email takes users who click on the file to a legitimate Google sign-in screen to grant permissions, so it's no surprise to see widespread reports of the hacking across social media platforms like Twitter. If you received the email or are concerned you might be targeted next, here's what you need to know: Who was affected by the Google Docs scam? The phishing appears to have been aimed at journalists at first. News began making its rounds across Twitter after Joe Bernstein, a reporter at BuzzFeed, tweeted the following: I got a Google Doc invite from a BuzzFeed email address, clicked on it, and it spammed everyone I’ve ever emailed- Joe Bernstein (@Bernstein) May 3, 2017 Because the scam appears to target everyone in the victim's address book, it didn't take long before more reports from people outside of the media world began to flood in. PSA: if you get a 'someone shared a doc on google drive' notification DONT OPEN IT! It's a scam/hack that's going around the county.- Peter Miller (@jpmill13) May 3, 2017 WARNING: if you have accepted a google doc link recently from a friend and it goes to a broken link, CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY.- Sweet Maples (@KelseyMaple) May 3, 2017 Guys I was just bamboozled by the #GoogleDocHack pls don't judge just support me during my time of need- Ana✨ (@AnaTheNavigator) May 3, 2017 What happens if you open the Google phishing link? You don't want to find out by clicking yourself. But Zach Latta, a San Francisco-based hacker, tweeted a GIF that showcases the entire process. @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX- Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 As the clip shows, clicking on the file actually brings you to a real Google sign-in page, where it asks users to choose an account to continue. If you grant permissions to the link, the email spams every person in your contacts, and the cycle continues from there. We don't know what exactly happen after that, but it's definitely concerning that hackers have access to all of this contact information. The Google Docs email came from a 'Mailinator' address. What's that? Mailinator is a type of disposable email address service that lets users access emails on the Mailinator site without having to sign up for an account. "Any email name you can think of already exists @mailinator.com and you can use any of them," the official Mailinator site reads. "Want BrianTheSkink@mailinator.com? You got it. Want PrettyMothra? ScaryGavyn? No problem. Those and any other mailboxes you think of @mailinator.com are created when email arrives." One of the main advantages of using this service is that there is no connection to your real email address, making it difficult to track any emails sent from an Mailinator back to you. What should I do if I opened the Google Docs phishing email? As with any hacking case, you'll want to immediately change your passwords to secure any sensitive personal information. Google is working to restore order, according to a statement it released in a series of tweets: (1 of 3) Official Google Statement on Phishing Email: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs...- Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 (2 of 3) & have disabled offending accounts.

The virus in question pops up as an email with the subject line “documents.” It usually appears as though it comes from a Google.com domain and is extending a link to a Google document form but according to Gizmodo, that is not the case. After clicking on the “document” link, it takes you to a fake login page that looks just like the real Google login page. The scam uses a Google.com URL as well as a Google SSL encryption making the scam that much harder to notice. Scammers use this method to trick others into putting in their credentials which are then sent to a PHP script on a compromised server. A symantec security expert explained the situation in a blog, according to Gizmodo. He said “The fake page is actually hosted on Google's servers and is served over SSL, making the page even more convincing. The scammers have simply created a folder inside a Google Drive account, marked it as public, uploaded a file there, and then used Google Drive's preview feature to get a publicly accessible URL to include in their messages.” Gizmodo is offering some helpful tips to make sure you don’t become susceptible to this scam. The first suggestion is to not click on links in emails from someone you might not know, especially if the subject line just says “documents.” Second, if you do show up at the log-in screen then see if it recognizes you as a Google user. If it does not, then that is a clear sign it is part of a phishing scam.

By Selena Larson SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- A widespread phishing scheme is targeting people across the web. The sophisticated attack looks like it is coming from a trusted source asking you to open a Google Document. If you click, it takes you to a page to open the "Google Docs" app with your Google account. This grants access to your email account and contacts. Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says anyone who clicked on the link should check their Google App permissions and remove the one called "Google Docs." You can do that by clicking this link. It's unclear how widespread the attack is, but reporters at publications including BuzzFeed, CNN, and Motherboard tweeted that they'd receiving the phishing email, as had many of their sources. On Wednesday afternoon, "Google Docs" was a global trending topic on Twitter, meaning a lot of people were talking about the attacks. It's not clear who is behind the phishing attempts. This attack can spread quickly -- the fake Google Docs app can read your contacts and send more phishing attempts to your contacts. A phishing attack is a popular method of stealing credentials and hacking into people's emails, bank accounts or other private accounts. A hacker poses as a trusted source and sends you a malicious link. Experts say the phish was convincing and sophisticated. Here's what happened: Hackers created a malicious app and named it "Google Docs," which looked trustworthy. Google uses an authorization system called OAuth, which uses security tokens instead of passwords to connect your Google account with third party apps. Because the malicious app looked legit, it essentially tricked users into trusting it with their security token -- which is all that was needed to access the accounts. This is a popular phishing method -- security firm Trend Micro reported earlier this year that Russian hackers were using it. "As we have seen repeatedly, these kinds of schemes are usually the precursor to larger nefarious activities, like money transfers, planting ransomware, etc.," said Frances Zelazny, VP of cybersecurity startup BioCatch. Google said it is investigating the phishing scam. The company advises people not to click on the link and report any phishing attempts to the company. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," Google said in a statement. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again." ... the real way to address the hacks is to change the way we think about data security.

The email could be from a stranger, a colleague or a friend, but it's addressed to a contact that boasts a whole string of H's in its name. In other words, it looks a little something like this: Enlarge this image This is what the subject line may look like in the email, for people using Microsoft Outlook.

Those invitations aren't what they seem. They are in fact malicious files intended to hijack recipients' accounts — and Google advises its users not to open them. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," a Google spokesperson says in a statement emailed to NPR. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing," the statement continues, "and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail.— Gmail (@gmail) May 3, 2017 If this public service announcement has reached you too late and you're now staring in despair at an already opened link, Vice's Motherboard explains what to do next: "If you have clicked on the link, go to your Google account's page (https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) where you can manage the permissions you've granted to apps (or go through the whole Google Security Checkup). Then locate the 'Google Doc' app. This looks totally legitimate, but it's actually not. If that's the malicious app that's gotten access to your account after you clicked on the link it should have a recent 'Authorization Time.' Now, click on that Google Docs app and click 'Remove.'

Many people — especially journalists — reported receiving these invites Wednesday afternoon. Enough people, in fact, that the hashtag #PhishingScam began trending on Twitter and email inboxes clogged with nearly as many warnings about the scam as instances of the scam itself.

So let's check in with Uber and Waymo, the ride-hailing app maker and the Google self-driving car spinoff, which are duking it out in court. When autonomous vehicle upstart Waymo sued Uber for patent infringement in February, at first it seemed like a classic Silicon Valley legal ploy: tie down your rival as you expand your market, and perhaps extract millions in a legal settlement in the process. But as was made plain in court in San Francisco over the past few weeks, the lawsuit appears to be no backhand business stratagem: the man Uber hired to head up its self-driving car department had gone to some lengths to steal proprietary technology from his former employer, Waymo's lawyers alleged. Anthony Levandowski worked as an engineer at Google-owned Waymo but left to start up his own company, called Otto, which would focus on autonomous trucks. Otto was later acquired by Uber for $680m. However, Waymo started growing suspicious of Uber's technology shortly afterwards, and quickly concluded that it was exactly the same as its technology. It now accuses Levandowski of stealing 14,000 confidential files and claimed in court today that the entire Otto company setup was nothing but a legal ruse cooked up by Levandowski and Uber senior management to hide the fact that he was effectively working for Uber the day he walked out the door at Waymo. The evidence? A stock option that vested on January 28, 2016 – the day after Levandowski resigned from Waymo, giving no notice. The option was for five million Uber shares – worth more than $250m. Uber claims it backdated its stock option to the formation of the startup that it was acquiring – something it claims is common. Waymo's lawyers are skeptical to say the least. Emails They also pointed in court to emails between Uber executives that discussed the creation of a company – "NewCo" – in relation to an upcoming meeting with Levandowski. On one, an attachment titled "NewCo_Milestones_v5" was sent to Uber's then-vice president of mapping Brian McClendon (he resigned in March) with the note: "This list of deliverables is a high bar for sure. But then again so is what [Levandowski] is asking for in $$." Waymo's lawyers argue this is a clear sign of collusion and a quid pro quo: money for technology. The lawyers also complained that they had been prevented from seeing approximately 3,500 emails and documents from Uber and Levandowski, the implication being: if we found this in the docs they shared, what do you think is in the rest of it? On that point, Uber may be in trouble: Judge William Alsup is a big fan of transparency and repeatedly asked why court documents should not be made public. However, Alsup had not completely bought in, noting that Waymo had sued Uber and not Levandowski personally. "What if it turns out that Uber is totally innocent?," he asked, and the company simply paid for a gifted engineer with no idea he was downloading documents? As might be expected, especially from a company with Uber's reputation for aggressive tactics, the company's lawyers did not take all this kindly. Uber's main lawyer, Arturo González, lit up the courtroom railing about Waymo and arguing forcefully why it should not have to hand over any more documents. Uber had "nothing to hide," he argued, and would make the company's controversial CEO Travis Kalanick available for deposition. Levandowski, meanwhile, is pleading the fifth. Bang to rights But amid all the fire and brimstone, it quickly became clear that Uber was not planning to argue that Levandowski did not steal the files. Even the judge conceded that the evidence against Levandowski was pretty convincing, albeit without a "smoking gun," and congratulated Waymo's lawyer for compiling it all, even calling Levandowski "radioactive." The argument then turned to whether Waymo should be granted a preliminary injunction against Uber that would effectively freeze its self-driving tech efforts. Uber said it was happy to agree to take Levandowski out of the equation, but didn't think it should be prevented from working on the technology – which Waymo claims is theirs. Uber claims it doesn't even use the technology at the center of the dispute. Meanwhile, Levandowski has been shifted away from his role heading Uber's self-driving research for at least the remainder of the case. And then, just when things couldn't get any crazier, the courtroom was today interrupted by an announcement that everyone should shelter in place: there had been a police shooting just outside the courthouse and everyone was on lockdown. It has since emerged that two police officers encountered a man stabbing another on the main Market street and shot the stabber, who died. When the lockdown was lifted, Judge Alsup said the afternoon session would be held in private. And that ended another day of what promises to be a fascinating and extraordinary case about the ethics – or lack of them – in Silicon Valley when it comes to one of its hottest technologies. ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments MORE Uber Court Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Uber cloaked its spying and all it got from Apple was a slap on the wrist Greyball snoopware even 'geofenced' Cupertino 61 Comments Robo-Uber T-boned, rolls onto side, self-driving rides halted Autonomous car was not at fault, apparently 43 Comments Overcharge customers, underpay the serfs.

LG G6 already down to $500 at T-Mobile, plus free Google Home and G Pad X tablet Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 11:16am PDTMay 3, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares130 G6 LG News T-Mobile Just the other day we noticed that LG's G6 was $600 at B&H, and now the month-old flagship is down to $500 at T-Mobile. The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H, but, for those of you on the magenta carrier, it is $100 less and comes with a free G Pad X. You can even use it to take advantage of LG's current promo and pick up a Google Home. $500 for a phone, tablet, and Google Home is a pretty sweet deal if the $800 GS8 and its curvy screen doesn't appeal to you. I hope these rapid drops in price aren't a sign of trouble for LG, but in the meantime, they do serve consumers pretty well. The G6 was well regarded in our review. We found the screen to be a pretty great IPS panel if that's your preference. Battery life was also decent, and the size and feel of the phone both struck us well. If you're interested in trying out the future of flagship aspect ratios and rounded screens, the G6 is a decent way to go. The promotion for a free Google Home ($114 right now) sweetens the deal pretty well, too. All these offers have a couple of small caveats you should keep in mind if you're interested in picking up a free Google Home and G Pad X with your G6. For the Google Home you have to order your phone by May 7th, which is just a few days away, and you have to submit your registration for the promo online by the 22nd. The G Pad X requires that you hold a plan through T-Mobile with at least 2GB of data, and keep your service for 24 months. The precise terms and conditions are available at the links below.

Marty Not for a 32GB one these days. A flagship with last gen SoC, no quad DAC and the smallest memory. Simon Are you concerned by this? I'm not sure since you made only 3 comments in 3 minutes about it. Marty Yeah, I don't sound too concerned. But it's a concern. 😉 needa Making my third in three minutes here so you can see my concern also. needa $500 is the right price with those specs. Home is the bonus. Marty Get a Oneplus 3T. 128GB and SD821. Plus it has 6GB RAM. Mine works beautifully. And it's gorgeous. All for $480. needa Yeah but still have the screen and the cameras. I'd buy the 3T in a heartbeat over this. But I don't care that much about the 128. Most I ever had on my 64 OPO over the three years was thirty'ish. Deleted ten gb in roms and was back in action. Mike Not waterproof, much worse camera, update support is a giant question mark, screen is lower quality. One is a true flagship the other is a mid ranger and it shows. Marty What's wrong with the display? Mine's already updated to 7.1.1. And there's a plethora of software options in Beta. And the camera makes beatiful pics. It loads as fast as any Samsung camera. Mike If you're going to talk about current flagship specs, a screen from flagships released, what, two or three years ago doesn't make sense. Also, the OnePlus 2/X still hasn't seen Nougat, OnePlus has yet to prove they can continue with support for older devices. Marty Perfectly fine and beautiful display. It looks better than the display in my Nexus 6P. Bob Marley Except it's not. The pixel density on the OP3T display is effectively the same as the iPhone 7 due to the Pentile subpixel layout. If you have even average vision, the lack of sharpness is apparent, especially on text. Marty It looks gorgeous to me. And quantity isnt quality. needa The OPO ended with the November 2016 security patch. That is all of your fingers and toes, in months, plus a few more. They are lagging behind with the 2/x... no doubt. But they have proven support for older devices. More than some other mainstream OEMs. And with that... I have exceeded my maximum number of comments on a page by about six. See yall later. P. Sherman Sony released Nougat to Xperia Z5 and Z3+. They were released around the same time OnePlus 2 was released. Their attitude to OnePlus 2 and their users is beyond pathetic. needa Not denying they aren't behind. And not denying that they should throw the OP2 users a bone. But you can't use one example and generalize the company. Every single OEM has had their flagship that didn't get updated at a reasonable rate, or updated at all. "The beta test is over". needa hmm. ATT s6 just now getting nougat. I know I know. Oneplus is the worst. They released a new phone only few months after the s6 was released... and It DOesn't HAVe NOUGat YET? Omg. The travesty. Samsung must have been cracking the whip on their 'small team' of developers. tl;dr. It will all be ok. Life will go on. Marty Ohh...by the way, my G5 is on Android 6.0.1 with no sign of any future update. My G4 is on Android 6 and also with no sign of any future update. I'd say LG is worse than any of them for updates. needa 1080 vs 2k isn't about the quality. The 3T has a killer screen. Can't say anything about their support as the OPO that I finally sat down two days ago is still working as good as the day I got it. Just a bit long in the tooth. ie. three years of charging and hindered by the tech back then. Marty Thank you. Exactly. Resolution isn't a factor in quality just like MPs are a factor in picture quality. deibed LOL mike you're a savage, he was feeling all superior with his spec knowledge, and you come and hit him with facts...lol southerndinner Terrible support, never gets updated, incredibly unethical company, no IP rating and poor screen quality. I don't care much for LG but this is a way better deal than the 3T Marty What about my LG G4 and G5 that never get updated? My Oneplus 3T is on Android 7.1.1. The display is gorgeous and better looking than the display in my Nexus 6P. But let me guess, you're one of those people who equates screen quality with pixel resolution? If so, you probably determine a camera's quality based on its pixel count. Jasdeep Singh The S8 effect. LG remains under Samsung's shadow! Marty Because LG makes stupid decisions. Snubbing the American market isn't wise. New_Guy Not to mention they squandered their chance to take over Android the market by constantly putting sub-par cameras in the M-line (4 Ultra Pixels......c'mon man). The only reason I got the Moto X 2014 over the M8 was because of the camera. needa Definitely the new guy. HTC New_Guy Yeah, I was trippin' there for a second....been a long g day already. needa Lol. I hear yah. I have done the same thing before. New_Guy I'd delete the comment, but whatevs.... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Matthew Scott Smith I didn't see a mention of HTC in the above comments, but HTC is doing much worse than LG presently. New_Guy Yeah, I sort of lost myself there for a moment...been a long day, haha ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The S8 trumps the G6. Sammy got LG running like a scalded dog BC LG will eternally be the second and sometimes third best, as their poor choices are constantly going to make their phones less appealing. The gimped USA version had been a nonstarter to me, Smartworld is a POS...I didn't want to deal with that after the LG V20, which even after a factory reset started to become janky. I just wish LG would step up their game and become competition to Samsung. LG needs to freshen up their Android Skin, continue to work on their features and software. BigDeeNY99 exactly why i dont rush anymore to purchase the new next best phone.. Eric Vaughan Also comes with the LG G Pad X 8.0? Seems like a good deal. Marty LG disgusts me. Always skimping for the US market. 32GB max and no quad DAC. balthazar The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H[...] What are the differences? Ryne Hager T-Mobile has a more limited set of frequencies listed for their model, and B&H has the unlocked model that supports a pretty broad range. I can't be sure that the T-Mobile version is locked or unlocked or supports any frequencies outside what T-Mobile lists. Justin W Usually T-Mobile locks their network support. You can temporarily unlock, or permanent unlock, but that depends on your standing with the company. Well, unless this time around is different - the V20 I just picked up has those stipulations in place. Rod Flop much? Sohit will this work on Verizon? Margaritas Ante Porcos Great deal indeed. Although even in my medieval country g6 goes for around $600 bucks. Samsungs will drop s8 prices soon. Only few crazy nerds are buying those phones for 800. Suicide_Note A few thousand buy LG's wares, while millions have already bought the S8/S8+, and I'm sure they're not all 'nerds' as you put it. MRIANB Wow, LG is desperate and phone must not be selling against S8. Ryan Bartz Aside from the iPhone no phone can compete with Samsung. Samsung releases a respectable phone with half backed software (nothing has changed) and people forget about LG which is a damn good no gimmick phone Martin Watched couple videos on YouTube and the phone is pretty damn good. And this deal is pretty sweet. Wish I was in US... Here butt naked G6 is $650.... :) TechGuy22 299 and i'd buy it Marty Same for me. At that price point, not having the quad DAC and the small memory doesn't hurt too bad. sebastianer If they are powered with random bootlooping technology… I'm totally in. Arysyn While I'm not a fan of the LG G6, this isn't a bad price, especially for what is included. It would be an even better deal if priced to go against the ZTE Axon 7, as the G6 still is a much better device, despite the features I think LG ought to have included in the G6. JD At this rate you might as well just get right to where the G6 will end up. You get a free boot-looping G6 with the purchase of every Google Home. Mike The Galaxy S8 forced the markdown J_Grouchy The "free" tablet ($240 value) requires a $10/month data plan for 24 months. Funny how that math works... Mike in KC Now throw in a BOGO deal on top of that price and I'm in. southerndinner LOL in the bargain bin already RIP LG Mobile PhillipeFelut the V20 and G6 are 50% off on at&t next as well fyi DroidBlaze I'm still liking my s7e but if the US g6 had 64gb and the quad dac I would have seriously considered getting it.

Play Store v7.8 prepares to add pre-registration rewards, settings for Instant Apps, Play Protect, and more [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 5:46pm PDTMay 2, 2017 40 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 No more toggle for auto-add to the home screen 1.2 Subtle reminder about automatic updates 2 Teardown 2.1 Instant Apps are getting closer 2.2 Play Protect 2.3 Pre-registration "rewards" 3 Download The Play Store has just been updated to version 7.8 as of this morning, at least for some people. This release brings a couple of small changes to the interface and a few bigger changes in preparation for the future. Google has added a little reminder note to get people back on track with automatic updates, meanwhile it has also removed a toggle on some devices that gave users a choice about whether icons should be added to the home screen for newly installed apps. (But don't worry, that's conditional.) On the teardown front, we can see big signs of progress for Instant Apps, a move toward branding the malware scanner, and a clue that pre-registering for apps may finally be worth something besides a reminder notification. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) 'Add icon to the Home screen' setting has been removed in some situations. Added a reminder message if automatic updates aren't enabled. No more toggle for auto-add to the home screen Left: previous version. Right: latest version. The one functional change some users will probably notice right away is the disappearance of the "Add icon to home screen" toggle in the Settings screen. Don't worry, this doesn't apply to every device; in fact, it only appears to impact Nexus devices running the Google Launcher. The toggle remains visible on my Pixel with its default "Pixel Launcher" and my S7 edge using the Google Launcher. So, does this really matter? Probably not after a matching toggle was recently added to the Google Launcher. Oddly, the Pixel Launcher doesn't trigger the setting to go away. Perhaps that will make more sense later. While I haven't tested this with other launchers, I'm not sure what happens on different devices that have multiple launchers installed or a third party launcher is set to be the default. This does bring up a point of consistency. Perhaps this is just the first step in a process of getting numerous launchers to add this feature on their own, and that would be fine. However, if it doesn't happen, users will have a hard time instructing each other on where to go just to find this simple setting. Subtle reminder about automatic updates Left: previous version. Right: latest version. The other notable change you'll find lurking about is in the Updates tab of the My Apps screen. This is also a conditional change, but it's bound to whether or not you have Automatic Updates enabled. Whatever your setting, you'll now see a message reflecting this status located below the count of pending updates. There's no button to instantly enable automatic updates, but there's probably no need since most users would have to intentionally disable the feature to get to this point. This might technically be there to nag users, but it's non-intrusive and objectively helpful for anybody that switches settings from time to time, so I think it's good. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Instant Apps are getting closer It's no mystery that Instant Apps are in development, Google has been talking it since the announcement at I/O 2016 and we've covered some of the early tests. But, we're not really there yet. Google is still keeping things limited to select developers and hasn't really done much to let anybody else know what is required to build software capable of acting like an Instant App. In fact, unless you know exactly which apps to try and how to use them, we may as well not even have Instant Apps at all. The closest most will get are the updates to a small Play services support package that enables support. However, things just got a little more interesting. The latest Play Store update includes some notable settings that will be used with Instant Apps when they become available. Right now, it's basically just a new Settings screen, but it includes a few key features like the options to completely disable Instant Apps or change the account they will associate with if one is needed. Evidently, only a single account will be supported at this time? There is also an option titled "turn on required setting" that will allow the links to be opened in apps. Yeah, that probably should be turned on. code <string name="instant_apps_settings_title">Instant Apps account</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_description">You can use apps without installing them. Choose a Google Account to use for app sign-in and payments.</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_turn_instant_apps_off">None</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_opt_out_dialog_title">Turn off Instant Apps?</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_opt_out_dialog_description">All instant apps and associated app data, including app permissions, will be removed for the current account.</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_opt_out_dialog_ok">turn off</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_opt_out_dialog_cancel">cancel</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_change_account_dialog_title">Change account?</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_change_account_dialog_description">All instant apps and associated app data, including app permissions, will be removed for the current account.</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_change_account_dialog_ok">change account</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_change_account_dialog_cancel">cancel</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_open_links_dialog_title">Turn on required setting</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_open_links_dialog_description">For this feature to work also turn on Open links in apps</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_open_links_dialog_ok">turn on now</string> <string name="instant_apps_settings_open_links_dialog_cancel">cancel</string> <string name="instant_app_settings_menu_help">Help</string> Implementation details are scarce, but this release does reveal a couple of specifics that I don't recall seeing before. Notably, there is now a syntax that can be defined in the AndroidManifest.xml of an installed app to make activities, services, and other components visible to Instant Apps. All a developer will have to do is add a visibleToInstantApps parameter and an instantapps.clients.allowed meta tag to anything they want to expose. android:visibleToInstantApps="true" <meta-data android:name="instantapps.clients.allowed" android:value="true" /> This stands out in the Play Store app because three things have already been given this treatment: The main Play Store activity, a URL handler, and a service for performing in-app purchases. The IAP service should need no explanation since even Google pitched Instant Apps as a way to perform transactions of various types in a native interface. The other two activities are likely there to give users an upgrade path to actually install the full version of an Instant App if they decide it's worth keeping on a device. code <activity android:name="com.google.android.finsky.activities.LaunchUrlHandlerActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" android:visibleToInstantApps="true"> <activity android:name="com.google.android.finsky.activities.MainActivity" android:exported="true" android:label="@string/launcher_name" android:launchMode="singleTask" android:theme="@style/MainActivityTheme" android:visibleToInstantApps="true"> <service android:name="com.google.android.finsky.billing.iab.InAppBillingService" android:visibleToInstantApps="true"> All in all, this still doesn't really mean Instant Apps are ready to go live. However, with Google I/O 2017 closing in quickly, it it's hard to imagine the event could pass us by without formally launching. I suppose we'll see in a couple of weeks. Play Protect Welcome to Google's branding department, get ready to say a new name. The new entrant to the game is called "Play Protect," and it's basically the formal name for the malware scanner included with the Play Store. The previous update included evidence that there were things happening with the scanner, and now it appears that it's important enough to warrant its own official name. code <string name="menu_play_protect">Play Protect</string> <string name="verified_by_play_protect">Verified by Play Protect</string> <string name="myapps_security_learn_more">Play Protect</string> <string name="myapps_security_learn_more_link">&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Play Protect&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning">Play Protect is scanning…</string> <string name="myapps_security_several_phas_message">%1$d harmful apps found. %2$s. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Play Protect&lt;/a&gt;</string> The text includes the standard Learn More links and even the promissory statement that installed apps have been "Verified by Play Protect." Beyond that, there's not really much to say, it just looks like Google is trying really hard to up the visibility of a built-in virus scanner. Of course, this much attention may also suggest Google is working on something new. Again, we'll just have to keep an eye out for details, especially at I/O where an on-stage presentation might make for good press. Pre-registration "rewards" Building hype for a major new release is so standard in the gaming industry, it's actually weird when it doesn't happen. Meanwhile, most mobile games get less attention than emails from a Nigerian prince with a foolproof plan to make everybody rich by moving money through our personal bank accounts. Google extended an open hand to big game developers in 2015 by introducing a pre-registration system to the Play Store that allowed users to sign up for games before they were officially released, and then receive a notification when the time came. Plenty of games and a few apps have taken advantage of the feature, but it's not really that special since pre-registration does nothing more than promise a notification. Clues in the latest update suggest Google may be taking things to the next level with real incentives for users to join the waitlist. New text in the apk mentions "pre-registration rewards" and target milestones that are met when enough people join the waitlist. Naturally, this type of system is used to encourage users to share spread the news via social networks in hopes of building toward that next target. After all, word-of-mouth advertising is the holy grail... Or something like that. <string name="preregistration_milestone_rewards_title">Pre-registration rewards</string> <string name="preregistration_milestone_rewards_subtitle">From %1$s</string> <string name="preregistration_milestone_rewards_terms_label">See full terms</string> <string name="preregistration_reward_milestone_target">Milestone %1$d: %2$s registrations</string> Strictly speaking, I'm making a small assumption that this is related to games and apps, while it actually could be intended for other types of content like books and movies, which also have similar pre-registration features. However, these markets aren't known for milestone-based rewards, so I think the assumption is well-founded. Marketing programs like these are usually very successful and might go a long way toward encouraging major game studios to give a little more attention on mobile platforms where they've had a lot of challenges in the past. I can't think of much else to say, but I think we should all look forward to the inevitable promise of extra in-game currency to early registrants. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Darkaeluz gives you in-game rewards for pre-registering Total Insecurity Nice, I tried. But it doesn't do that for me in Germany. Might be a location server side change :) Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Slightly relevant rant - When the new "My Apps" layout had rolled out, I was so happy that I can just tap "refresh" button there to see if any new updates are there. Not so fast. I don't want to update Timehop, so it always stays in the "Available update" section and no refresh button. Only way to refresh it is force stop and relaunch. Sigh. Tiuri Elvander Yep, I have the same problem Very annoying. Maybe i'm becoming more critical, but increasingly, I feel developers no longer listen to their users and thus I refuse to update their app. For instance, I'm not updating Chrome to 58 until that annoying New Tab page is gone. Most people on AP and Reddit don't like the removal of the buttons and very few appreciate the suggested (spam) links on the new Tab page but (on Reddit at least) the Chrome developer simply ignores the comments that are critical (despite asking for feedback). Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There are some devs who say "Give us feedback" just to sound community friendly. But they do whatever the hell they want. Their fanbase is so strong that you can't comment anything negative. Sarath Chandra Gullapalli I think AndroidPolice should launch an app - not for the news articles or the usual contents of the website - but to keep testing and trying out the elements being discovered in teardowns. I think we'd love such a thing.

Google is warning people about a phishing scam that is making the rounds, warning people to NOT open any Google docs they receive in their inbox. We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail. — Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 Instead, report the email to Google as a phishing scam. The email will look something like this: Courtesy KFOR The name “Ruby McCaslin” could vary. The sender could even be one of your contacts, but that does not mean the email is safe to open. Also look at the “to” section to see who else is on the email list. If the email is being sent to “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com” and you are blind-copied, it is part of the phishing scheme. If the link is opened, it will look like you are being taken to Google docs. However, instead it’s a program that will send spam emails to everyone in your address book.

"We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," a Google spokesperson says in a statement emailed to NPR. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing," the statement continues, "and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.

Then locate the 'Google Doc' app. This looks totally legitimate, but it's actually not. If that's the malicious app that's gotten access to your account after you clicked on the link it should have a recent 'Authorization Time.' Now, click on that Google Docs app and click 'Remove.'

By: Sudhir Chowdhary | Published: May 4, 2017 3:34 AM With a tap on the download icon, you can save a specific map area for offline use, so you can trust you’ll get to where you need to go, even when you lose connectivity. (Source: Reuters) Google Maps is invariably the preferred and dependable resource whenever one needs to locate a local business, view maps or get directions. Starting this week, Google is rolling out a new home screen on Google Maps for Android, specifically designed for people in India. After you update to the latest version of Google Maps, you’ll see newly added shortcuts on the home screen that help you explore the app in just a few quick taps. Google is making sure the new home screen loads fast – so that millions of people in India coming online can discover and share great places, even on spotty connections. Now, when you open your Google Maps app, you will instantly see a directions card with different modes of transportation. Whether you’d like to take the bus to Connaught Place in New Delhi or you are planning to go by foot to a new mall that just opened nearby, you can start planning your route with a single tap. And if you would like to access a certain route while you’re on the go without using data, you can save the route to be used offline. You might also want to see this: Below the directions card, you’ll also see icons highlighting some of the other useful features on Maps—from getting a first impression of a place with satellite imagery, to real-time information about traffic around you, to more details about public transport lines when you’re on the road. All these features are now just a tap away. In addition, with a tap on the download icon, you can save a specific map area for offline use, so you can trust you’ll get to where you need to go, even when you lose connectivity. Google officials feel this new home screen will provide a much more intuitive and faster experience for people in India. “The Maps team will continue to evolve Google’s products to make them useful no matter where you go or what you do, especially for the millions of people coming online for the first time,” says Cathay Bi, product manager, Google Maps.

Reports on Wednesday suggest large numbers of people have clicked invites to view a fake Google Docs file. While this isn't uncommon, this particular scam has been successful due to the invite looking remarkably similar to the real deal. After clicking the document users are being transported to a new portal that also does a good impression of a Google.com URL. Users are being asked to confirm which of their Google accounts they would like to use to read the file. Once that’s confirmed, it appears the attacker gains access to the Google account, meaning emails, contacts, documents and more. This isn't just some 'Nigerian prince' type scam, this is so sophisticated even a number of web-savvy tech journalists were caught out on Wednesday. Here’s what the attack looked like in real time: Even though this is a sophisticated attack that can easily fool an unsuspecting user, there are a couple of easy ways to avoid this. If you receive an unexpected email from an unknown contact featuring an invite to edit a Google Doc, the best policy is just to delete it immediately. There’s also a telltale sign that its a scan: The sender’s email address is 'hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com'. Unless this person had really mean parents, that's not a real person. In a statement, Google says the accounts associated with the scam have now been disabled and the fake pages have been removed, which should take care of things. The company wrote: “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.” If you've been scammed, we'd recommend an immediate password change to lock out the attackers as quickly as possible.

In the Google Docs scam, victims received an email that said an acquaintance wanted to share a Google Doc. If the link was clicked, the user was directed to a web page that asked for log-in information that looked like an official Google page. If the account information was entered, hackers would instantly have access to all of the user’s Google accounts. Reports of the scam were first reported around 2.30 p.m. Eastern time (1830GMT) and Google said the issue was resolved about 30 minutes later. “We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs,” the Google Docs team tweeted. “We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail.” The scammers built an app inside Google that collected the victims’ information. The app was confusingly named “Google Docs” to avoid raising eyebrows. In order to quickly solve the issue, the company simply revoked the deceptively-titled app. It is unclear how much damage the program caused but the response on Twitter and elsewhere online suggests the scam was widespread. Gmail has about 1 billion users worldwide, Google revealed last year. Security experts recommend Gmail users delete emails that ask them to click on a shared Google Doc. If the account information was inputted, users should check authorized apps at myaccount.google.com/permissions. If Google Docs is one of the apps, users should immediately revoke permission for the app and change passwords.

Image: Gizmodo / Pexels This morning, countless unsuspecting email users — including reporters from BuzzFeed, New York Magazine, Vice, as well as your friends here at Gizmodo Media — received some seemingly legit invites to view a Google Docs file. The email doesn't look quite right, but anyone who clicks through arrives at a login screen that looks almost indistinguishable from the same screen you'd see if someone actually invited you to a Google Doc. It's the one with a list of your Google Accounts, and it even matches Google's recent redesign. Beware Of This Dangerously Convincing Google Docs Phishing Scam A very tricky phishing scam that takes advantage of Google Docs is making its way around the web. And since it uses a google.com URL and even makes use of Google's SSL encryption, it's almost impossible to tell that it's a hack. Your best safeguard, as always, is a little bit of common sense. Read more What's even scarier than that, the page has a very real-looking Google.com URL and clicking on a link to Google Docs appears to confirm the page's authenticity. It gets worse. That page invites to choose which account you'd like to use to view the Google Doc, and then you're taken to a page that invites you to grant access to your Google Account. Here's what the whole attack looks like: @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 If you get an email that looks like the one above, delete it immediately. There's a good chance that it will appear to have been sent by someone with a legit-looking email address. One Gizmodo reader even shared an email that had come from a .gov email address. This kind of thing is easy to spoof, however. There are a couple of telltale signs that this email is bullshit. It's addressed to "hhhhhhhhhhh", and the email itself doesn't look quite like the ones that Google sends. That, and the fact that countless members of the media are reporting on Twitter that the email is a phishing scam. (The EFF told Joe Bernstein from BuzzFeed, where some of the earliest emails were spotted, that the attack was not intended to deliver malware but rather hijack credentials, another term for phishing.) It's still unclear who's behind this attack, and we might never know. We reached out to Google for more information on the attack but had not heard back at time of writing.. In the meantime, be safe out there. And maybe don't click on any Google Doc links for the rest of the week. Update 1:52PM: Gmail has addressed the attack on Twitter: We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail. — Gmail (@gmail) May 3, 2017 Google has also sent us the following statement by way of a PR agency: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. Google then sent us another statement, this time not from a PR agency but attributable directly to a Google spokesperson: We realize people are concerned about their Google accounts, and we’re now able to give a fuller explanation after further investigation. We have taken action to protect users against an email spam campaign impersonating Google Docs, which affected fewer than 0.1% of Gmail users. We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions, including removing the fake pages and applications, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, and other anti-abuse systems. We were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour. While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed. There’s no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup.

It's not as radical and influential as the Surface Pro or as crazy looking as the Surface Book. From afar the silver Surface Laptop looks like something as easily made by Apple or Asus as by Microsoft. It feels like that too, with the same heft as a powerful premium laptop like the 2016 MacBook Pro or the exceptional Asus ZenBook 3. Despite being a good looking hunk of hardware, the Surface Laptop is remarkable for how perfectly mundane it in light of recent Microsoft computer products. Surface Laptop Is Microsoft's Shot At A Portable Computer For Everyone Michael Nunez 03 May 2017 9:30 AM Meet Microsoft's Surface Laptop, a portable computer made for basically everyone and meant to take on high-design competitors like the Apple MacBook. The new Surface Laptop is lightweight, ships with the newly announced Windows 10 S (but can be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro), and includes many familiar details featured on other Microsoft hardware products.

Those invitations aren't what they seem. They are in fact malicious files intended to hijack recipients' accounts — and Google advises its users not to open them. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," a Google spokesperson says in a statement emailed to NPR. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing," the statement continues, "and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.

Then locate the 'Google Doc' app. This looks totally legitimate, but it's actually not. If that's the malicious app that's gotten access to your account after you clicked on the link it should have a recent 'Authorization Time.' Now, click on that Google Docs app and click 'Remove.'

It’s probably a phishing scam that could compromise your account. Internet users everywhere are being spammed with what appear to be malicious invitations to log on to their Google accounts. Unlike your garden-variety cyberattack, many of the telltale signs that could tip you off that something is awry are absent. For example, the attack appears to work by tricking you into logging into your actual Google account, then granting a third party (your attacker) access to your account’s data. Having gained permission to access your contacts, the attacker then fires off spam invites to everyone in your address book. What makes this attack so tricky to detect is that it takes advantage of Google’s legitimate tool for sharing data with responsible third-party apps. Since the bogus invitation is being routed through Google’s real system, nothing is misspelled, the icons look accurate, and it’s hard to know something’s gone wrong until it’s too late. Google said Wednesday that it is working to ensure this type of “spoofing” doesn’t happen again. “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” the company said in a statement. Here’s one clue for identifying the fraudulent email: Included on the string of recipients is an email address that begins “hhhhhhhhhhhhhh” and ends in “mailinator.com,” a website that lets visitors obtain a temporary and disposable email address. So, until you hear otherwise, it’s probably best to hold off on any Google Docs usage for now. If you’ve clicked the link in the malicious email, you can revoke the attacker’s access by visiting https://myaccount.google.com/permissions and deleting the “Google Docs” app – which is the one pretending to be legitimate.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Telco Digital Transformation Revenue and Growth Rate Research Report New York, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/03/2017 — Telco digital transformation: Lessons from the world’s most powerful digital companies „Telco Digital Transformation: Lessons from the world’s most powerful digital companies”, a thematic research report, examines effective strategies for telcos to capitalize on the explosive growth in the consumption of digital services. The report identifies key lessons in digital prowess from major brands including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon that have led the value shift from technology provision to enablement, and provides and in-depth analysis of telco strategies to transform their internal operations, coming up with new technology use cases and exploring new service and revenue models.

Apple and Google taught us how to pioneer revolutionary business models. Amazon showed us how to masterfully virtualize a brick-and-mortar industry, and Facebook transformed the definition of content services, putting the user as the central author. – Telecom service providers know first-hand the impact of the digital revolt, as SMS and traditional voice services become increasingly replaced by IP-based voice and messaging apps such as Skype and WhatsApp. Telcos have been catalysts of the transformation of mobile devices from communications tools to life management hubs. Yet, to thrive in the digital economy requires far more than technology or product prowess– it calls for entirely novel service models. – To secure a profitable slice of the new digital domain, telecom service providers need to transform how they deliver services, content and apps. Telco digital transformation begins with a digital corporate culture to drive the discovery of new innovation engines, disruptive business models and digitally-smart customer relationship platforms. Telecom companies that can turn the challenge of digital transformation into profitable opportunities will prevail. Synopsis The „Telco digital transformation: Lessons from the world’s most powerful digital companies” report analyzes the growth drivers of digital services, strategies of leading digital companies, as well as case studies on the digital transformation of four major telecom services providers. Data and insights are derived through a mix of desk-based secondary research and qualitative primary research. The report is structured as follows: Section 1: Market context – digital services growth drivers and trends.

It's Best Not To Click Facebook Twitter Google+ Email May 3, 20175:50 PM ET Colin Dwyer Twitter There's a decent chance you — or someone you know — just got an odd email inviting you to edit a document in Google Docs. The email could be from a stranger, a colleague or a friend, but it's addressed to a contact that boasts a whole string of H's in its name. In other words, it looks a little something like this: Enlarge this image This is what the subject line may look like in the email, for people using Microsoft Outlook. The telltale sign something's amiss: that email address with that long line of H's.

Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX— Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Either of these look familiar to you? Here's a handy tip: Don't open the link. Those invitations aren't what they seem. They are in fact malicious files intended to hijack recipients' accounts — and Google advises its users not to open them. "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts," a Google spokesperson says in a statement emailed to NPR. "We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing," the statement continues, "and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through, & report as phishing within Gmail.— Gmail (@gmail) May 3, 2017 If this public service announcement has reached you too late and you're now staring in despair at an already opened link, Vice's Motherboard explains what to do next: "If you have clicked on the link, go to your Google account's page (https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) where you can manage the permissions you've granted to apps (or go through the whole Google Security Checkup). Then locate the 'Google Doc' app. This looks totally legitimate, but it's actually not. If that's the malicious app that's gotten access to your account after you clicked on the link it should have a recent 'Authorization Time.' Now, click on that Google Docs app and click 'Remove.'

Many people — especially journalists — reported receiving these invites Wednesday afternoon. Enough people, in fact, that the hashtag #PhishingScam began trending on Twitter and email inboxes clogged with nearly as many warnings about the scam as instances of the scam itself. Work emails amirite #PhishingScam pic.twitter.com/1wLEzzxYPv— Ibrahim Balkhy (@ibalkhy) May 3, 2017 So, once you successfully delete that phishy email — or take steps to remove its gnarled claws from your hapless inbox — you can take comfort in the fact that, no matter what ails you, Twitter has some snark to cure it.

We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail. — Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 This particular email could seem innocuous enough as it may come from someone you know, as Reddit user JakeSteam explained. “I received an email that a Google Doc had been shared with me. Looked reasonably legit, and I recognized the sender,” he wrote. Story continues below But a closer look shows that the email wasn’t sent by a contact, but by an automatically-generated email, such as hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com. He went on to explain that although the email itself looked legitimate, the URL attached to the document seemed “off” somehow. WATCH: Google apologizes to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco JakeSteam explained If you were to click, you are taken to a legitimate Google screen which will ask you to allow Google Docs to access your Google account. “If I click ‘Google Docs,’ it shows me it’s actually published by a random gmail account, so that user would receive full access to my emails [and could presumably therefore perform password resets etc],” he wrote. The virus then appears to send the email to all of your contacts, and possibly, everyone you have ever contacted. “This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,” said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.

Google warned users that it was looking into phishing e-mails that affected a number of people Wednesday. The e-mails posed as invitations to edit a Google document, but were actually attempts to trick victims into clicking on malicious links. Advertisement The scam appeared to be an attempt to gain access to and partial control of Gmail accounts. In some cases, the invitations appeared to come from someone known to the user, which would make it harder to detect. In a tweet, Google warned users not to click on the e-mailed invitation, and to instead report it through Gmail. We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs.

New Atlas - New Technology & Science News Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Energy Google's Project Sunroof solar calculator spreads to Germany Nick Lavars May 3, 2017 Its debut in Germany marks the first time Project Sunroof has become available outside the US Back in 2015 Google came up with the rather bright idea of using its mapping data to provide home owners with estimates for rooftop solar power yields. The service, dubbed Project Sunroof, has since grown to cover every US state and as of today, is available in Germany too. Project Sunroof first kicked off in a handful of US cities and offered homeowners a way to assess the solar potential of their roofs. Fitting out a rooftop with solar panels isn't a cheap exercise, but Project Sunroof is Google's way of giving homeowners an idea of how much energy savings they can expect following that initial investment. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW It takes aerial images from Google Maps and mixes them with 3D modeling of the roof, along with data on sun position, weather patterns and shade from nearby objects like trees and buildings. It then calculates how many hours of usable sunlight hits the roof, and estimates the possible energy production. Then, based on current solar pricing, it gives an estimate of the cost and savings if the user does go ahead. To bring the service to Germany, the first time it has been available outside the US, Google partnered up with local energy provider E.ON and software company Tetraeder. It already covers around seven million German buildings including urban areas like Munich and Berlin, and by the end of this month the online tool will cover around 40 percent of German homes.

Google's 'Trusted Voice' feature keeps turning off for some users Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/01/08 11:18am PDTJan 8, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 94 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News The OK Google command is great, but I think we'd all agree that it can be a little... temperamental at times. Our Glorious Leader Artem recently took to Google+ to air his grievances about Trusted Voice, the feature that recognizes your voice and unlocks your phone accordingly. What happens when Trusted Voice is off. Specifically, Artem was complaining about Trusted Voice automatically, and seemingly randomly, turning itself off. This is annoying because it means when asking Google Assistant, or Voice Search on non-Pixel phones, the phone has to be manually unlocked before it answers.   Left: as you can see, Trusted Voice is off. Right: the Trusted Voice setup phase. This may be a bug limited to the Google app v6.10 beta, but I've found it happens with versions prior to that on my Nexus 6P. I'll set Trusted Voice up, and it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month - but then one day I'll ask it to play some music or set a timer and it'll say 'I can't do that as your phone needs to be unlocked' or something similar. Rinse and repeat. If Google wants to be the leader in the voice assistant market, it's crucial Assistant works as intended. This means improving the reliability of the OK Google command and ensuring it works 100% of the time. We'd be interested to hear your comments on this, and see if it's related to specific phones or versions of the Google app. Let us know in the comments!

Randomly works at times and other times it simply doesn't. mbarna I've been experiencing this bug on a Nexus 5x throughout the summer of 2016. Haven't seen it crop up recently though. Gonzales It happens on my 5X as well. I was chalking it up to Action Launcher 3 but it still happens with no launcher active. Very frustrating Van_Hammersly Same here. Nexus 5X. Although it happened on Nexus 5 and previous phones as well. Always took a reinstall. Artem Russakovskii Your GIF at least shows the voice prompt and then the lock. With Assistant, you just see the lock, and the voice prompt only shows up after you unlock, which... well, is just as frustrating. Chris Ledbetter Mine on my pixel will show a message saying i have to unlock the device and the prompt is no longer up forcing me to do it all over again. SMH Not a big deal, just something that should be flawless from a search giant... The Fink it happens on Samsung phones as well. Arie Yup, this is happening to me for quite a while.. Nexus 6P, on 7.1.1 blassster This has happened to me before as well, most recently after applying this month's security patch. Anthony McCann Well, on the plus side, at least the voice command was for a good cause Ailín Ó’S This has always happened to me, it's never worked. I have my phone in Irish/Gaeilge and Google in English (Ireland). Goyam Jain This issue has been with me on the Galaxy Su Edge running Android Marshmallow since when I bought it in November. It sucks when it happens JPJ My XL works sporadically and I'm using the Jan update. John Doe Trusted Voice isn't even available on the Nexus 6. I believe it used to be there but I don't know what happened. JasonIvers Did anyone ever find out why the Nexus 6 doesn't have that option? I never did see a reason, just that it was the case. It generally doesn't affect me, as I have trusted devices most places I would actually consider using it. Noeltorious Used to be there, and if you toggled it on it would toggle itself back off. Must've been really broken for them to disable and then remove it digitalcircuit I've had a similar issue where "Say 'Ok Google' any time" keeps turning off a split second after I enable it. Checking logcat points to "AlwaysOnHotword start recognition failed with error 14" and "sound_trigger stdev_load_sound_model failed." Upgrading/downgrading Google Search doesn't help. Frustratingly enough, this was working fine for a month or two on CM 13.. then broke. Then worked again when upgrading to CM 14.1.. then broke a month later. Nexus 6. Logan Snyder I have a 5X, I haven't noticed trusted voice turning off randomly, but I've noticed the "Ok Google command" has a lower and lower recognition rate until it becomes abysmal and almost never recognizes the command. I have to retrain the voice mondel like once a month. chinna_rao I've been having this problem with my device for quite some time but then, it just blew up when I repeatedly tried "OK Google" ing it...Samsung Note 7 matteventu "it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month" You are lucky then. With Pixel XL it happens that you setup the "Ok Google" always on and as trusted voice, and after HOURS it stops responding, forgetting the "vocal-training" you made. And there's no a toggle for this, you have to reinitiate every fu**ing time the vocal setup. Ernie Mine is fine sproc Well at least your fingerprint reader still exists, lol. Some of these issues are like Win9x era crap. ehTuBrutus Happens to me Everytime I switch between user accounts. Gives me a pop-up saying it has been turned off so I took it to be by design. I take it others have it happening even when not switching accounts? I wonder if Artemis has more than one user açcount on his phone? Andrew Palmer I used it to skip a track the other day. I didn't like the next track either so tried to do OK Google again. No response. Joe Mihalich I experienced this twice on the first day I received my pre-ordered Pixel XL. After i retrained it the second time, it hasn't happened again. Lucky me. Now if they would just fix the stupid freeze/lockup issue i can get on with my life. Brian Demodulated Trusted Voice is always turned on for me but often when I give a voice command I'm prompted to unlock my phone before the command is executed. So annoying. whispy_snippet Yep, I experience all of the above on my Pixel. Sucky. shamatuu yep nexus 6P. been turned off on its own for couple of months and yet Google seems to not care to fix it. really hope they fix it ASAP because they not what they used to be. blakeleeper Its happening on my Pixel XL v6.10.33.21 Kwetsima Maluleke Its been doing this to me for ages. About a year maybe. David Hyman Me too but it has been working a lot better for me for a while now Sharondhart Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !ue210c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. It sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it !ue210c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialJobsCash500WebCompanyGetPay$97Hour... ★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★::::::!ue210c:....,...... Les Deplorables Yep...ages here too! Annoying. Michael Gerberich I have a similar issue with Trusted places. It works for a while and then just stops working. S7 Edge. vwnut13 Didn't OK Google used to work with a locked screen? Jimas Happens on my Nexus 6P Google v6.10.33.21. It started happening maybe a week or two ago, but it resets almost like every 2-3 days. Zaptor99 On my Note 4, I don't have Trusted Voices, I have "Personal Results". I turned it on. But If I go to Maps, Settings, Navigation, Ok Google, then the same screen from google app appears, but instead of "Personal Results", I see "Trusted Voice" and it's turned off and it then automatically turns off "Personal Results" in google app. Very confusing. Grey Are we reporting bugs on AP now? Because there are tons of bugs to report, especially with Google Now. It doesn't make sound anymore for one. If your phone is in landscape mode and you get it to turn on, it will turn on then stop because it's in landscape mode and you have to repeat it. Not to mention it does not respond every time. And try saying "remind me tonight dentist appointment at 11 am", cause what it will give you is a reminder for "tonight dentist appointment" due at 11 am. It's got issues. We gonna call them on all of it and try and get some pressure on Google to fix stuff? You gotta do it AP, we can't. Ibrahim Yusuf It happend for me on my nexus 5x on marshmallow, even updating to nougat didn't fix it. But I fixed it by deleting the voice model and retraining again. I got an answer on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/5bgngq/cant_activate_always_on_ok_google_voice_detection/ Amir This is not new. I've been having this issue since the beginning of 2015 on my Nexus 6, 6P and now on Pixel XL. Ive completely given up on that feature. opticalgenesis Same here :( - also bonus points for Muse Himesh Kulkarni Same problem here but works less than a month, maybe like a few days. Also, I don't get any reply, it's just blank (doesn't work). Peter Me: "OK Google" Pixel: "Bleep" Me: "Read last message" Pixel: "You have one last message, would you like to hear it?" Me: "Yes" Pixel: "OK, cool, cool." ... Me: "WTF?" Andre Only once this has happened on my Nexus 5X. I have not experienced this issue in a while. jack_k1 I absolutely loath saying"OK Google". It just doesn't roll off the tongue. I feel like I'm gargling. demarcmj Even if it did "roll off the tongue," four syllables is just way too much. Fatty Bunter Google Home accepts "Hey google" too, which is much better. Hopefully they'll add this to phones too. Cory S Hey Google has a much lower activation rate than Okay Google for me, which is a shame because I hate that hot phrase. jack_k1 Try using Trusted Face when you have a long flowing beard. Hah! nxtiak YES!!! My Pixel XL suffers this issue, so f'ing annoying, I thought I was going crazy! JimOnTheBeach Yes happens on my new LG V20.i thought I was doing something wrong. Shawna Bartron This has never worked for me. LG Stylo 2 Travis James I don't have this issue, but I will keep yelling at my phone when driving "OK Google" with no response. When I have a chance to pick up my phone and unlock, I see that it can't reach Google, even though I have connectivity. Super annoying. Brandon Buchanan I use this feature all the time, but never have trouble with it on my Nexus 5x. King_Android Expect bugs with Beta. Uninstall beta clear data enable using default Google now launcher and all is well. catalysto For as long as I've had my 6P, I've had a similar problem. After a week or so, saying "OK Google" with the screen off stops working. If I toggle the settings off and back on, it works again for a while. But then usually by the time I actually need it, it has stopped working again. I gave up on it and just use the microphone button now for voice commands. Van_Hammersly It's done this to me on at least three separate phones over the past few years. Random and annoying. Each time I think when I get a new phone it'll stop doing it, foolishly. Parneet Singh It always does after few days on my nexus 5 X. Ok google stops responding to voice commands dmo580 That's not the same as Trusted Voice turning off. You're talking about OK Google detection just failing. The screenshots here specifically show the toggle being turned off. Let's not mix up two issues. Yvonne Campbell I have this issue as well, where both the 'trusted voice' and 'detection from any screen' toggles get turned off. gtoninn I have had the same thing happen to me. In addition to that the most recent update to the Google app has left my manually requested google searches with voice (IE I hit the voice search button), getting stuck and then the Google App has to be restarted. Also on a 6P Pyrazol You mention this now? It's been doing that to me for AGES. I thought switching from the Moto X to the Nexus 6 would ease my woes, but nooo. I just don't use that shit anymore because it's so freaking unreliable. dmo580 You don't even have trusted voice on the Nexus 6 as an option in the Google App. Keep in mind this issue is a very specific one regarding trusted voice. Moto's own implementation of always on listening is different as they pay for the license themselves. Cypress Frankenfeld Has anyone logged an issue on the Android bug tracker? I'd gladly star it. Joe Mine's always done this, it just randomly stops working. I always thought it was just because of updates causing it to shut down and needing to be reactivated. sea_hawk I have the same issue for a month. after I joined the 7.1.1 beta and then left the beta, but still experiencing the issue. sea_hawk Never mind... just tried enabling it, and it finally let me do that... not sure what happened. But in the past when I tried enabling trusted voice, it would ask me to input my pattern, but after I do that, the button stays "off"... sorry, not of much help HotRodJohnson Welcome to the world of the Nexus 6 users. The forum for this feature says, Hey Nexus 6 user, you can forget about it! Noeltorious I actually have a similar issue on the Pixel XL. I'll say OK Google and it will wake the screen up and show me the lock screen. Subsequent OK Google's or swiping to launch from the lock screen just point me to use my fingerprint to login. Once I use the fp-sensor the screen unlocks with Assistant launched. Weird and annoying, haven't figured out steps to reproduce because it's so random I don't think it's toggling off though because I never have to toggle anything on to fix it. RecalcitrantOne Just commenting to echo what others have said, happens to me and my 5x. Wouldn't mind being able to set my own "hot phrase." Either way, the emphasis is wrong with "Okay Google." The emphasis is on the second syllable of okay, but first for Google so it's not smooth. Rob I also noticed it deactivated many times, making it unreliable (Nexus 6P 7.1.1). It's been deactivating since the summer but it's a few weeks it hasn't anymore. I hope this gets addressed. Ashlynn This happens for me. Google Pixel version 7.1.1 - Google version 6.10.36.21amd 64. This recently started happening for me. Had no issues a few weeks ago. Chris Tashjian Same here!! It's been resetting on me daily for the last couple weeks jaxjoe Same issue with my PixelXL - was working up until 2-3 weeks ago. Now it doesn't stay turned on for more than a few hours at a time Luke Taylor Ohhhhhh yeah. It'd happened to me only 4 or 5 times on my 6P in the last year, but suddenly in the past two weeks it's happened to me about 6 times- which is how I found this article just now. Come on, Google! stephen Galaxy s7. turns off in middle of voice searches and even while I'm typing in a search. Annoying to have to start typing all over again! Version 6.0.1 Niels Buekers I get this on my Pixel XL since a week or 2.. nikov I've had it happen a few times in the past on my Nexus 6P, but it has become very common in the last month or two. I'm running in to real issues with it at this point. bryguy76 I have a Pixel XL, worked fine for the first month, and then started turning off all the time. It's so annoying. Miguel Dey My pixel just started doing this.. any fix for it yet? Random! LG G3 D855, stock fw. Started happening to me a few days ago. Now this feature freaks out every couple days. Russ We have two Pixels and both do this. It's infuriating. It'll work flawlessly some days and then sometimes we'll say "OK, Google" and just get the lock screen and then go into the settings and find Trusted Voice has turned itself off arbitrarily. Trueblue711 It must be a bug with Google Play services. I'm one of the very few people with a Nexus 6p still running Android 6.0 and this bug happens to me all the time. Ronny Keller Disabling "Battery Optimization" for the item "ok Google enrollment" seems to do the trick for some users. Aaron Kelly I hope this does the trick. I'm trying it. It makes sense. Joe Mihalich This is still happening to me with google app 6.10.37.21. Kris Tyler This is happening at least monthly on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Then it makes me retrain it and opt in. EVERY FREAKING TIME. So annoying, especially when it won't dial numbers when I'm driving. It's enough to make me consider an Apple. Al It happens on Pixel too. I'm starting to wonder if it's anytime the phone restarts. SSt Me too. Nexus 6p Laksamana Just happened to me since last week (Galaxy S6 on Android 6.0.1). Kept asking me to opt back in into Trusted Voice. Andrew Slater I have a 6p on version 7.1.1 and it had been doing this for a month or 2. But instead of it turning off a couple months apart, it turns off after only a couple days. Very annoying. JC Pixel XL, Android 7.1.2, Google App version 6.12.19.21.arm64. Does this multiple times a day, multiple times a week. So annoying it's driving me crazy. Been this this since my Nexus 6P a year ago Austin Ingram So annoying. It stays on for maybe a day or two then it's off again. Austin Ingram It may be related to training it in noisy environments - if you do that then try to activate it when it's quiet it may not recognize your voice and disable it for "security". Ankit Sud It's happening frequently with my Pixel as well. Defeats the biggest use case for Assistant in my opinion. Kyle Bailey Still happening with my Pixel. Is there any fix? bluescrubbie Just spent a while on chat with Google support. They say they've fixed the issue and we'll be rolling it out in an update soon. Patrick Ledwith Really? That's a relief. Garth Hedley I have Nexus 6P and 7.1.1. so fault is not restricted to earlier Android versions. I've set up TV numerous times. Each time after phone locks, Google app voice says can't do that phone is locked. Tatyana Tatyana I turn it on and the same day the "Trusted Voice" option will turn itself off. Drives me fucking bananas. PeterDTown Infuriating! It seems that every time I try to use this feature it's turned off again. Katie Conforti Seems if you don't use your phone for 4 hours the setting gets disabled. So annoying, makes assistant nearly worthless. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en Aaron Kelly My 6p has been doing this for about the last month or two. Every 3-7 days it happens. It's frustrating. I use the Trusted Voice to dial all the time, so when it doesn't work because of something like this, it makes me mad. Shannon Doak It is happening with my Pixel as well. stsin 6P on fi started doing it after I went off the beta os test due to severe battery issues. Dušan Todorović "trusted voice" my ***. After setting it for who knows how many times, yesterday, when i wanted it to start Clash of clans, that annoying answer pulled my nerve with "actually i cant do that while the device is locked, please, unlock blablabla.." for the last time. I disabled it. Guys doing the Ok Google "magic", clearly this is happening for a while and to many people, independant of android version, root opt, device, launcher, gapps version, google+ version, etc. Either fix the darn thing or stop pretending to be Siri's competitor. This sucks big time. Simon Jude I have this exact problem! I'm on an LG K7, anyone actually know how to fix this? Paul Kopalek My Nexus 6P turns the 'Anywhere' feature off INSTANTLY when I turn it on. Even when wiping Google app data, clean flashing the 7.1.1 ROM all over again, and disabling Battery Optimization for 'OK Google Enrollment. This is infuriating. Dave Segal HTC One M8 and galaxy 7 Yvonne Campbell Yes!! It's not just my trusted voice that gets turned off but my detection from any screen. Suddenly I can't just say "ok google" and get a response without touching my phone. Rather defeats the purpose. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Another issue I'm having, but think it would be a phone issue, is that I have answer calls with voice commands turned on, and even though it stays turned on, it does not work anymore. PP Saini I have the opposite issue. The "any time" option will not stay off. I toggle it off, but am immediately able to say OK Google with my phone responding. Check the setting, and it is oddly back on. Kristina Starck Constantly on my Note 5. It also pops up a window asking me what I just said everytime I listen to anything with my headphones plugged in. Even disabling the assistant altogether doesnt stop the spam. Callahan Jason Droid Maxx 2 - used to turn off randomly, more recently I can not keep it on. If I switch it on back out to previous screen then go back-it will be off Salazryl Ismail I have this issue too on my SGS3 and HTC One M8 Jean-Sebastien Penney Same here about once a week Nexus 6p Stapin Does this on an LG KV8 as well. Restarting the phone works, sometimes I have to since the assistant fails to respond even after the phone is manually unlocked Elijah Francis Pixel XL: Voice search keeps shutting off for me shortly after using it. Also the search bar won't even begin to load search results either.... REALLY annoying when you're driving and want search somewhere with a simple voice command. After this bug shows up seemingly immediately I'm forced to restart the phone only for it to happen AGAIN. Google fix this shit. Annduhroo It's started doing this on my Pixel... Not okay at all.

LG G6 already down to $500 at T-Mobile, plus free Google Home and G Pad X tablet Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 11:16am PDTMay 3, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares130 G6 LG News T-Mobile Just the other day we noticed that LG's G6 was $600 at B&H, and now the month-old flagship is down to $500 at T-Mobile. The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H, but, for those of you on the magenta carrier, it is $100 less and comes with a free G Pad X. You can even use it to take advantage of LG's current promo and pick up a Google Home. $500 for a phone, tablet, and Google Home is a pretty sweet deal if the $800 GS8 and its curvy screen doesn't appeal to you. I hope these rapid drops in price aren't a sign of trouble for LG, but in the meantime, they do serve consumers pretty well. The G6 was well regarded in our review. We found the screen to be a pretty great IPS panel if that's your preference. Battery life was also decent, and the size and feel of the phone both struck us well. If you're interested in trying out the future of flagship aspect ratios and rounded screens, the G6 is a decent way to go. The promotion for a free Google Home ($114 right now) sweetens the deal pretty well, too. All these offers have a couple of small caveats you should keep in mind if you're interested in picking up a free Google Home and G Pad X with your G6. For the Google Home you have to order your phone by May 7th, which is just a few days away, and you have to submit your registration for the promo online by the 22nd. The G Pad X requires that you hold a plan through T-Mobile with at least 2GB of data, and keep your service for 24 months. The precise terms and conditions are available at the links below.

Marty Not for a 32GB one these days. A flagship with last gen SoC, no quad DAC and the smallest memory. Simon Are you concerned by this? I'm not sure since you made only 3 comments in 3 minutes about it. Marty Yeah, I don't sound too concerned. But it's a concern. 😉 needa Making my third in three minutes here so you can see my concern also. needa $500 is the right price with those specs. Home is the bonus. Marty Get a Oneplus 3T. 128GB and SD821. Plus it has 6GB RAM. Mine works beautifully. And it's gorgeous. All for $480. needa Yeah but still have the screen and the cameras. I'd buy the 3T in a heartbeat over this. But I don't care that much about the 128. Most I ever had on my 64 OPO over the three years was thirty'ish. Deleted ten gb in roms and was back in action. Mike Not waterproof, much worse camera, update support is a giant question mark, screen is lower quality. One is a true flagship the other is a mid ranger and it shows. Marty What's wrong with the display? Mine's already updated to 7.1.1. And there's a plethora of software options in Beta. And the camera makes beatiful pics. It loads as fast as any Samsung camera. Mike If you're going to talk about current flagship specs, a screen from flagships released, what, two or three years ago doesn't make sense. Also, the OnePlus 2/X still hasn't seen Nougat, OnePlus has yet to prove they can continue with support for older devices. Marty Perfectly fine and beautiful display. It looks better than the display in my Nexus 6P. Bob Marley Except it's not. The pixel density on the OP3T display is effectively the same as the iPhone 7 due to the Pentile subpixel layout. If you have even average vision, the lack of sharpness is apparent, especially on text. Marty It looks gorgeous to me. And quantity isnt quality. needa The OPO ended with the November 2016 security patch. That is all of your fingers and toes, in months, plus a few more. They are lagging behind with the 2/x... no doubt. But they have proven support for older devices. More than some other mainstream OEMs. And with that... I have exceeded my maximum number of comments on a page by about six. See yall later. P. Sherman Sony released Nougat to Xperia Z5 and Z3+. They were released around the same time OnePlus 2 was released. Their attitude to OnePlus 2 and their users is beyond pathetic. needa Not denying they aren't behind. And not denying that they should throw the OP2 users a bone. But you can't use one example and generalize the company. Every single OEM has had their flagship that didn't get updated at a reasonable rate, or updated at all. "The beta test is over". needa hmm. ATT s6 just now getting nougat. I know I know. Oneplus is the worst. They released a new phone only few months after the s6 was released... and It DOesn't HAVe NOUGat YET? Omg. The travesty. Samsung must have been cracking the whip on their 'small team' of developers. tl;dr. It will all be ok. Life will go on. Marty Ohh...by the way, my G5 is on Android 6.0.1 with no sign of any future update. My G4 is on Android 6 and also with no sign of any future update. I'd say LG is worse than any of them for updates. needa 1080 vs 2k isn't about the quality. The 3T has a killer screen. Can't say anything about their support as the OPO that I finally sat down two days ago is still working as good as the day I got it. Just a bit long in the tooth. ie. three years of charging and hindered by the tech back then. Marty Thank you. Exactly. Resolution isn't a factor in quality just like MPs are a factor in picture quality. deibed LOL mike you're a savage, he was feeling all superior with his spec knowledge, and you come and hit him with facts...lol southerndinner Terrible support, never gets updated, incredibly unethical company, no IP rating and poor screen quality. I don't care much for LG but this is a way better deal than the 3T Marty What about my LG G4 and G5 that never get updated? My Oneplus 3T is on Android 7.1.1. The display is gorgeous and better looking than the display in my Nexus 6P. But let me guess, you're one of those people who equates screen quality with pixel resolution? If so, you probably determine a camera's quality based on its pixel count. Jasdeep Singh The S8 effect. LG remains under Samsung's shadow! Marty Because LG makes stupid decisions. Snubbing the American market isn't wise. New_Guy Not to mention they squandered their chance to take over Android the market by constantly putting sub-par cameras in the M-line (4 Ultra Pixels......c'mon man). The only reason I got the Moto X 2014 over the M8 was because of the camera. needa Definitely the new guy. HTC New_Guy Yeah, I was trippin' there for a second....been a long g day already. needa Lol. I hear yah. I have done the same thing before. New_Guy I'd delete the comment, but whatevs.... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Matthew Scott Smith I didn't see a mention of HTC in the above comments, but HTC is doing much worse than LG presently. New_Guy Yeah, I sort of lost myself there for a moment...been a long day, haha ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The S8 trumps the G6. Sammy got LG running like a scalded dog BC LG will eternally be the second and sometimes third best, as their poor choices are constantly going to make their phones less appealing. The gimped USA version had been a nonstarter to me, Smartworld is a POS...I didn't want to deal with that after the LG V20, which even after a factory reset started to become janky. I just wish LG would step up their game and become competition to Samsung. LG needs to freshen up their Android Skin, continue to work on their features and software. BigDeeNY99 exactly why i dont rush anymore to purchase the new next best phone.. Eric Vaughan Also comes with the LG G Pad X 8.0? Seems like a good deal. Marty LG disgusts me. Always skimping for the US market. 32GB max and no quad DAC. balthazar The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H[...] What are the differences? Ryne Hager T-Mobile has a more limited set of frequencies listed for their model, and B&H has the unlocked model that supports a pretty broad range. I can't be sure that the T-Mobile version is locked or unlocked or supports any frequencies outside what T-Mobile lists. Justin W Usually T-Mobile locks their network support. You can temporarily unlock, or permanent unlock, but that depends on your standing with the company. Well, unless this time around is different - the V20 I just picked up has those stipulations in place. Rod Flop much? Sohit will this work on Verizon? Margaritas Ante Porcos Great deal indeed. Although even in my medieval country g6 goes for around $600 bucks. Samsungs will drop s8 prices soon. Only few crazy nerds are buying those phones for 800. Suicide_Note A few thousand buy LG's wares, while millions have already bought the S8/S8+, and I'm sure they're not all 'nerds' as you put it. MRIANB Wow, LG is desperate and phone must not be selling against S8. Ryan Bartz Aside from the iPhone no phone can compete with Samsung. Samsung releases a respectable phone with half backed software (nothing has changed) and people forget about LG which is a damn good no gimmick phone Martin Watched couple videos on YouTube and the phone is pretty damn good. And this deal is pretty sweet. Wish I was in US... Here butt naked G6 is $650.... :) TechGuy22 299 and i'd buy it Marty Same for me. At that price point, not having the quad DAC and the small memory doesn't hurt too bad. sebastianer If they are powered with random bootlooping technology… I'm totally in. Arysyn While I'm not a fan of the LG G6, this isn't a bad price, especially for what is included. It would be an even better deal if priced to go against the ZTE Axon 7, as the G6 still is a much better device, despite the features I think LG ought to have included in the G6. JD At this rate you might as well just get right to where the G6 will end up. You get a free boot-looping G6 with the purchase of every Google Home. Mike The Galaxy S8 forced the markdown J_Grouchy The "free" tablet ($240 value) requires a $10/month data plan for 24 months. Funny how that math works... Mike in KC Now throw in a BOGO deal on top of that price and I'm in. southerndinner LOL in the bargain bin already RIP LG Mobile PhillipeFelut the V20 and G6 are 50% off on at&t next as well fyi DroidBlaze I'm still liking my s7e but if the US g6 had 64gb and the quad dac I would have seriously considered getting it. As is, the US g6 is just meh. calvini Just got the G6 from AT&T for $360 with the free tablet and I also had the option of getting the LG Smart watch for $50. Registered on LGs website to get the free Google home as well. I believe this promo lasts this whole month, but to be eligible for the Google home, you need to purchase the phone before the 7th of May. Not a bad deal at all through AT&T.

Google said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. "This is the future of phishing," said Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc. "It gets attackers to their goal ... without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device." He said the hackers had also pointed some users to another site, since taken down, that sought to capture their passwords. Google said its abuse team "is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again." Anybody who granted access to the malicious app unknowingly also gave hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. "This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party," said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data.

clock menu more-arrow Longform How to print a house ‘Everybody's dream is you hit the button and boom, your house pops out’ by Andrew Zaleski May 3, 2017, 10:00am EDT Courtesy of WATG tweet share pin At home late one night, an energy drink in one hand, the 3Doodler pen in the other, Platt Boyd had his breakthrough. Like hot glue from a gun, the molten plastic secreted by the 3Doodler hardens as it cools, which allows the user to draw 3D shapes. Boyd drew a small scaffold, an object that crudely represented the three-dimensional diagrams of compounds a high school student might study in chemistry class. When it solidified, he set one book on top of it. Then another, and another. Eventually the tiny 3D object he had created minutes before was holding up 18 pounds of books. It weighed half an ounce. At the time, Boyd was a partner at a regional architecture firm based in Birmingham, Alabama, doing what everyday architects do: dreaming up boundary-stretching designs without a shot at ever seeing them built. “What I as an architect wanted to have was the freedom to design things like all these starchitects,” he says. “All of these normal architects are frustrated because the building technology isn’t there to realize it unless you have these huge budgets.” Using normal building materials, the sort of design freedom Boyd wanted could cost between $800 and $1,000 a square foot, by his own estimate, or even more. But that night in 2014, doodling with a children’s toy, Boyd saw a way to make the designs in his head a reality. Boyd envisioned a 3Doodler pen on a massive scale. Constructing a free-form house with such a machine would drop costs to around $200 a square foot, he figured. In April 2014, Boyd left the firm he had been with for 15 years and founded Branch Technology, one of the latest in a string of companies worldwide racing to upend the construction industry using 3D printing. The house Apis Cor built last December cost just over $10,000. By comparison, a three-bedroom, 1,050-square-foot house built by Habitat for Humanity costs roughly $50,000. The concept of additive manufacturing—the more technical term for 3D printing—dates back to the 1980s but has become much more popular in the last decade, thanks to companies, such as Brooklyn-based MakerBot, that shrunk the necessary hardware so that it could fit on a desktop. Using powdered metals or plastic, a 3D printer employs heat and force to fuse together materials, layer by layer, until a fully 3D-printed object is created. In recent years, companies in a variety of industries have turned to 3D printing to streamline manufacturing processes and produce parts, like fuel nozzles for airplane engines and dental implants. Now 3D printing is making its way into single-family home construction. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, named 3D-printed construction one of the next moon shots at last year’s Milken Global Conference. Instead of powdered metals and plastic, mixtures of cement, sand, and plastic-polymers are the building materials. Instead of stationary, box-like machines, large robotic arms on a swivel produce fully functional houses, with electricity, plumbing, roofs, and windows. 3D Printed Tiny House The trifecta: a 3D-printed tiny house that's only $10k.Posted by Curbed on Wednesday, May 3, 2017 In December, Apis Cor, a startup with offices in San Francisco and Russia, printed what it claims is the world’s first “on-site” house outside Moscow. In 24 hours, the company used a cement printer to construct a 400-square-foot house. Elsewhere abroad, other entrepreneurs, architects, and firms are constructing houses and buildings using 3D printing. Dutch firm Dus Architects spearheaded work three years ago on a 3D-printed, full-size canal house to demonstrate the capabilities of 3D printing for construction; it followed that up last summer by printing an 86-square-foot cabin in Amsterdam out of recyclable bioplastic. In the United Arab Emirates, a $140,000, 2,700-square-foot open office made of concrete and designed by international architectural firm Gensler was unveiled last May. In China, the company WinSun has made 3D printing a step in a prefabrication process to print, using a mixture of cement, sand, and some other substances, walls and other pieces off-site that are then assembled into buildings. And, of course, there’s Enrico Dini, an Italian civil engineer and the inventor of the D-Shape, a massive 3D printer capable of printing entire houses. Many of today’s efforts to make 3D-printed construction a reality owe their efforts to the work Dini did during the late 2000s. Pioneers of 3D-printed construction rattle off what they see as numerous advantages: decreased costs and the consequent ability to follow through on their inventive architectural plans, as well as simpler and sturdier houses built more quickly. The price is lower for homebuyers, too. The house Apis Cor built last December cost just over $10,000. By comparison, a three-bedroom, 1,050-square-foot house built by Habitat for Humanity costs roughly $50,000. The Apis Cor house being constructed. Courtesy of Apis Cor The house built by Apis Cor. Courtesy of Apis Cor Even if 3D-printed home construction is the wave of the future, barriers remain. Testing the materials and the equipment to print them is an expensive process. Materials must, to comply with existing regulations, be fire retardant and offer UV protection. Not to mention that the construction industry is slow to change, especially in the U.S., where framed wooden houses have been the norm for decades. “All of these convergences take a long time sometimes,” says Cindy Frewen, Kansas City-based architect and chair of the Association of Professional Futurists. “Right now these 3D-printed homes are just demonstrations more than a trend. But I think a new era is coming.” This year could be a tipping point for the start of widespread 3D-printed home construction in the U.S. People at the vanguard of 3D-printed construction plan to roll out construction machines and build 3D-printed homes this year. And by the end of 2017, Boyd hopes to finish an 800-square-foot home in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where his new company has its headquarters. Two years ago, Branch sponsored a contest for architects, with a $10,000 prize, to design a 3D-printed house using the company’s technology. The winning house, dubbed Curve Appeal, was designed by the Chicago-based Urban Architecture Studio of WATG, an internationally acclaimed architecture firm founded in 1945. In 20 or even 10 years, the house that now takes weeks to build might be done in a matter of days. “Everybody’s dream is you hit the button and boom, your house pops out, and it’s ready to live in,” says Chris Hurst, one of the designers of Curve Appeal. “That’s the market, and it’s something we can do relatively soon.” Engineering professor Behrokh Khoshnevis was an early pioneer of house printing, sometimes referred to as its grandfather. Khoshnevis, director of the Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies at the University of Southern California, began experimenting with 3D-printed construction as early as 1996. Over time, he developed what he calls Contour Crafting, a building method that makes use of a large, computer-guided robotic gantry outfitted with nozzles. The machine follows the outline of a house; from foundation up, it deposits a concrete mixture layer after layer until a roof is ready to be placed on top. Walls are hollow to allow for the conduits needed to install electricity, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning. The goal, he says, is full automation of home construction. “It’s going to be cheaper, faster, more consistent, and less hazardous to humans,” says Khoshnevis, citing statistics from the International Labor Organization that place the number of deaths at construction sites worldwide at 60,000 each year. He recently founded Contour Crafting Corporation, which plans to start selling an entry-level version of his Contour Crafting machine to contractors in late 2017. The plan is for his company to operate the machines for contractors, and then eventually offer training on the machines so contractors can use them on their own. Branch Technology, on the other hand, uses a process more akin to prefabrication. The company currently has three hulking robotic arms in its downtown Chattanooga studio. Affixed to each arm is an extruder head that pushes out 3D-printed material. Those robotic arms assemble systems of matrices: cross-hatched, three-dimensional patterns of hardened material. One such arm is a 12-and-a-half-foot machine that travels along a rail on the ground and is able to print a matrix that’s 25 feet wide and 58 feet long. Stand up enough of these matrices and you have the frame of a house. The concept is derived directly from Boyd’s time messing with a 3Doodler. After he built that first tiny matrix, he took a trip to Home Depot for supplies—a pipe, an auger bit, some portable heaters—to rig up a prototype of Branch’s system. Using it, Boyd printed a 2-ounce piece that held his weight, 160 pounds. After testing materials and build density, Boyd eventually printed a 2-pound matrix. It was made from carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic and, once it was reinforced with spray foam insulation, held 6,000 pounds. “Right now these 3D-printed homes are just demonstrations more than a trend. But I think a new era is coming.”—Cindy Frewen, architect and chair of the Association of Professional Futurists “We’ve developed the hardware and the software to free-form 3D print so that it solidifies in open air,” says Boyd. “We prefabricate those frames, and then ship them, and then fit them together like Legos on-site.” Today the robotic arms are supplied by companies that specialize in automation, but the concept is the same. Curve Appeal, in part, will be constructed this way. The exterior and interior walls as well as the roof, and maybe some of the furniture, will be 3D printed by Branch. The rest of the house is something that could be plucked from your own home. While Khoshnevis is going to contractors with a machine and Boyd begins house construction this summer, Minneapolis-based Andrey Rudenko plans to print several houses this year on his own as a way to prove the technology works. He says by the end of 2017, there will be three houses made from 3D-printed construction: one in California, one in Florida, and one in his home state of Minnesota. “I can print any shape, and it takes two or three days to print a house. At the same time we are installing electricity, wires, plumbing—everything,” he says, as opposed to the usual approach of running all the wiring and plumbing after the house is framed. “They are going to be gorgeous houses with contemporary design.” Rudenko has been in the construction business since he was 16 years old. An engineer and architect originally from Russia, he was a contractor near Moscow, building houses, nightclubs, and restaurants, before he immigrated to the U.S. Rudenko’s name first hit the online 3D printing trade publications in 2015 when he built a 3D-printed castle in his backyard, using a machine he developed that operates similarly to the robotic gantry used in Contour Crafting. The castle, built from a mixture of fine concrete, plus some other additives, was constructed layer by layer, just like a 3D-printed Yoda head that comes out of a desktop 3D printer. Rudenko knew the same technology could be applied to building houses, and his experience in the construction industry is what spurred him to develop newer versions of his original machine. “The reason I started using 3D printers is because I clearly saw the construction technology was really outdated,” he says. “We are going to Mars, everybody has smart phones, but in construction, it’s the same as it was 50 years ago.” A robotic arm machine in the Branch Technology studio. Courtesy of Branch Technology Courtesy of WATG There are reasons for the slow place, some economic, some rooted in safety. Both will prove to be challenges as developers of 3D-printing construction technology move forward. The home industry usually thinks in terms of 30 years or more, says Peter Ebner, an architecture and urban design professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. A contractor who has been building wooden houses for years isn’t going to suddenly adopt a new means of building residences, even if people like Rudenko and Khoshnevis say it could cut costs by as much as 30 percent. Testing the durability of 3D-printing materials is also a tedious and expensive process. Right now, Branch is trying a variety of building materials—plastic polymers reinforced with carbon fiber and glass, as well as some biopolymers—paid for by a $750,000 grant from the National Science Foundation. “In Germany, for example, you have to get a certificate to show that building material will last 30 years or longer. How do you prove it with a new structure?” says Ebner, who worked as an engineer in Austria and Germany before heading to UCLA in 2009. He has his own experience comparing conventional and 3D-printed construction. In 2014, he and a group of students created a 3D-printed, 50-square-foot micro-house at UCLA’s 3M futureLAB, named after the Minnesota company better known for Post-It notes and Scotch tape. Additionally, the construction business overall is big, expensive, and custom, three factors that make an industry loath to change. “There’s an innovation gap going on, and a need for some real, new ideas. But construction in general is very behind the times,” Frewen says. It also knows what works, and what’s permitted—especially when it comes to residential buildings, and especially in the U.S.—and doesn’t need to run a gauntlet of local and state code officials to get approval for a new construction method. “Everybody’s dream is you hit the button and boom, your house pops out, and it’s ready to live in. That’s the market, and it’s something we can do relatively soon.”—Chris Hurst, one of the designers of Curve Appeal “As long as it’s conventional construction, if you’re using wood or steel like normal, I don’t need any plans,” says John Haustein, a plans review specialist with the city government of Chattanooga, where Boyd’s Curve Appeal home is to be built. “If you’re doing something innovative, I need to see building plans. Then I’m going to need some engineering to show that it will hold up to 90-mile-an-hour winds and a 10-pound snow load on the roof.” And those standards, for obvious reasons, are not uniform across the U.S. “Within the U.S., there’s no one set of codes or regulations that apply everywhere. There are differences regionally,” says WATG’s Miguel Alvarez. “And for a lot of difficult assemblies, they’re all known quantities and there’s a whole knowledge base that’s readily applied to those constructions. That doesn’t exist for 3D printing.” Local and state building codes in the U.S. work from standards established in the International Building Code and the International Residential Code, both of which fall under the purview of the International Code Council, which provides technical support to government agencies that oversee building codes. To prepare for 3D-printed construction, the ICC partnered with America Makes, the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute, and the American National Standards Institute to put together a standardization roadmap for 3D printing across major industries, including construction, that just published in February. When these standards are finalized in the next couple years, the ICC plans to use them to create a regulatory framework around 3D-printed construction, according to CEO Dominic Sims. “The IBC is at the core of our plans to modernize the International Codes in preparation for additive manufacturing,” Sims told Curbed by email. Assuming the regulatory structure in the U.S. is worked out sooner than later, there’s one last hurdle Khoshnevis, Rudenko, and other aspiring printers of homes will have to jump: Who wants to live in a tiny, 3D-printed house made of concrete? For now, because of the size of the machines, there are limitations to what can be built, as well as questions around the visual aesthetic that a 3D-printed house can achieve. “Right now, this is not very elegant, and there’s a lot to be said about quality… It’s a long way before you could say it’s the same as customized housing,” Frewen says. The purveyors of 3D-printed construction dispute the notion that a 3D-printed house, even a concrete one, is ugly or unappealing. Branch’s method, for instance, was recently used by the New York-based firm SHoP Architects to create a 200-by-100-foot outdoor pavilion for Art Basel. SHoP designed the lattice-like pavilion, and Branch created it out of 3D-printed biodegradable bamboo. The pavilion was the winner of the Design Miami fair’s Visionary Award.

Courtesy of Branch Technology And the companies developing 3D-printing construction technology are doing so with an eye toward building two-, three-, even four-story homes, or larger single-story houses. One company, Sunconomy, plans to use Apis Cor’s printer to build houses in Montgomery, Texas, and is advertising floorplans with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Still, sometimes it’s easier to build outside the U.S. Rudenko plans to build just a few 3D-printed houses here, but is in the beginnings of a master plan to print 10,000 houses in Russia. “The whole industry here works toward building framed houses, wood houses. It just takes too much time and energy to discuss how we can switch to concrete,” he says. “It’s actually much easier to print in Asia and Europe, because they’re used to using concrete for traditional houses.” While Branch Technology doesn’t print in concrete, the hope is that Curve Appeal will start winning over converts from the construction industry. As designed, the house is a winding, curvy residence replete with archways, something even a concrete printer is capable of building, with few of the sharp angles common in conventional home construction. “If you Google ‘parametric architecture,’ you’ll see all these amazing designs in the computer. Hardly any of them are built because it costs so much,” says Boyd. “Well, now, through 3D printing, those things can be realized. It enables really a more beautiful architecture.” And that’s the point, Boyd says—to demonstrate that, with 3D-printing technology, even everyday architects or homebuyers on a budget can afford not only a house, but also one that’s unlike any other on the block.

Though the hackers were able to access and use the affected users’ contact information, the company’s investigation determined no personal emails or other data have been exposed. The widespread scam involved emails inviting recipients to open a Google Doc, which, if opened, allowed hackers to gain access to recipients’ Google accounts. The scam replicated itself by sending the same link to users’ contacts. The emails, sent by hackers, were disguised to look as if they were sent from legitimate university email accounts — a practice known as “spoofing.” The scam emails were widely reported Wednesday afternoon, including at universities and major media organizations. Information technology experts said the scam was nearly impossible to detect, because it contained a real Google link and did not contain red flags, like spelling or formatting errors. In a statement posted to Twitter at 1:08 p.m., Google said it was investigating the scam and advised users not to open any unexpected Google invitations and to report any scam emails they receive. To shut down the scam, Google worked to remove the fraudulent pages and applications and to disable the responsible Google accounts. The company updated its security features after the campaign and said it is working to prevent similar scams in the future. The purpose of the scam remains unclear. Users initially feared the hackers would be capable of accessing the victims’ emails or revoking the victim’s access to their own account by changing the password, before Google’s investigation discovered this was not the case, according to a Reddit threat discussing the scam shortly after it was discovered. People affected by the scam were initially advised to revoke permissions for the false Google Docs program by accessing their account security settings. Google said Wednesday evening that no further action by users was necessary. This post will be updated as more information becomes available. Have a reaction to this article?

The Surface laptop runs on the Windows 10 S operating system, featuring an Intel Core 7th generation processor, 14.5 hours of battery life, a 13.5 inch PixelSense display, optically bonded Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and a keyboard covered in Alcantara material. The Surface is available in four colors: platinum, graphite gold, cobalt blue and burgundy. It will sell for US$999. Microsoft has begun taking preorders for the Surface laptop, which will be available June 15 in 20 countries, including the U.S. and the UK. The Surface will be available online at the Microsoft Store and at BestBuy.com. The laptop will be available in Canada and China later this year. Microsoft will make Windows 10 S PCs available to students and teachers starting at $189 and bundled with a free one-year subscription to Minecraft: Education Edition; Windows 10 S will be free for schools with Windows Pro PCs. It will offer a free trial of Microsoft Intune for Education, free Office 365 for Education with Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft 365 for education. Late to the Party Microsoft's product launch comes late in the game. Apple initially carved out a niche in education, and Google made its Chromebook devices a centerpiece of its effort to loosen Apple's grip. Microsoft appears confident there's room for one more, however, and it aims to help schools use Windows 10 and Surface to prepare students for the collaborative workforce of the future. "We are under no illusion that technology alone is the answer to transforming education," CEO Satya Nadella told attendees at the Microsoft Education event in New York City, noting that dedicated administrators, great teachers, motivated students and involved parents are at the forefront of building a great education system. "Technology is merely a tool to empower their creativity and their ingenuity." Terry Myerson, vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, introduced the new operating system, which is a stripped down version of the Windows 10 OS. Applications that run on the new OS are downloaded from the Windows Store to a safe "container," and the full Office 365 suite -- including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and other apps -- will be coming to the Windows Store. Specialized lesson plans, including lessons for STEM and a full range of peripherals, such as mixed-reality headsets, will be available to work with the OS, Myerson noted. Partners including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung and Toshiba are offering compatible PCs, starting at $189, and they will offer a full range of touchscreen devices and peripherals, as well as Windows Ink, which can be used for on-screen note-taking. Microsoft plans to host STEM Saturdays during the month of May, featuring pop-up STEM classrooms, at Windows Stores in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and Australia. The company also introduced a feature for Windows 10 called "View Mixed Reality," which allows users to see 3D content move from the screen into the real world as mixed reality, thanks to an RGB Camera. Microsoft announced a partnership with Pearson, one of the world's largest educational firms, to integrate 3D and mixed reality into secondary and university education curricula. By 2018, Pearson will feature health, commerce, history and STEM-related curricula on Windows Mixed Reality devices. Chromebook Dominance "This is definitely an education play," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "Most of the features are geared towards the non-power or application specific user," he told the E-Commerce Times. It's noteworthy that Microsoft's announcement comes three months after Google announced the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 and the Asus Chromebook C213 at the annual Bett conference, one of the world's largest educational technology conferences. Chromebook has taken the lion's share of the K-12 education market in recent years. iPads also have been widely used, but Windows adoption as an operating system for that segment of the market has lagged. "The Windows 10 S strategy is interesting," said Jim McGregor, a principal analyst at Tirias Research. "It is targeted at heading off the growing threat from Chromebooks," he told the E-Commerce Times. Chromebooks struggled early on to compete in the enterprise and consumer markets against full-fledged personal computers. They have gained traction in the education space, though, in part due to their lower cost and also due to their appeal as a mobile operating system already familiar to younger consumers. Google estimates that more than 20 million students and teachers use Chromebook. Chromebook dominated the U.S. mobile PC market for the K-12 segment in 2016, with 58 percent of market, according to Futuresource. However, outside the United States, the market is far less settled, and it's still very much anyone's game. David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

According to online reports — in particular, a detailed user thread on Reddit — clicking on an emailed share link, purportedly from a known source, was taking users to a site that asked permission for a fake app calling itself “Google Docs” to access their accounts. If they agreed, the app would then send additional copies of the original email to the users’ contacts. Earlier reports suggested the attack was a phishing scam potentially aimed at harvesting personal information and maybe even Google login credentials. But in a statement late Wednesday, Google said that while the campaign accessed and used contact information, no other data was apparently exposed. Google said it was able to stop the campaign in about an hour. It has disabled offending accounts, removed fake pages and updated its Safe Browsing feature, which issues warnings when users visit dangerous sites. Users don’t have to take additional action, although Google encouraged those who want to be extra safe to run its security check feature. One telltale sign for identifying the spam email: It appears to be directed to the address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com, and is only blind copied to the recipient.

A nasty phishing scam that impersonates a Google Docs request has swept the internet today, including a decent chunk of media companies. You’ve heard “think before you click” a million times, but it really could save you from a whole lot of hassle. Google has taken steps to neutralize this particular phish. The company said in a statement that it has “disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” But when it comes to phishing defense there’s always an element of cat and mouse. Large-scale phishing attacks and those impersonating popular services like Google log-in pages regularly stalk the internet. “The importance of this phish is not how it spread, but rather how it didn’t use malware or fake websites tricking users to give up their passwords,” says Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at the phishing research and defense company PhishMe, which analyzed data from the fake Google Docs campaign. “This phish worked because it tricked the user into granting permissions to a third-party application. This is the future of phishing, and every security technology vendor is ill-equipped to deal with it.” Go Phish Lily Hay Newman Sneaky Exploit Allows Phishing Attacks From Sites That Look Secure Lily Hay Newman Phishing Scams Even Fool Tech Nerds—Here’s How to Avoid Them Brian Barrett How to Stop Services Like Unroll.me From Snooping on Your Gmail Similar Google Docs scams in particular have been circulating since at least 2014, but that doesn’t make them any easier to spot, in part because they seem so authentic. Phishers can use real Google accounts and develop third-party plugins that can interact with Google services, so they can lure victims in through the most perfect-looking Google web pages of all: Genuine ones. And variations on this approach hit over and over, much like waves in the ocean. Fishing? Phishing. You get it. Here’s how to stay vigilant this time, and going forward. Trust Fall This round of Google docs phishing emails works like so: You get an email saying someone added you to a Google Doc; click this link to view it. That takes you to a legitimate account screen, listing all the Google accounts you’re logged into. From there, you choose the one you want to use to view the document (or log in, if you weren’t already authenticated in your browser). There, a malicious service called “Google Docs” awaits, asking for privileges to access your account, your contacts, your password rests, your emails, everything. If you already clicked this type of link today (or any day), go to the Permissions page of your Google account as quickly as possible and, in this case, revoke access to the service called “Google Docs.” Again, it’s a fake. Then change your password and make sure you have two-factor authentication turned on, which you totally already did, right? Wired Safety First To help protect yourself even further in the future, Google offers a tool called Password Alert that warns you if you type your Google account credentials into any page that isn’t officially Google’s. If phishers have made a realistic-looking fake, Password Alert instantly suggests that you change your password and secure your account as soon as you’ve made the mistake. But this doesn’t necessarily protect you when scammers are manipulating genuine Google processes. And, of course, it doesn’t help you identify fake log-in pages related to other companies’ services. Resisting the urge to click remains the best first line of defense out there. When you can spot inconsistencies or suspicious content in an email that may help tip you off—in this case, a “To:” field populated by “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh” should raise suspicions—and listening to those instincts is important. But in the case where a phishing email (or a spear phishing email tailored to you) is perfect enough to convince you, it takes a general habit of thinking before you click to give you a chance. Downloading attachments or clicking links shouldn’t be automatic even when they seem to be from the people closest to you. Particularly if you’re not expecting a message, you should take a moment to examine any URLs it contains in a plaintext editor, or double-check with your friend through another means of communication that they really sent you a Word document of recipes. These quick checks can make a big difference. Sometimes a second look is all it takes to realize that your coworker probably wouldn’t send a Google Doc to your entire company out of the blue.

PSA: This Google Doc scam is spreading fast and will email everyone you know Posted 11 hours ago by Greg Kumparak (@grg) 0 SHARES Next Story Inside DevMountain’s sweet code school A new Google Docs phishing scam just reared its head a few hours ago, and it’s spreading like wildfire. Google appears to be taking action to stop it, but in the meantime: be super, super wary of Google Doc invites for now. If you fall for this one (and plenty of otherwise eagle-eyed people have already), it’ll blast out the bait to everyone on your contact list. Here’s what you need to know: Clicking the link takes you to a real Google-hosted page, with a list of your Google accounts ready to click It asks you to select an account and provide an app called “Google Docs” — yes, they were somehow allowed to name a third-party app “Google Docs” — with account permissions As soon as you click the “ALLOW” button, this not-at-all-actually-Google Docs app now has permission to read your emails and email all your contacts… the latter of which it’ll start doing pretty much immediately, spreading the worm to pretty much everyone you’ve ever emailed. This one is super sneaky; pretty much the only way to detect it before falling for it is to click the small “Google Docs” link on the actual Google-hosted page and notice that the developer info seems… off. Zach Latta of Hack Club grabbed a video of the whole flow so you don’t have to test fate to see it for yourself: @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 How do I know if I’ve been hit? How do I fix it? Check your Google account’s app permissions. There should not be an app called “Google Docs” there — actual Google Docs has access to your account by default. If you see it listed there, remove it by tapping the label and hitting “Remove” Update: The Google Docs Twitter account just acknowledged the attack and says they’re working on it, but says not to click on things in the meantime. We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail. — Google Docs (@googledocs) May 3, 2017 Update: Google says this specific attack should be blocked now, and they’re working on preventing similar attacks moving forward. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Gmail Description Gmail is Google's free email service.
