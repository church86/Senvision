International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Google's Pixel(2017) series phones tipped to come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU Google's 2017 series Pixel 2 (aka Muskie), Pixel XL 2 (aka Walleye) and the Pixel XXL (aka Taimen) are expected to have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core seen in the Galaxy S8 series. Rohit KVN   April 25, 2017 11:22 IST [Representational Image] Google’s Pixel series phones tipped to have Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU. In Picture: Google Pixel XLRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google was said to have commenced work on the 2017-series phones — 5.0-inch Pixel 2 (aka Muskie), the 5.5-inch Pixel XL 2 (aka Walleye) and the 6.0-inch plus Pixel XXL (aka Taimen). It has now come to light that all the three variants will have one common key hardware. Source code (courtesy, WinFuture) on Google's Android Open Project (ASOP) has surfaced online, revealing that all the three Pixel phones will run on the 'MSM8998' processor, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 octa-core, as seen in Samsung Galaxy S8 series.

Last year, the first generation Pixel and the Pixel XL came with Snapdragon 821, a slightly upgraded version of Snapdragon 820 seen in the flagship devices launched in the first half of the year. So many hoped that Google would follow the same plan for the 2017 series models. Though there are no confirmed reports, we believe Qualcomm might not launch any upgraded version of the Snapdragon 835 series and instead focus on next year's 845 series. A report emerged just hours ago that Samsung has already initiated talks with Qualcomm about incorporating next-gen Snapdragon 845 for its Galaxy S9 series in 2018. The 845 series chipset is expected to be mass-produced by Taiwan's TSMC once the development is completed. Coming back to the topic at hand, the second generation Google Pixel series phones are expected to come with enhanced camera, RAM and battery capacity, in addition to the Snapdragon 835 processor. It is also expected to come with improved design language. However, Google might dump the 3.5mm audio jack port and use a single Type C port for both charging and audio jack. There are chances that Google may make last-minute changes, since it has a lot of time on its hands to test prototypes. The new phones are slated for October launch and the company will give a nod to its supply partner for mass production around two months before the date of unveiling. Like last year, HTC is said to be Google's main contractor to make 2017 Pixel series phones. Watch this space for latest news on Google Pixel 2 series.

The new update lets you take advantage of AirPlay for the purpose of throwing photos and videos up to your big screen. This way, you dont have to crowd around a small screen to view those vacation photos you took with your DSLR that were uploaded to Google Photos. Assuming it works like it does on Chromecast, youll be able to cast a photo or video using Airplay and search for the next one on your device. That way your librarys thumbnails arent put on display. Googles efforts to improve and update its Photos app have showed. It has pushed many updates to the app suite including an update to Google PhotoScan to remove glare, improved sharing on devices with slower connections, and the most recent update to Google Photos UI makes it easier to see where the on-device folders are. The update is now live on the App Store or iTunes, so go check it out!

Google unveils new YI HALO VR camera for their Jump platform Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/24 11:16am PDTApr 24, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares104 Cardboard Google News VR Back in 2015 at I/O, and just after announcing Cardboard, Google rolled out Jump. At the time the hardware that accompanied it was the GoPro Odyssey, a big circular contraption containing 16 GoPro cameras. It was meant to make recording in 360 degrees for VR purposes a bit easier, both logistically and in terms of the tools and software needed. Don't be too surprised if that flew under your radar at the time; there hasn't been much in the way of news from Google about Jump since then (though there was a cool WebVR film announced a few days ago that used it). It seems that the platform has come due for a hardware upgrade, though, as today Google has announced the YI HALO as well as a new Jump Start program for free access to the cameras and software. The original GoPro Odyssey took more than a year to arrive after being announced at I/O. Even then it never went up for general sale, requiring registration and approval for "select industry professionals" before you could plop down the $15K for it. It remains to be seen if the YI HALO will suffer the same exclusivity concerns, but with more than one option available to use Google's Jump Assembler tech at least there's some choice. It also looks like the YI HALO will be a whole lot more advanced than its GoPro forebear. It features a 100 minute battery, additional resolution options (8K @ 30FPS, or 5.7K @ 60FPS), a lighter and more ruggedized design, a built-in control interface, and Wi-Fi based control and preview via an app as well as a separate Bluetooth remote. The tech behind how Jump stitches the images together is pretty cool, but it's even cooler seeing it in action. With the new Jump Start program aspiring directors and filmmakers will have easier and cheaper access to the tech as well, so we might see more high-quality media made using the format in the future. Those who are interested can sign up now for more info. According to the manufacturer it should be available sometime late this summer .

Read More WASHINGTON: A Silicon Valley "flying car" startup, Kitty Hawk, reportedly backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, released a video on Monday of its airborne prototype and announced plans for deliveries of a "personal flying machine" this year. "Our mission is to make the dream of personal flight a reality. We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them," said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google's home town of Mountain View, California. "Today we're announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017." The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and fly at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (40 kph). and can hover at 15 feet (4.5 meters) high. The company describes the Flyer as "a new, all-electric aircraft," which is "safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas" under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot's license is required, and two hours' training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google's self-driving car, tweeted: "Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype." The company announced it was offering three-year "memberships" for $100 to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. The startup offered only limited details about the company. An email response to an AFP query said the lead engineers were Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, who created a startup called Aerovelo which aims to produce the fastest human-powered vehicle. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. A blog post by writer Cimeron Morrissey, who took the flyer for a test run, offered some clues on how it feels. "The prototype looks and feels a lot like a flying motorcycle. You mount the seat and lean forward, just like you would on a bike," she wrote. Read this story in Bengali "I feel light and ecstatic and utterly free. This is just like my flying dreams!" Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines. Meet AeroMobil's flying car, available for pre-order soon Slovakian company AeroMobil's will be available to preorder as soon as this year but is not for everyone: besides the big price tag - between $1.3 million-$1.6 million - you'd need a pilot's license to use it in the air. It has a range of about 100 km and a top speed of 160 kph. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

"Our mission is to make the dream of personal flight a reality. We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them," said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google's home town of Mountain View, California. "Today we're announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017." The video showed the single-seat aircraft - with two pontoons and a spider web-like platform - taking off from a lake at an undisclosed location and hovering above the water, where it is meant to be used. The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and fly at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (40 kph). and can hover at 15 feet (4.5 meters) high. The company describes the Flyer as "a new, all-electric aircraft," which is "safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas" under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot's license is required, and two hours' training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google's self-driving car, tweeted: "Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype." The company announced it was offering three-year "memberships" for $100 to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. The startup offered only limited details about the company. An email response to an AFP query said the lead engineers were Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, who created a startup called Aerovelo which aims to produce the fastest human-powered vehicle. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. A blog post by writer Cimeron Morrissey, who took the flyer for a test run, offered some clues on how it feels. "The prototype looks and feels a lot like a flying motorcycle. You mount the seat and lean forward, just like you would on a bike," she wrote. "I feel light and ecstatic and utterly free. This is just like my flying dreams!" Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines.

Gravity is, after all, a formidable adversary. List your Business on Economictimes.com for Free & Grow your Business List Your Business Find Service Near You By John Markoff CLEARLAKE: On a recent afternoon, an aerospace engineer working for a small Silicon Valley company called Kitty Hawk piloted a flying car above a scenic lake about 100 miles north of San Francisco. Kitty Hawk's flying car, if you insisted on calling it a "car," looked like something Luke Skywalker would have built out of spare parts. It was an open-seated, 220-pound contraption with room for one person, powered by eight battery-powered propellers that howled as loudly as a speedboat. The tech industry is fond of disrupting things, and lately the automakers have been a big target. Cars that use artificial intelligence to drive themselves, for example, have been in development for a few years and can be spotted on roads in a number of cities. And now, coming onto the radar screen, are flying machines that do not exactly look like your father's Buick with wings. More than a dozen startups backed by deep-pocketed industry figures like Larry Page, a Google founder - along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, the ride-hailing company Uber and even the government of Dubai - are taking on the dream of the flying car. The approaches by the companies vary and the realization of their competing visions seems far in the future, but they have one thing in common: a belief that one day regular people should be able to fly their own vehicles around town. There are challenges, with both the technology and government regulations. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn't crazy. "I love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car," said Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google's self-driving project. "I hate the idea of my next-door neighbor having one." Kitty Hawk, the company backed by Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year. The company has attracted intense interest because of Page and its chief executive, Sebastian Thrun, an influential technologist and self-driving car pioneer who is the founding director of Google's X lab. In 2013, Zee Aero, a Kitty Hawk division, became the object of Silicon Valley rumors when reports of a small air taxilike vehicle first surfaced. Page declined a request for an interview but said in a statement: "We've all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I'm excited that one day very soon I'll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight." During his recent test flight, Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joysticklike controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake. The flight, just 15 feet above the water, circled over the lake about 20 or 30 yards from shore, and after about five minutes Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock. The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the startup, based in Mountain View, California, is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can now pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to "gain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer." It is an unusual offer, since the company has not yet set a price for the vehicle, and Thrun's and Page's involvement can be taken as evidence that the company is aiming far beyond hobbyists. Still, Kitty Hawk is clearly targeting a new kind of transportation - air flight that can be performed safely by most people and hopefully with government approval. "We have been in contact with the FAA, and we see the regulators as friends," Thrun said in an interview. He agreed that concerns about vehicles flying over our heads were legitimate. "I believe that all of us have to work together to understand how new technologies will shape the future of society, " he said. Two years ago, Thrun recruited two other pioneers, Robertson and Todd Reichert who were aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spinoff company that won a coveted prize for a human-powered helicopter and set the land speed record for a bicycle last year. They are flying under a special Federal Aviation Administration category for ultralight aircraft that does not require a pilot's license and is intended for recreational flying in uncongested areas. To add an extra margin of safety, the Kitty Hawk engineers are sticking to flying over open water. The company said the final commercial product will look different and be far quieter than the test model. "We hope that this is more of an exciting concept than what most people have had in their minds about flying cars," Robertson said. "This is not yet that product in terms of what we will say and what it can do, but I think it demonstrates a vision of the future." Kitty Hawk could face stiff competition, not just from about a half dozen startups, but from giant Airbus, based in Blagnac, France. The aerospace firm has announced two vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, concepts and is reported to be planning an initial test flight before the end of the year. At the Geneva International Motor Show last month, Airbus proposed an autonomous vehicle named Pop. Up that would operate on both the ground and in the air. And this year, the government of Dubai, in partnership with a Chinese firm, EHang, said it planned to begin operating an autonomous flying taxi by this July. Also, Uber is expected on Tuesday to detail its "vision for the future of Urban Air Mobility" at a conference in Dallas. There is no shortage of skeptics happy to point out the roadblocks for these vehicles. There is already significant resistance to the idea of unmanned drones flying over urban areas, and flying cars could face substantial opposition, even if they can be quieted to automotive noise levels. For these personal air vehicles to become a reality in the United States, the country would need a whole new air traffic control system. Two years ago, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began development of an air traffic control system meant for managing all sorts of flying vehicles, including drones. One NASA developer described it as an air traffic control system, "for a sky dark with drones." Researchers hope testing can begin by 2019. Batteries are also an issue. While electric propeller-driven motors seem promising, today's battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance, say a 30- or 50-mile commute. "How is this going to work? I don't want to be a Debbie Downer, but we can't even take our cellphones on airplanes today because of fears about battery fires," said Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University, who is researching personal air transport for NASA. And don't forget that flying cars will not be able to pull to the side of the road in an emergency, said John Leonard, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. "Silicon Valley is full of very smart people, but they don't always get the laws of physics," he said. "Gravity is a formidable adversary."

But the reality is a little less ESPN-ready. Tech companies generally identify their likely markets, make a product that will be different enough from competitors to offer a compelling reason to switch from A to B, and push for building business from there. The so-called "walled garden" approach -- and I apologize for putting two metaphors in the first paragraph, but there's no decent botanical metaphor for your usual "Google vs. Microsoft" set-up -- is simple but frustrating: You can only maximize your own personal computing tasks when every app is made by the same vendor, so all the apps work together like a happy family. The walled garden is beginning to crumble in spots. Nowhere is this more evident that with Microsoft's recent decision to offer several marquee Windows 10 Mail & Calendar features to Gmail users. The noteworthy part of the announcement is where Microsoft basically accepted that there are a lot of people who use Google's mail service, and they're not trying to get anyone to switch. They're just trying to get people to see how much nicer Microsoft's inbox AI is: Mail & Calendar apps have long supported connecting to and managing your Gmail account. But up until now, some capabilities were only available to those with an Outlook.com or Office 365 email address. With these updates, our latest features will be available for your Gmail account, including Focused Inbox and richer experiences for travel reservations and package deliveries. This is a genius move for a few reasons. Let's run through them. First, trying to get people to switch from one platform to another for any of their daily tools is a pain in the neck. (See also: trying to migrate from Evernote to OneNote.) By ignoring this goal completely and redefining the goal as "We know you have a years-long habit of using Gmail. We just want you to be able to use it better," Microsoft is not asking anyone to do any tedious migration.  Second, positioning this as "Hey, we think you'll like our features, so use them on whatever" is a great way to promote the competence and utility of one vendor's tools (Microsoft's) over another's (Google's). Third, getting users outside the Outlook bucket to use the Focused Inbox tool, the travel tool, and the package-tracking tool gives Microsoft a broader set of data with which to work as it continues to refine its machine learning and target a shifting customer class.  Last -- but certainly not least -- Microsoft's efforts to integrate its tools into other companies' products is a great way to train users to expect this from all their vendors. We're already mostly there in the consumer-class space: People expect to be able to export a Google sheet as an Excel spreadsheet, to use Outlook on their iOs device, to save a web page from Chrome into OneNote or Evernote, to have their Google Calendar reminders pop up on their OS X desktop. It's been a tougher slog in an enterprise environment. There are good reasons for why workplaces might take a mono-platform approach: It's cheaper in some cases, it's easier to say "no" to a lot of technology and "yes" to only a handful of things, it's less work for people whose jobs including provisioning and supporting technology. But it's impossible to overstate how much the overall computing environment has changed in the past decade. People are habituated to permeable computing, i.e. the idea that their tasks -- be it social media posts, spreadsheet analysis, e-commerce purchasing, email management -- are the primary thing, and the hardware and software used to do it entirely secondary. Permeable computing has seeped into every sphere where "computing" was traditionally overseen and administrated by a small group making tech decisions for everyone. Consequently, people's expectations for how they'll use their technology to get things done are shifting what technology ends up in the workplace and at home. Apple may have kickstarted this shift with its smartphone, and Google may have capitalized earlier on decoupling apps from operating systems and making the browser the "operating system" for the apps that once lived on hard drives. But Microsoft is the company that has taken these realities and begun running with them. However ... what Microsoft did right in rolling out this product is a different point from whether they rolled out a good implementation that works for users. There are some early reports that this implementation is not as painless as Microsoft's blog post would have you believe.  And no matter how dramatically the tech landscape shifts, there is one truth that echoes across the years: It doesn't matter if Microsoft has a good idea at the right time. It matters if they can turn that good idea into a usable product that people don't want to live without. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Now the Xiaomi-backed Yi is expanding into the world of VR and 360-degree video with two new cameras being announced at the NAB conference in Las Vegas. One is for professionals — it’s called the Yi Halo, and it was made in partnership with Google. The other is a consumer spherical camera called the Yi 360 VR. The Yi Halo is a $17,999 17-camera monster capable of shooting stereoscopic video in 8K resolution at 30 frames per second, or 5.8K at 60 frames per second. It was built to work with Jump, which is a high-end VR creation platform that Google launched in 2015. The core idea of Jump is to encourage VR filmmaking by removing some of the biggest barriers. Google provides general blueprints for the ringed camera rig as well as server space for stitching all the high-resolution imagery together, and then gets to kick back while hardware companies and filmmakers create content to fill its budding Daydream VR platform. Google offers the plans and the tools in hopes that companies will create content for its VR platform Yi is just the second company to build a rig for the platform — GoPro released the 16-camera Odyssey last year. (IMAX is also working on a Jump-compatible camera setup, and Facebook has its own $25,000 and up solution in the Surround 360 rig.) The company is using modified versions of its 4K action camera to make up the Halo. And while it tops out at the same 8K resolution as the GoPro Odyssey, the ability to shoot 5.8K at 60 frames per second is unique.  The Yi Halo also has one more camera than the Odyssey, which is placed on top of the rig in order to better capture 360-degree footage directly above the viewer’s head when observed through a VR headset. It also has a smartphone app, a touchscreen control panel, and there are levels on the rig structure so filmmakers can line up the horizon. Yi has a knack for these small, but meaningful, advantages over what GoPro offers. For instance, Yi was the first to make an action camera that shoots 4K footage at 60 frames per second, something professional GoPro users have clamored for since the Hero 4 cameras were released. Yi has a knack for small details, but the overall user experience is often hit or miss The $399 Yi 360 VR is another example of this overarching strategy. It can capture 360-degree video at 30 frames per second in 5.7K resolution, slightly edging out the 5.2K resolution of Fusion, the spherical camera GoPro announced last week. (That’s also higher resolution than other leading consumer 360-degree cameras like the Nikon KeyMission 360 or the Samsung Gear 360.)  But while GoPro was thin on details for the Fusion, Yi showed up at NAB ready with specs for its announcement. The Yi 360 VR uses a pair of overlapping 220-degree lenses, two 12-megapixel Sony IMX377 sensors, and an Ambarella processing chip to stitch the footage together in-camera. It can also live stream 2.5K footage at 30 frames per second over Wi-Fi. Users should expect about an hour of battery life. Yi is a fly that GoPro can’t swat Yi might be a fly that GoPro can’t swat, but the Chinese company’s weakness so far has been everything beyond specs. Its action cameras aren’t as user-friendly, even if they’re typically cheaper. And, in the case of Yi’s first attempt at a mirrorless camera, they can sometimes be so frustrating that they don’t seem worth the savings. The Yi 360 VR will be available in limited release in June, so we’ll have to wait until at least then to find out of the trend continues. Both cameras, meanwhile, will come to the US before making it to Yi’s home base of China. Yi CEO Sean Da tells The Verge that, while he expects Chinese VR viewership to boom in the coming years, this is because the majority of “high performance, high quality video creators are still US or European creators.” To that end, the Yi Halo will be available starting today as part of a limited access program called Jump Start. The company will take applications from filmmakers to receive access to a Jump camera rig and unlimited use of the Google’s Jump Assembler cloud service. Google plans to give out 100 of the Yi Halo cameras to help boost VR filmmaking, and the application process will be open until May 22nd.

Most Popular GIF YouTube Kitty Hawk By Avery Thompson Apr 24, 2017 It's a good year for flying cars. Uber is revealing its concept for a flying car this week, and German company Lilium just revealed its own prototype. Aeromobil is committing to a production run of flying cars by 2020, and now startup Kitty Hawk, funded by Google's Larry Page, has revealed its own unique design. Unlike the rest of these flying car startups, Kitty Hawk appears to be heading in a different direction, cornering the flying Jet Ski market. Take a look: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular Kitty Hawk is a secretive startup founded and financed by Alphabet CEO Larry Page and run by Google X founder Sebastian Thrun. Back in June there were rumors that Kitty Hawk was working on a quadcopter-based design, and it appears that those rumors were mostly correct. The Kitty Hawk Flyer features 8 blades and a metal mesh frame, along with pontoons for water landings. Related Story GIF This Copter Sure Doesn't Look Like a Deathtrap This shows Kitty Hawk is moving in a completely different direction from other electric car companies. Instead of focusing on transportation, the Flyer is designed for recreation, building something simpler and probably cheaper than their competition. Building a light recreational vehicle instead of a complex flying car means Kitty Hawk can avoid the tangle of regulations surrounding both aircraft and cars. Instead, the Flyer falls into an FAA category that doesn't even require a pilot's licence to operate. It won't be making your commute any faster, but it might make that lakeside vacation more fun. Kitty Hawk says their Flyer will be available for purchase sometime later this year, and you can pay $100 now to become a "Flyer Discovery Member" which gives you first pick when the Flyer is sold and a $2000 discount on the purchase price.

Photo: Kitty Hawk via The New York Times mail print View all comments Tweet By John Markoff - - Published: 10:55 AM, April 25, 2017 Updated: 1:21 PM, April 25, 2017 CLEARLAKE (California) — On a recent afternoon, an aerospace engineer working for a small Silicon Valley company called Kitty Hawk piloted a flying car above a scenic lake about 100 miles (160km) north of San Francisco. Kitty Hawk’s flying car, if you insisted on calling it a “car,” looked like something Luke Skywalker would have built out of spare parts. It was an open-seated, 220-pound (100kg) contraption with room for one person, powered by eight battery-powered propellers that howled as loudly as a speedboat. The tech industry is fond of disrupting things, and lately the automakers have been a big target. Cars that use artificial intelligence to drive themselves, for example, have been in development for a few years and can be spotted on roads in a number of cities. And now, coming onto the radar screen, are flying machines that do not exactly look like your father’s Buick with wings. More than a dozen startups backed by deep-pocketed industry figures like Mr Larry Page, a Google founder — along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, the ride-hailing company Uber and even the government of Dubai — are taking on the dream of the flying car. The approaches by the companies vary and the realization of their competing visions seems far in the future, but they have one thing in common: a belief that one day regular people should be able to fly their own vehicles around town. There are challenges, with both the technology and government regulations. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn’t crazy. “I love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car,” said Mr Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google’s self-driving project. “I hate the idea of my next-door neighbour having one.” Kitty Hawk, the company backed by Mr Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year. The company has attracted intense interest because of Mr Page and its chief executive, Mr Sebastian Thrun, an influential technologist and self-driving car pioneer who is the founding director of Google’s X lab. In 2013, Zee Aero, a Kitty Hawk division, became the object of Silicon Valley rumours when reports of a small air taxilike vehicle first surfaced. Mr Page declined a request for an interview but said in a statement: “We’ve all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I’m excited that one day very soon I’ll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight.” During his recent test flight, Mr Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joysticklike controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake. The flight, just 15 feet (4.6m) above the water, circled over the lake about 20 or 30 yards (18 or 27m) from shore, and after about five minutes Mr Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock. The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the startup, based in Mountain View, California, is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can now pay US$100 (S$139) to sign up for a US$2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to “gain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer”. It is an unusual offer, since the company has not yet set a price for the vehicle, and Mr Thrun’s and Mr Page’s involvement can be taken as evidence that the company is aiming far beyond hobbyists. Still, Kitty Hawk is clearly targeting a new kind of transportation — air flight that can be performed safely by most people and hopefully with government approval. “We have been in contact with the FAA, and we see the regulators as friends,” Mr Thrun said in an interview. He agreed that concerns about vehicles flying over our heads were legitimate. “I believe that all of us have to work together to understand how new technologies will shape the future of society, “ he said. Two years ago, Mr Thrun recruited two other pioneers, Mr Robertson and Mr Todd Reichert who were aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spinoff company that won a coveted prize for a human-powered helicopter and set the land speed record for a bicycle last year. They are flying under a special Federal Aviation Administration category for ultralight aircraft that does not require a pilot’s license and is intended for recreational flying in uncongested areas. To add an extra margin of safety, the Kitty Hawk engineers are sticking to flying over open water. The company said the final commercial product will look different and be far quieter than the test model. “We hope that this is more of an exciting concept than what most people have had in their minds about flying cars,” Mr Robertson said. “This is not yet that product in terms of what we will say and what it can do, but I think it demonstrates a vision of the future.” Kitty Hawk could face stiff competition, not just from about a half dozen startups, but from giant Airbus, based in Blagnac, France. The aerospace firm has announced two vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, concepts and is reported to be planning an initial test flight before the end of the year. At the Geneva International Motor Show last month, Airbus proposed an autonomous vehicle named Pop Up that would operate on both the ground and in the air. And this year, the government of Dubai, in partnership with a Chinese firm, EHang, said it planned to begin operating an autonomous flying taxi by this July. Also, Uber is expected on Tuesday to detail its “vision for the future of Urban Air Mobility” at a conference in Dallas. There is no shortage of skeptics happy to point out the roadblocks for these vehicles. There is already significant resistance to the idea of unmanned drones flying over urban areas, and flying cars could face substantial opposition, even if they can be quieted to automotive noise levels. For these personal air vehicles to become a reality in the United States, the country would need a whole new air traffic control system. Two years ago, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began development of an air traffic control system meant for managing all sorts of flying vehicles, including drones. One NASA developer described it as an air traffic control system, “for a sky dark with drones.” Researchers hope testing can begin by 2019. Batteries are also an issue. While electric propeller-driven motors seem promising, today’s battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance, say a 30- or 50-mile commute. “How is this going to work? I don’t want to be a Debbie Downer, but we can’t even take our cellphones on airplanes today because of fears about battery fires,” said Prof Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University, who is researching personal air transport for NASA. And don’t forget that flying cars will not be able to pull to the side of the road in an emergency, said Mr John Leonard, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “Silicon Valley is full of very smart people, but they don’t always get the laws of physics,” he said. “Gravity is a formidable adversary.” THE NEW YORK TIMES mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Daily Focus READ COMMENTED “Star-gazing” shrimp discovered in South Africa ‘You can change your life’, says former kampung boy who's an ex-VP of SGX ‘Thank the aliens’: Thousands displaced for China’s huge telescope ‘Sleeping giant’ glacier may lift sea levels by two metres: Study ‘Reverse microwave’ that can chill drinks in 45 seconds developed When to tell daughters about a genetic breast cancer risk Sulphur-powered giant shipworm unearthed in Philippines Prince William speaks with Lady Gaga on mental health No longer a dream: Silicon Valley takes on the flying car Most teens ‘relatively’ happy, OECD finds 500kg Egyptian sheds half her weight after India surgery Inside Today World Hungarian ruling party lawmaker charged with graft: prosecutors Roadside bomb kills at least 10 people in minibus, Pakistan official says North Korea marks military anniversary with firing drill Reports of North Korea artillery drill as U.S. submarine docks in South Kenya bus, tanker crash kills 24: police Business Mitsubishi and Nissan full merger is not an option: chairman Credit Suisse investors prepare to grill chairman Rohner over pay LVMH, Arnault to simplify Christian Dior business structure Asia stocks near two-year high, euro steady as French vote lifts mood Toshiba to start taking bids in June for its Swiss unit Landis+Gyr: Kyodo Sports Roberta Vinci disagrees with Maria Sharapova’s wildcard return to tennis FAS has no control over how NFL clubs run jackpot operations FAS’ financial practices ‘are sound, but donation policy needed’ Pacquaio: title fight against Jeff Horn will show I’m still a global force Sharapova’s ready for hostile reception when she returns from ban this week Entertainment OneRepublic and Duran Duran among headliners to perform at 2017 Singapore Grand Prix Weird clouds may have inspired The Scream, say scientists Rui En explains herself to elderly couple Pop singers, award-winning filmmakers contribute to opening of the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre Musicians in aquariums make sounds in a silent world About TODAY Apps RSS Sitemap Syndication Contact Us Advertise with Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy About MediaCorp Copyright 2017 © Mediacorp Press Ltd.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Your Mercedes now takes commands from Google Home, Alexa By John Hoff - April 24, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Just to be clear, we’re not yet at that point where we can go “Alexa, have my car ready at the front door in 5 minutes.” But with the integration of Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa into Mercedes-Benz, there are some neat new tricks that you can do from the comfort of your office or living room for your German-made luxury car. Google Home and Alexa are now supported by the “Mercedes me” car system. So without opening up the Mercedes me app, you can now go “Ok Google, tell Mercedes me to start my car.” You can do this from Alexa as well. You can also ask “Alexa, tell Mercedes me to lock the car” so you can stop being paranoid if you forgot to lock your car or not. You can also program your trips from your living room. “Alexa, ask Mercedes me to send an address to the car” will program the car’s navigation by voice. You can also ask for points-of-interest to be set as destinations. Pretty cool, huh? The compatibility starts today, with both the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The requirement, for now, is a 2016 or 2017 model Mercedes vehicle. You also need an active Mercedes me account and an active mbrace subscription. These features are currently usable only in the US, but Mercedes says that it will roll out the feature later this year in Europe.

This is also why it probably wouldn’t be a surprise if Google were to do the same with their 2017 Pixels. Of course whether or not that will happen remains to be seen, but a report from Winfuture.de (via PhoneArena) points towards the Android Open Source Project in which it was revealed that Google will be using the Snapdragon 835 for this year’s Pixels. Not only that, but it also appears that Google could have not just one, not two, but three devices in the works. Earlier this year we reported on the codenames for this year’s Pixels which is muskie and walleye, then last month we heard that there was one more device in the works codenamed taimen. Note that all of these are named after types of fishes which is in line with last year’s Pixel codenames. We’re not sure what taimen is supposed to represent since muskie and walleye are meant to represent the Pixel and Pixel XL, but either way based in the information, all three handsets appear to be powered by a Snapdragon 835. Take it with a grain of salt since this is kind of early information, but hopefully we’ll have more details to share soon. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about Google and Pixel.

Dubbed “Yi Halo”, the virtual reality (VR) camera — which comprises 17 different Yi 4K cams — was unveiled at NAB in Las Vegas yesterday, and is set to go on sale for approximately US$17,000 (RM74,664) this summer, with some units already available to select creators. While the camera itself is built by Yi — combining 16 spherically aligned 4K action cameras with an extra camera facing upwards — it incorporates the Jump cloud stitching infrastructure, which uses cloud-based software and smart stitching algorithms to produce stereoscopic 360-degree videos. While Google originally launched Jump in 2015 to simplify VR video production, the “Yi Halo” only marks Google’s second Jump tie-up with a camera maker, following an initial collaboration with GoPro to launch the “GoPro Odyssey” (via Variety). — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Personal flying machine’ maker plans deliveries this year (VIDEO) Google debuts next-gen Jump VR camera (VIDEO) LinkedIn membership reaches half a billion Watch the US$3m 'Dota 2' Kiev Major live from today Samsung to update software over ‘red screen’ smartphone Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone’s 10th anniversary Samsung users see red over ‘tinted’ Galaxy S8 screen Watch the US$3m 'Dota 2' Kiev Major live from today Facebook's strategy for augmented reality starts with phones Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Serena Williams calls Nastase’s comments racist Reuters Video: Obama back in the spotlight, vows to help future leaders Reuters Video: Venezuela’s death toll rises as unrest enters fourth week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them,” said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google’s home town of Mountain View, California. “Today we’re announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017.” The video showed the aircraft — with two pontoons and a spider web-like platform — taking off from a lake at an undisclosed location and hovering above the water, where it is meant to be used. The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 100 kilogrammes and fly at speeds up to 40km/hour. The company describes the Flyer as “a new, all-electric aircraft,” which is “safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas” under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot’s license is required, and two hours’ training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google’s self-driving car, tweeted: “Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype.” The company announced it was offering three-year “memberships” for US$100 (RM440) to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Personal flying machine’ maker plans deliveries this year (VIDEO) Google debuts next-gen Jump VR camera (VIDEO) LinkedIn membership reaches half a billion Watch the US$3m 'Dota 2' Kiev Major live from today Samsung to update software over ‘red screen’ smartphone Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone’s 10th anniversary Samsung users see red over ‘tinted’ Galaxy S8 screen Watch the US$3m 'Dota 2' Kiev Major live from today Facebook's strategy for augmented reality starts with phones Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Serena Williams calls Nastase’s comments racist Reuters Video: Obama back in the spotlight, vows to help future leaders Reuters Video: Venezuela’s death toll rises as unrest enters fourth week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines Related Articles Alphabet said to bring in veteran fixer to rework Google fiber division SkyRunner David beats Google Goliath Page to all-terrain vehicle (VIDEO) Google co-founder funding flying car projects, says report (VIDEO) Nest co-founder Fadell flies the coop Who are Silicon Valley’s most generous donors?

By John Markoff New York Times  April 25, 2017 CLEARLAKE, Calif. — On a recent afternoon, an aerospace engineer working for a small Silicon Valley company called Kitty Hawk piloted a flying car above a scenic lake about 100 miles north of San Francisco. Kitty Hawk’s flying car, if you insisted on calling it a “car,” looked like something Luke Skywalker would have built out of spare parts. It was an open-seated, 220-pound contraption with room for one person, powered by eight battery-powered propellers that howled as loudly as a speedboat. Advertisement The tech industry is fond of disrupting things, and lately the automakers have been a big target. Cars that use artificial intelligence to drive themselves, for example, have been in development for a few years and can be spotted on roads in a number of cities. And now, coming onto the radar screen, are flying machines that do not exactly look like your father’s Buick with wings. More than a dozen startups backed by deep-pocketed industry figures like Larry Page, a Google founder — along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, the ride-hailing company Uber and even the government of Dubai — are taking on the dream of the flying car. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The approaches by the companies vary and the realization of their competing visions seems far in the future, but they have one thing in common: a belief that one day regular people should be able to fly their vehicles around town. There are challenges, with both the technology and government regulations. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn’t crazy. “I love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car,” said Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google’s self-driving project. “I hate the idea of my next-door neighbor having one.” Advertisement Kitty Hawk, the company backed by Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year. The company has attracted intense interest because of Page and its chief executive, Sebastian Thrun, an influential technologist and self-driving car pioneer who is the founding director of Google’s X lab. During his recent test flight, Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joysticklike controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake. The flight, just 15 feet above the water, circled over the lake about 20 or 30 yards from shore, and after about five minutes Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock. The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the startup, based in Mountain View, Calif., is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can now pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to “gain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer.” Batteries are an issue. While electric propeller-driven motors seem promising, today’s battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance. “How is this going to work? I don’t want to be a Debbie Downer, but we can’t even take our cellphones on airplanes today because of fears about battery fires,” said Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University. And don’t forget that flying cars will not be able to pull to the side of the road in an emergency, said John Leonard, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “Silicon Valley is full of very smart people, but they don’t always get the laws of physics,” he said. “Gravity is a formidable adversary.” Loading comments...

Google unveils new YI HALO VR camera for their Jump platform Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/24 11:16am PDTApr 24, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares104 Cardboard Google News VR Back in 2015 at I/O, and just after announcing Cardboard, Google rolled out Jump. At the time the hardware that accompanied it was the GoPro Odyssey, a big circular contraption containing 16 GoPro cameras. It was meant to make recording in 360 degrees for VR purposes a bit easier, both logistically and in terms of the tools and software needed. Don't be too surprised if that flew under your radar at the time; there hasn't been much in the way of news from Google about Jump since then (though there was a cool WebVR film announced a few days ago that used it). It seems that the platform has come due for a hardware upgrade, though, as today Google has announced the YI HALO as well as a new Jump Start program for free access to the cameras and software. The original GoPro Odyssey took more than a year to arrive after being announced at I/O. Even then it never went up for general sale, requiring registration and approval for "select industry professionals" before you could plop down the $15K for it. It remains to be seen if the YI HALO will suffer the same exclusivity concerns, but with more than one option available to use Google's Jump Assembler tech at least there's some choice. It also looks like the YI HALO will be a whole lot more advanced than its GoPro forebear. It features a 100 minute battery, additional resolution options (8K @ 30FPS, or 5.7K @ 60FPS), a lighter and more ruggedized design, a built-in control interface, and Wi-Fi based control and preview via an app as well as a separate Bluetooth remote. The tech behind how Jump stitches the images together is pretty cool, but it's even cooler seeing it in action. With the new Jump Start program aspiring directors and filmmakers will have easier and cheaper access to the tech as well, so we might see more high-quality media made using the format in the future. Those who are interested can sign up now for more info. According to the manufacturer it should be available sometime late this summer .

You start off doing one harmless Google search of someone (you know, just to make sure they're not a serial killer or something) and then suddenly you've blacked out and woken up in the matrix, surrounded by his social security number, blood type, mother's maiden name, and other info you can never unsee! Here, a non-exhaustive list of things every girl has done — so you can feel better about yourself the next time you wake up drowning in a Google-stalk. 1. Looking him up so much on Instagram that his ex-girlfriend's handle auto populates in the search bar. "Um, no, I also know Caitlin ... She was my roommate's friend's coworker who studied abroad together." —a paper thin excuse you hope you never have to trot out. 2. Deleting your search history before you hang out because you just can't risk it. Then you have to search a bunch of random dog accounts and memes to look up so it doesn't look suspiciously empty. 3. Opening up a private browsing window just to stalk his LinkedIn. The time you save figuring out his major and honors activities on your own time is time you could spend asking the important questions later on, like: What is the ideal ratio of sons to daughters you would like to have? Where will you be spending the holidays? Classic colonial or midcentury modern for your starter home? 4. Going so far back in Google results that you find his high school sports rankings. Oooh, varsity track. Nice. Bonus points if you then look up his high school's Wikipedia page to find out just how competitive that track program was. 5. Trying to view his profile from your friends' accounts so it's "not weird." "I know you're on the phone with your mom, but lemme just check out his Instagram story real quick! No, I can't use my own phone. Because it looks desperate that's why." 6. Accidentally memorising his Grandpa's obituary and thus his entire family tree. Whoa, how'd you end up on his maternal grandmother's cousin's sister's uncle's Ancestry.com page? Haha, weird. 7. Curating your conversation around things you noticed he likes. Extra points if you then try to downplay said new info to make it look ... casual. "Oh you're into The Cure? Crazy how *looks at hand* 'that is a band,' huh?" 8. Stalking his Facebook with the precision of a surgeon. As in, elbows locked at your sides, sitting upright, avoiding the trackpad like the plague (just in case you slip and 24 mouse clicks later, accidentally like profile picture no. 78 out of 140.) 9. Viewing his Instagram on private browsing so you won't accidentally like anything. It's too easy! Also videos: You obv wanna see them, but the risk of accidentally liking while trying to play or adding too many new loops would totally out you. 10. Looking at his Venmo. So precious how he and his roommate Jake split utilities on there! LOL. "What do you think this means?" you ask all your friends about what is clearly a straightforward food bill being split. You aren't too sure though — guys can be so mysterious. 11. Looking up his parent's mortgage on Zillow. 12. If you met on a dating app, looking them up after your initial matching to see if they've updated their profile since meeting you. Aka are they over you aka do they hate you now? 13. Creating a whole narrative of his past relationships based on two photos of him tagged with a girl, declaring her the enemy, etc. You know, reasonable conclusions. 14. Physically holding your phone up closer to your face to see as much of their Snapchat story from the tiny little preview icon without watching. You can only watch so much of someone's story without sending a message, so you don't want to waste one of your precious views on dumpster content. 15. Going through their likes tab on Twitter or monitoring your following feed on Instagram just to see what they're up to. Cool how you also now follow this niche meme account now too, hahaha, damn, weird. 16. Saying their last name as yours in your head. Carina Gyllenha— whoops! If you've done this even once it counts!!! Sorry, I don't make the rules.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile How to Download Locations on Google Maps for Offline Usage By Zara Ali 10 hours ago 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Maps is nothing less than a blessing. The service comes to your rescue everywhere and ensures that you reach your destination in time. The service is deemed to work best on good internet connection, but what about the days when you are away from the internet and looking for directions? Or when you are on a road trip with your friends and find yourself in a low connectivity region? Before you exclaim, we know that you know about the offline version of Google Maps. But, do you know that it needs to be tweaked before starting to count on it. With the steps mentioned below, we will help you in setting up your Google Maps for offline use. Simply follow these instructions, and you will never find yourself struggling with internet woes on your trips. Related Google Play Awards 2017 Nominees Announced, Check out the Best of Play Store Plan your routes and download them in advance The first thing to do when downloading Google Maps offline is to identify your area. You need to plan in advance about the region you want offline maps access for. Before starting a trip, make sure you have downloaded the map area that covers the entire region. Google Maps offline offer wide area selection; it means that you can download the map area for two major cities like LA and California. You must be also ready to sacrifice some storage space on your device as the downloaded data is anything but small. You can also download it on your device’s external storage like microSD or SD card. Advertisement To Download Google Maps offline on SD card, follow these steps. Open Menu in Google Maps app on your device Tap on “Offline Areas.” Select “Settings” in the top right corner and then tap on “Storage Preferences.” Switch the storage preference from “Device” to “SD card.” (this option will only show up when you have SD card inserted into your device). You also need to know that offline maps expire after 30 days, so make sure that you check it before starting a trip. This happens because Google likes keeping you updated about what’s new around you or what has changed around you. Even for the offline Maps, it wants you to have an updated version. Also, even though Google Maps offline offers pretty much all the essential services, but you can’t expect the same experience as the online version. You can search for addresses, find business in your downloaded area and navigate to the site. However, you won’t get features like walking directions, transit details, and more stuff. How to download Google Maps offline like a pro Launch Google Maps app on your device Type the area you want to download and then tap on its name at the bottom Now, tap on “Download” option It will now show you a box, which can be zoomed in and out to select more or less area Select the area size as per your requirement and then tap on “Download” option given at the bottom Once your download finishes, you can use it for 30 days without any block. Just remember, that this is not as intuitive as the online version but it will surely guide you correctly to the destination. Related Bid Goodbye to Parking Woes with This Nifty New Feature Coming to Google Maps Check for your saved offline area on Google Maps Open Google Maps app on your device Select Menu and then tap on “Offline Areas.” You will now see areas marked as “Home”, “Work” or “Area 1/Area2.” To update or delete saved destinations, just tap on the area you want to remove/update and then select either of the “Delete/Update” options Prepared to go on a road trip? We hope these tools help you in setting up Google Maps for offline usage.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 25 April 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Mechanical and digital watchmakers struggle for control of wrists Smartwatches were billed as the next big thing in electronics following the success of the smartphone, but that hope quickly turned to disappointment when big sales failed to materialise. — dpa Smartwatches were billed as the next big thing in electronics following the success of the smartphone. But that hope quickly turned to disappointment when big sales failed to materialise.  Mechanical watches have remained stubbornly popular. But it's still too early to ring the death knell of the smartwatch.  The two biggest tech players in smartwatches, Apple and Google, have kept these products alive by integrating their digital assistants into them. Apple's Siri first became available on the Apple Watch in early 2015 while Google installed its Assistant only lately into its Android Wear 2.0.  "We see huge potential in how useful Assistant will be. You can simply tap the smartphone on your wrist and receive the information you need," says Android Wear product manager David Singleton.  The Apple Watch has been the undisputed leader since its launch. But Google is determined that its Android Wear will become the preferred operating system for most smartphone makers.  Even mechanical watchmakers like TAG Heuer, Montblanc and Movado have dipped their toes into the smartwatch market and launched products powered by Android Wear.  But it's the fashion watchmakers who have really embraced smartwatches. Every man's watch produced by the label Michael Kors will have a microchip and touchscreen.  But hybrid watches – a combination of classical mechanical watch face and digital technology such as a camera – are on their way. "In one year Michael Kors will be the second-largest smartwatch maker in the world," the label's chief executive John Idol said at the recent Baselworld watch fair.  Smartwatches were relatively rare at the trade fair. TAG Heuer, however, did present the second generation of its Connected smart watch.  Company boss Jean-Claude Biver is pursuing a strategy of selling both smartwatches and mechanical watches to his customers. A Connected watch costs about US$1,600 (RM7,036) to buy. For an additional US$1,600 (RM7,036) the watch owner can upgrade to a mechanical TAG Heuer.  Biver is a living legend in the world of watch making. "The smartwatch could be dangerous for the Swiss watch industry but not for the art of watchmaking," he says. "Art is eternal and eternity cannot combine with anything that will become obsolete."  But Google manager Singleton is optimistic that smartwatches have a future. "Very few luxury watches are sold in comparison to cheap models. We're going to see big price differentials in smartwatches. Anything you wear on your body will always have a function as an expression of personality and style."  But what if technology one day changes human's habits so much that they no longer value the art of the watchmaker?

We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them,” said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google’s home town of Mountain View, California. “Today we’re announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017.” The video showed the single-seat aircraft -- with two pontoons and a spider web-like platform -- taking off from a lake at an undisclosed location and hovering above the water, where it is meant to be used. The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 100kg and fly at speeds up to 40km/h; users are supposed to hover at low levels, only 4.5 metres high. The company describes the Flyer as “a new, all-electric aircraft,” which is “safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas” under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot’s license is required, and two hours’ training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google’s self-driving car, tweeted: “Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype.” The company announced it was offering three-year “memberships” for US$100 to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. The startup offered only limited details about the company. An email response to queries said the lead engineers were Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, who created a startup called Aerovelo which aims to produce the fastest human-powered vehicle. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. A blog post by writer Cimeron Morrissey, who took the flyer for a test run, offered some clues on how it feels. “The prototype looks and feels a lot like a flying motorcycle. You mount the seat and lean forward, just like you would on a bike,” she wrote. “I feel light and ecstatic and utterly free. This is just like my flying dreams!” Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines.   Most Popular Viewed 1 How China’s aircraft carriers stack up against other nations 2 Donald Tsang speaks of ‘heartaches’ after being released on bail 3 China’s ‘robot goddess’ Jiajia flubs live interview in English 4 Chinese media pull reports on big-spending HNA Group 5 Puffing across the ‘One Belt, One Road’ rail route to nowhere Shared 1 Puffing across the ‘One Belt, One Road’ rail route to nowhere 2 Trump to call Xi and Abe today as North Korea tensions mount 3 China’s ‘robot goddess’ Jiajia flubs live interview in English 4 Chinese media pull reports on big-spending HNA Group 5 Hong Kong knee surgeon will try to save Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s career Commented 1 With or without Trump, China’s export machine is remaking itself 2 Why is Tianzhou 1 so important in China’s ambitious space mission? 3 China’s ‘robot goddess’ Jiajia flubs live interview in English 4 A plea for rules, even if Hong Kong loses to Singapore in fintech 5 i-Cable down 21 pc despite white knights ride to rescue Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2017 SCMP Invites you to Le French May “Paris Ballet Legend - A Night With The Stars”       You may also like Politics After fall of Jakarta’s ethnic Chinese leader, is Widodo next? 23 Apr 2017 - 11:18am 7 Zero Carbon Building reveals Hong Kong's eco-home potential In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Hong Kong Now not the time for Hong Kong electoral reform, says Beijing 23 Apr 2017 - 8:58am 198 HKIS Students Go Under Razor for Kids’ Cancer Research Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Hong Kong ‘Aviation competition won’t stop travellers coming to Hong Kong’ 23 Apr 2017 - 9:04am 2 Insight & Opinion Smearing Singapore: why can’t Hollywood ever get Asia right? 20 Apr 2017 - 6:46pm 72 China Plug pulled on US interview with wanted Chinese tycoon 20 Apr 2017 - 10:48pm 20 World 45 years of grappling with Vancouver unaffordability 21 Apr 2017 - 1:11am 12 Asia Trump: ‘Korea used to be part of China’.

Some of those companies have vanished into thin air, while the others are finding themselves quite lost as more and more people get connected to the internet. By: Nandagopal Rajan | Published: April 25, 2017 6:37 AM The Indian manufacturer is clearly playing to its strengths, pushing the phone primarily on offline channels and tapping in on the opportunity arising from the craze for Reliance Jio’s 4G services. (Reuters) Over the past few years, there has been too much chatter about connecting the next billion. Some of those companies have vanished into thin air, while the others are finding themselves quite lost as more and more people get connected to the internet. Anyway, a lot of people across the world have tried to figure out the best way to connect those who aren’t online already. The hurdles were mainly to do with the cost of the device, the cost of connectivity and also the language barrier—with the internet being predominantly English. Over the past year or so, India has progressed significantly on all three counts. In fact, when it comes to bringing down the cost of connectivity, we seem to be way ahead of every other country, with price wars making customers the king in every sense. And thanks to Google, as well as the efforts of companies like Indus OS and Reverie, there have been significant inroads into regional language technologies. However, the cost of owning a device that will let a user get the best of the cheap and fast indigenous internet still seems a bit far away. You May Also Want To Watch: The first efforts towards this goal came when Google launched Android One a couple of years ago. Despite best intentions, the $100 phone was anything but a success. The threshold was still too high. Over the next few months, it became clear that this mark was the entry point for the smartphone segment in India, but primarily for those who already owned a phone and could afford a new one. A price point of around Rs 6,000 was just not good enough to get new people on board. Micromax, which was one of Google’s partners for Android One, seems to have come out of the experiment with some solid learnings. A few weeks ago, the company launched its version of an affordable smartphone for the masses, the Bharat 2. This Rs 3,990 smartphone has a four-inch screen, 4G connectivity, a relatively pure Android 6.0 Marshmallow, day-long battery life, and is powered by Spreadtrum’s SC9832 processor. The phone, though launched without much fanfare, has been a kind of runaway success. The Indian manufacturer is clearly playing to its strengths, pushing the phone primarily on offline channels and tapping in on the opportunity arising from the craze for Reliance Jio’s 4G services. If this phone becomes a big success, this could be the way for Indian manufacturers to claw back into the market after having been beaten down by heavy-spending Chinese competition over the past few quarters. In addition, if anyone is able to hit the sweet spot when it comes to the perfect price and specifications combination in the sub-$50 price band, then the kind of volumes they can rake up will be humongous. For some of the Indian players who have been shifting focus back to feature phones because they are not able to do much in the smartphone space in the present scenario, this might be the way to future success. Meanwhile, there has been some buzz around a 4G feature phone in recent times. The concept itself does not make much sense to me. If all you need is a feature phone, then why do you need it in 4G? Well, the reason some are talking about such a device is not the need to get more people to start using 4G services, but the fact that Reliance Jio is a 4G-only service and even a feature phone will need to be 4G-enabled to be able to run on their network. This seems to be creating a new use case, and it won’t be long before the ecosystem in China churns out more feature phones that can run on 4G VoLTE (Voice over Long-Term Evolution) networks and bring down the barrier for entry into the Jio network. But if such a phone is going to be priced in the region of Rs 2,000, then we have more the reason to get a good affordable smartphone in the market as soon as possible. Yes, it is time someone made a really good smartphone that everyone can afford. [email protected] No Comments.

The UK's science academy has spent a year and a half working on the report, entitled "Machine Learning: the power and promise of computers that learn by example", in order to find out how the UK general public views machine learning. Trending: Google Home review: Can Google's smart speaker topple Amazon Echo and Alexa? The report also outlines suggestions for how government regulation and education can be best put in place to accelerate growth of this industry in the UK to ensure that humans stay in control of machines. To write their report, the Royal Society interviewed 200 experts from across a wide range of fields to find out whether machine learning is already being used in different industries, as well as interviewing people to find out what they think about its effects. Don't miss: Steve Wozniak: Apple, Google and Facebook will still be around and 'bigger' in 2075 What is machine learning? Machine learning is a type of computer science that governs how machines are able to process data and gain insights from it that might be useful to humans. This is a type of artificial intelligence, and it is used by everyone from Google and Facebook to even your supermarket to look at what you buy and how frequently. Due to the huge amount of data involved, there are concerns about how the data will be used and stored in order to ensure our privacy. Most popular: Unmanned Chinese cargo ship Tianzhou-1 docks with Tiangong-2 space lab One example is the controversy over Google DeepMind's partnership with the NHS. The NHS gave DeepMind access to 1.6m patients' records from three London hospitals so that the computers could understand how to improve healthcare practices. Since the data contains sensitive information, such as the identities of patients who are HIV-positive, critics have asked why Google needs all this data and whether it will really be kept secure. There has also been an increase in scare mongering over the last two years about the concept that "robots will take over our jobs" by increased automation of processes in the workplace. What does the general public think about artificial intelligence? The science academy found that although most of the UK general public does not know what the term "machine learning" means, they have all interacted with the technology simply by using apps and online services. Concerns about the use of machine learning vary depending on the industry – on the whole, most people were positive about the technology being used to improve healthcare and develop medicines that would improve lifespan and quality of life, or about the technology being used to tackle global problems like food shortages. However, people were concerned about the potential for machines to replace them in the workplace and whether autonomous machines, like self-driving cars, would be safe. There were also societal concerns that machine learning would make human existence less personal, so where once driving could have been considered as a hobby to de-stress, it would be eradicated by self-driving cars. And while social networks tailoring user experience would ensure that users see content that they would like, it might also cause them to live in a "bubble" and miss out on other things going on in the world. Decisions about machine learning need to be made now View photos The many potential benefits of machine learningMore The Royal Society says that there are clearly a great many benefits to machine learning, from improving medical diagnoses, drug development and speeding up scientific discoveries to tailoring education to meet students' individual strengths, identifying people who would most benefit from public services, speeding up legal processes and even enabling self-driving cars to stay safe on the roads. Read More However, rather than allow the technology to organically develop, careful guidance and stewardship is required by policymakers, academia and industry over the next decade. Since machine learning can be used in many industries, students in schools and universities must be made aware of how the technology works and the importance of ensuring they make the right decisions with the data available, keeping it secure. This is especially a concern in fields where the profession has a duty of care to people, such as in healthcare or law. Dealing with bias and a skills shortage The science academy also recommends that courses on data science include modules on ethics to help train people to avoid bias when designing computer algorithms, and increased allocation of PhD places for machine learning to meet the severe shortage of people trained in the field. Research is also needed to define and investigate potential issues with machine learning so that the technology continues to benefit the country as a whole, rather than a few select companies. "There's an acute shortage of people trained in this field, some tech companies can offer much better salaries and resources. We want to do everything to make the academic world more attractive, or to have a world where there is one foot in academia and one in industry," Professor Peter Donnelly FRS, chair of the report's working group, Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics and Professor of Statistical Science at the University of Oxford, said at the press conference. "It is clear to us that the world we're in at the moment, with the data being collected about us from our phones and other devices – this world has outgrown the existing framework. There needs to be a new framework for governance of data. Some sectors will require more regulation, like healthcare, but others, like a company reorganising its warehouse, will need less. We as a society need to decide how algorithms work, should they be fair and unbiased, should they be transparent?" You may be interested in: Which defendants are likely to be a flight risk?

Name: Subject: Message: Google will now translate any restaurant review to your local language Newsby John Callaham6 hours ago 128 11 If you are an international traveler, one of the first things you want to do when you get to a new country is check out its local cuisine. However, even if you have a smartphone that can find reviews of local restaurants, you may not be able to read them if they are in a language you don’t understand. Today, Google says it will solve that problem by providing translated restaurant and point of interest reviews in its main Search app as well as in Google Maps. See also: Google Translate 5.8 update introduces word definitions and account switcher 4 weeks ago The new feature will show the review in the translated language version on top, as set on your device, with the original version on the bottom. As Google points out, this gets rid of the need to copy those reviews and paste the words in a translation app or website. Of course, if you are not quite sure that Google’s automatic translation is accurate, you still have the original review to check out in case someone who speaks the language can read it and translate it for you. While this is admittedly a minor addition to Google’s services, it’s still a very welcome one, especially for people who like to see the world.

Since that time, Google has worked with GoPro and now Yi to create Jump rigs for the two company’s cameras. If you could, would you purchase a jump camera rig to capture 360-degree videos? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases These days, most handheld 360-degree video cameras typically only cost somewhere between $200 and $400 depending on how small they are and how high-quality the footage is. This is decent price drop compared to the price of cameras two or three years ago, mainly thanks to companies such as LG and Samsung who have built them as companion devices to work with its flagship smartphones. The issues with such devices, though, is that the quality is decent but is not nearly good enough for professionals. That is where Jump comes in. Using around 16 cameras, these rigs can capture crystal clear video footage as well as use specialized software to make sure there is very little stitching between video clips. The problem for most people looking to pick one up is the cost. Including the price of all 16 cameras, the entire setup could set you back as much as $17,000.

I don't mean to imply this annual tradition has no value, but do you remember what won last year? Hey, maybe this one will be different. Google seems to be making a bigger deal of it. There are 12 total categories including best game, best app, best social impact, best app for kids, and so on. Each one has five finalists, which will be whittled down to one at I/O—specifically on Thursday, May 18th at 6:30pm. The nomination and award process is handled internally at Google, so it's all very vague. The blog post says the selection relies upon "high star rating, technical performance, and freshness." Some of the finalists are befuddling, like Lineage 2 Attack (Revolution) in the games category—it really doesn't look like a game. The indie game category has some very good titles, though.

Let's Speculate Wildly Juicero: The Story So Far The Little Known Scandals And Conspiracies Of Einstein 7 Android Apps That Actually Work Properly On A Chromebook David Nield Apr 25, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  android apps chrome os fieldguide Share If you haven't heard, a lot of Chromebooks can run Android apps now, but not everything in the Google Play Store is going to make sense for your lightweight laptop — we're looking at you, Snapchat.Here are seven Android apps that are actually well suited to running on top of Chrome OS. Shockingly not a single one comes from Adobe. The company has optimised all of its mobile apps for Chrome OS, but they still feel unmistakably like mobile apps — not desktop ones. The seven apps you'll find on this list actually feel like they belong in a world of keyboards and trackpads. 1) Quik Image: Screenshot Online apps can do a decent job in most situations, but one area where they definitely lag behind their video counterparts is in video editing. While most Chromebooks won't have the grunt for serious video editing work, a lightweight app like Quik can do wonders for some quick and dirty cutting. We wouldn't suggest it for piecing together a short film, but it's perfect if you just want to cut footage of the kids and send it to friends and family. It's one of our favourite picks for editing on mobile devices, and it looks great on a Chromebook too. Now owned and developed by GoPro, Quik doesn't just let you do simple cuts, it also allows you to add music, choose filters, and even overlay some really cool text onto your videos. It's not the most advanced app out there, but the results are impressive enough that you might not miss iMovie. Quik (free) 2) Instagram Image: Screenshot This is one instance where having a Chromebook definitely beats having a computer running Windows or MacOS. Instagram is available on the web, but in a cut-down, half-baked form, so get the Android version loaded up on your Chromebook: you can import and upload files from just about anywhere, scroll through your feed, view the new Stories format, and so on and so on. Plus, having that Chromebook keyboard makes it easier to message people and tap out those witty comments. The app hasn't been fully optimised for Chrome OS just yet (it still lives in a square box), but it's still fully functional and easy to operate from your laptop. Instagram (free) 3) Dropbox Paper Image: Screenshot Google and Microsoft have capable online office suites you can use on your Chromebook, but the Android versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint aren't currently compatible with the best of the current batch of Android-enabled Chromebooks and sometimes it's nice to get away from the all seeing eye of Google. To plug the processor gap, try Dropbox Paper. Improved offline support is one reason to go for this app over the online alternatives, and in general it's a cleaner, more capable take on the old word processor idea. The interface works fine on a larger screen, and your keyboard and trackpad should work flawlessly too. Dropbox Paper (free) 4) Spotify Image: Screenshot File this one under "instances where the Android app is better than the web version", which is fairly obvious when you think about it. Spotify's web player is fine and everything, but the Android version is better, and as a bonus it even looks good on a big screen. On top of that you can cache playlists for offline listening of course, so you've got something to rock out to when your internet goes down or you're stuck on a train. With the magic of Spotify Connect you can beam tunes to other hardware from Chrome OS. Spotify (free) 5) Firefox Chrome OS is essentially just Chrome, which makes it kind of tricky to install another browser. But sometimes you don't want Google knowing your every online move. If you like the appealing price tag of Chromebooks, but aren't crazy about using Google for every single thing on your computer then download Firefox for Android. It gives you an alternative browser (albeit in a form optimised for mobile), complete with desktop syncing capabilities. That means if you use Firefox on another computer you can sync all of your stuff straight to your Chromebook. Firefox for Android also comes with plenty of other features to make use of, including smart searches, an intuitive tab system, and a huge library of add-ons. Firefox (free) 6) Alto's Adventure Image: Screenshot Another area where Android apps are streets ahead of web apps is gaming, and we could've picked almost any game here. We've gone for Alto's Adventure as it looks gorgeous in landscape mode, and is compatible with trackpads (so the screen stays unobstructed). It's also just a great endless runner-style game. If you're new to the world of Alto's Adventure, the idea is to last as long as you can on a downhill snowboard run, picking up points for catching llamas, performing tricks, and escaping Elders on the mountain. Alto's Adventure (free) 7) Gmail Image: Screenshot Yes, yes, yes, you can access Gmail through your web browser — but the Android app looks particularly elegant on larger screens, and comes with a few tricks the web interface doesn't have, including customisable alerts you can switch on and off for individual labels. The Android app also handles multiple Google accounts better than the web version does, and the interface is a little bit neater too. What's more, you can swipe messages to plough through them more quickly, using your Chromebook's touchscreen or built-in trackpad. Gmail (free) WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Join the discussion!

Roll Your Own Unroll.me With A Google Script Thorin Klosowski Apr 25, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  clutter email gmail newsletters unsubscribe Share Unroll.me, the newsletter unsubscription service, was just busted selling off more data than most of us thought possible, so it goes without saying that many are dumping the service altogether. Good news though, a Google Script can unsubscribe you from a ton of emails almost just as easily. While Unroll.me's primary feature was not just its ability to one-click unsubscribe, but to also "roll up" all the newsletters you do want, sometimes you have to make some sacrifices for the sake of privacy. Over at Digital Inspiration, Amit Agarwal put together a Google Script for bulk unsubscribing to newsletters. The idea for how this works is pretty straightforward: first, you go through your inbox and mark any newsletter you no longer want with the label "Unsubscribe." Then, the Google Script parses the content of bulk emails, find the unsubscribe link, then automatically follows that link. With this script, you do not need to grant access to your Gmail account to any third party services, it just uses the Google account and services you already have. Plus, you can apply the "Unsubscribe" label from any third-party email client, the Gmail app, or the normal web app. Sure, it's an extra, manual step, but it's still easier than clicking every single link individually and you don't have to worry about your data being sold off to a third-party. As with any Google Script, the installation here takes a couple of steps: Copy the Gmail Unsubscriber sheet to your Google Drive. In that Google Sheet, click the Gmail Unsubscriber link in the top bar then click Configure. Allow the script to access your Gmail account. Don't worry the script doesn't store any data anywhere outside your own Google Account. Save the configuration with the default name. Head over to your Gmail inbox, then create a label called Unsubscribe. Select any emails you want to unsubscribe to, then apply the Unsubscribe label to them. It might take 10-15 minutes, but eventually you'll start to see a list of the emails you've marked form inside the Google Sheet alongside a note saying whether or not the script was successful. Once the script is set up, you no longer need to look at it unless you're just curious. Otherwise, going forward, you just need to label an email as Unsubscribe and the rest happens behind the scenes. You can find more information about how exactly the Google Script works and some more advanced information over at Digital Inspiration.

I'm not going to pre-empt my review as it's still a work in progress. But The Dell, MacBook and several other systems on the market have decided to put all their eggs in the USB-C basket. And that's proving to be an epic pain with suitable devices, cables and other peripherals still relatively hard to get. Why Does Every Car Infotainment System Look So Crappy? Thorin Klosowski 24 Apr 2017 1:00 PM Cadillac has perhaps the ugliest option of the bunch User interface design is hard, but we've been getting better at it over the years to the point where even a thermostat is easy to use. Automakers, however, seem to have their heads in the sand, taking their design inspiration for their infotainment consoles from old Winamp skins instead of any type of modern interface.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Dave Bennett Remap Galaxy S8’s Bixby button to launch Google Now with this app Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal April 24th, 2017 at 6:57 PM Share Tweet For as much praise as the Galaxy S8 has received from critics, there is one feature that hasn’t received many compliments: Bixby, Samsung’s (unnecessary) answer/companion to Google Assistant. As our own Zach Epstein noted in his review, the curiously-named AI assistant doesn’t even appear to be fully functional upon release, which makes the dedicated Bixby hardware button even more perplexing. Don't Miss: First Galaxy S9 details emerge in new report Many future Galaxy S8 owners were disappointed to learn that there would be no official way to remap the button to activate another feature or app on the phone that they might actually use, but a free app called BixRemap recently appeared on Google Play to give all of those future S8 owners an out. “A simple app I designed in 20 minutes,” developer Dave Bennett explains. “It launches Google Now when you hit the Bixby button (Google will Launch over the Bixby app). If there’s any more interest in this, I can develop this further. Just a test app at the moment.” As Bennett makes clear in the app description, this is neither a permanent nor an especially well-designed solution for remapping the Bixby button, but it is a compelling proof of concept for those who don’t want to have a hardware button go to waste on the side of their Galaxy S8 or S8+. A few notes before you rush to download BixRemap: the app requires you to allow usage tracking, Bixby will actually launch before Google Now and a notification will appear in the notification tray every time you use BixRemap. If that’s not enough to dissuade you, BixRemap is a serviceable solution.

Parking availability was determined to be either 'Easy', 'Medium', or 'Limited', based on historical parking data collected by Google. Now, in a teardown of the latest Google Maps beta v9.51 by Android Police, that feature seems to be getting an upgrade. With the latest update, Google has added an 'On-site' level, informing drivers whether their destination has parking, or if they would have to search for a parking spot nearby. It also shows if the parking is free or paid, but does not include the actual cost if it's the latter. The information is still extrapolated from historical data, so real-time parking availability is still a goal to look forward to. However, this subtle hint will surely help the average city dweller, who typically dedicates about four days of a year looking for parking space, per a recent study by the British Parking Association. In addition to that, Android Police also found a bunch of strings hinting towards some interesting upcoming features. The first set of strings suggests that Google Maps would offer users an option to add a parking spot near their destination to their route. After parking the vehicle, Maps would either show walking directions or other means of travel, leading to the destination. The second feature is only backed by a single string and relies on the enormous amounts of data collected by Google about city traffic and its density. Since information about this feature is scarce, not much is clear, but it appears that Google would estimate the traffic density on a route using historical data, and display it as a chart. These two features are mere speculation based on the strings found by Android Police in the teardown; regardless of how convincing they may sound, plans can change, and there is no guarantee that we would see these two features anytime soon. Google wants to make cities smarter, and its co-founder, Larry Page, has dedicated an entire startup to the mission of “improving city life for everyone”. A smart city relies on data collected and logged by every function of the city – data that Google can use in its products, and increase the value of its services. Helping motorists with parking may just be the beginning of what’s to come.

BENGALURU: Google India honoured one of the greatest Kannada actors, Dr Rajkumar, by dedicating a doodle to him on his 88th birth anniversary on Monday. The doodle is a sketch of the actor in a movie with the audience watching it. It appears to have been inspired by Dadasaheb Phalke award winning movie ‘Kasturi Nivasa’ starring Dr Rajkumar. Puneeth Rajkumar singing at a programme to mark Dr Rajkumar’s 88th birth anniversary in Bengaluru on Monday  | Vinod Kumar T The actor passed away on April 12, 2006 at the age of 77. He had worked in over 200 films and sung some of the best hits of his era. He was honored with a doctorate by the University of Mysore for his contribution to films. Rajkumar was the stage name of Singanalluru Puttaswamayya Muthuraju. Even before it was released, Google had teased film buffs asking them to identify the subject of its next doodle, with a silhouette sketch of the actor in a mythological character. After the doodle went live in India, Google tweeted: Actor, singer, legend. Remembering the great #Rajkumar on his 88th birth anniversary. Soon after, Google started a thread asking twitterati to name the best film of the actor. During the day, several Kannada actors took to Twitter to pay tributes to the matinee idol. Among them was actor-director Rakshith Shetty. “Happy Birthday to the Legend, the face of Kannada Cinema, to our Annavru. This is so awesome. Check this out,” he tweeted and shared the doodle. Cricketer Anil Kumble and actor Ragini were among those who hailed the actor on his birth anniversary.

The company already uses about 4 million gallons of surface water per day, writes the Post & Courier (via Mashable). Google has studied various options for cooling its servers and has found that pumping groundwater was the best solution. The request comes at a time when a commercial boom in the area has led to companies (and residents) using water at a faster rate than the aquifers can replenish. Scientists are currently studying the area’s water situation, attempting to determine how much water from the aquifers can be used before depleting supplies of groundwater. Tech companies that operate large data centers are putting a great deal of focus on water and energy use. Data centers used about 165 billion gallons of water to cool their servers and for the energy to power their facilities. That number is expected to rise to about 174 billion gallons in 2020, according to figures from the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.   Companies that don’t plan for the long-term when it comes to water risks are playing defense rather than offense, Josh Henretig*, senior director of environmental sustainability at Microsoft, told Environmental Leader last week. “They’re not able to make smart investments in new technologies and in mitigation efforts that would move production from one facility to another. They’re putting their brands and their reputations at risk.” Microsoft has recently increased its focus on water use for its data centers. The company examines where water scarcity issues exist, where the company operates, the costs associated with water withdrawal, the risk-adjusted prices for water based on the availability and the quality of water at those specific sites, Henretig said. For example, a Microsoft data center in San Antonio, Texas, still relied on cooling towers which largely depend on water. By evaluating water use in that location, the company realized it had critical operations in a water-stressed region. And looking at the cost of water for that facility, the company made the decision to invest more deeply in new technology to save water. That led to a direct investment in the data center, from water meters to other technologies, in order to make better use of recycled water. It resulted in a $140,000-a-year cost savings, and a 58-million-gallon avoidance of fresh water use at that data center per year. * Note: Henretig will be speaking on this topic at the Environmental Leader 2017 Conference in June.   Categories EL Conference, Facilities, Feature, Water Leveraging EHS Software in Support of Culture Changes Sponsored By: VelocityEHS    Choosing the Correct Emission Control Technology Sponsored By: Anguil Environmental Systems    Environmental Leader Product and Project Awards 2016 Sponsored By: Environmental Leader    Practical Guide to Transforming Energy Data into Better Buildings Sponsored By: Lucid    Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

News sign-up Google eyes TV ad market News, 25 April 2017 Topics Programmatic buying MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA: Google, the internet giant, has announced that it is bringing the buying of television advertising into its ad tech platform to enable advertisers to run their video campaigns more easily and effectively. "By adding traditional TV buying into DoubleClick Bid Manager, we are taking the first step towards allowing advertisers and agencies to manage their video campaigns across digital and linear TV, in a more efficient and effective way," Rany Ng, Director, Product management at Google, wrote in a blog post. That includes the extension of programmatic buying technology to this space and access to new advertisers for television networks and station owners. "With their inventory now available through DoubleClick Bid Manager, television networks and station owners get access to new types of buyers, such as advanced TV buying groups in agencies, digital-first advertisers, and even global advertisers," said Ng. But Advertising Age noted a lack of detail around the networks taking part and the extent of inventory and household reach; MediaPost cited a Videology report which showed that more than half of advertisers lacked a clear understanding of the difference between programmatic and addressable TV. And Jim Nail, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, observed that Google unsuccessfully tried something similar several years ago. "Times are a bit different, but it is highly unlikely [Google's DoubleClick] is getting anything other than remnant inventory," he said. "Or the best you might say," he added, "is maybe the networks are putting a small amount of inventory in to dip a toe in the water at this point." Whatever the inventory, Ng was also offering impact-based metrics: "For example, an advertiser will be able to measure the lift when someone searches for their brand on Google or YouTube after seeing their TV ad."

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Google Assistant can now turn you into a wannabe bird whisperer Khari Johnson@kharijohnson April 24, 2017 3:55 PM Above: Golden Eagle Image Credit: Cosmo_71 About 25 news actions have landed on Google Home for Google Assistant including an action to hear the sounds of hundreds of bird songs and one that transforms into the person in your office who says innocuous, buzzword-laden things in meetings. More than 175 actions have been made available on the Google Home app since the launch of the Actions on Google platform last December. Actions are the voice apps third party developers can create for Google Assistant. In recent weeks, the third party ecosystem of actions has grown to include a WikiHow action for thousands of DIY instructions and a Bible reader that can read scripture based on how you feel. The Bird Song Skill from Thomptronics can play more than two hundred bird sounds, from a wild turkey to half a dozen swan species to the Veery, which is said to have one of the most beautiful bird songs in all of North America. Without the need of any action, Google Assistant can tell you what a swan or hummingbird sound like but it cannot tell you about a grey wagtail or a black browed albatross. If you get especially good at your ability to recognize the birds, Bird Song Skill has a song quiz. I can’t wait for an action like this to take into account my location so you learn the sounds of birds in your immediate surroundings. Continuing a trend of actions made for public transit times in major cities, the Atlanta rail action was recently made available to tell Atlanta metro area residents about the next bus or train arrival time. Another noteworthy new action is The Virtual Concierge. The action (and its accompanying Alexa skill) were made by Dana Young for guests staying at The Lodge in Palmer Lake, Wash. By saying “Talk to the virtual concierge,” a vacation rental or Airbnb guest can be told about house rules, or ask questions about things like the Wi-Fi password, nearby restaurant recommendations, and a range of other things a property may want a guest to know. A large part of the new batch of actions is related to characters and storytelling. Value Adder is an action that mimics the innocuous things people say in business settings like “The key takeaway here is that we need to collaboratively pursue collective synergy” or “If you ask me i think we should continually develop scalable niches.” To call on the action, say “OK, Google, ask Value Adder to add value to this meeting.” The Misfortunate Cookie action will tell you about mild misfortunes like someone blocking your way to escalator, kids with sticky hands, or soggy fries. Each cookie opened is another misfortune. The Temple at the End of the Forest tells a story and gives you clues to unlock riddles along the way. Story Tree is a lot like The Magic Door, an action that gives multiple choices in a story landscape driven by sound effects and characters. The Earth Day action can tell you about how to do something to address issues like deforestation, biodiversity, and climate change on earthday.org. Also made to make to spread knowledge about the world around us is the Farmer’s Almanac. Like Ben Franklin’s encyclopedic book, this action will tell you things like the number of days to summer, that “today is the best day to destroy pest or weeds” or what a rabbit and hunting for eggs have to do with Easter. Mercedes and Hyundai recently launched actions to give owners of their vehicles control of their cars via Alexa or Google Assistant. The Mercedes Me action can unlock car door, start the car engine, or take navigation directions. Last week, Google Assistant on Home devices gained the ability to support multiple accounts and recognize the unique voices of up to six people. The lack of an ability to personalize your experience (and work address and payments and calendar) was an initial criticism from critics of the intelligent assistant.

Google Fit v1.64 for Wear 2.0 can now identify strength training exercises and automatically count reps [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/24 8:19am PDTApr 24, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares125 Android Wear Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Automatically track strength exercises 1.2 Unit Settings 2 Download Google Fit stands as one of Google's only flagship apps on Android Wear, and may be the only one of its apps that matters more on a watch than it does on a phone. There's a new version of the app available on the Play Store for both watches and phones, but this update is all about adding a big feature for Wear. There's a new mode for recording strength training and similar activities that involve counting reps. This update is for Wear 2.0 only, so quite a few people will have to wait until the rollout is complete before testing this out, but it works on the last developer preview as well as any watch that already has the official 2.0 firmware. What's New Official Changelog: Automatically track your strength training exercises on your Android Wear smartwatch. Minor improvements. Bug fixes. Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Settings for units of measure Automatically track strength exercises Did you pick up a Wear device with the intention of recording workouts, then found that there wasn't much you could get out of the box? Sure, you could look to other apps, but if you wanted to use Google Fit, it only supported a few specific activities like walking and running, bicycling, and push-ups; but this did nothing for the wide range of exercises that you can and should do to get in shape. The new version of Google Fit expands the tracking capabilities significantly with a new Strength Training tool that greatly increases the range of activities that can be measured. To launch the Strength Training tracker, either open the "Fit Workout" item from the app launcher on Wear or open the Fit app and tap on the pink button to begin an activity, then look through the list for Strength Training. Once your session is recording, Google Fit will analyze motion of the watch to determine what you're doing and how many reps you've completed. When your set is complete, tap the button at the bottom and Fit will present your rep count. If you're keeping track of the count in your head and the numbers don't match up, you can adjust the count by sliding the top number to the left or right. If you're using weights, you should also slide the second number to the left to record the actual weight. Then scroll down a bit to the buttons titled Save, Delete, or Save and Exit. Saving the set will open up a follow-up screen with a countdown for resting before beginning the next set. In my very brief test, Fit successfully guessed I was doing bicep curls. I'm not sure about the rep count on that one, I was busy fiddling with screenshots. On my second test, I happened to switch arms and change the orientation of the watch, and this may have been enough to fool Fit into thinking I had taken to doing sit-ups. If this happens, you can tap the name of the exercise at the top to set the correct activity. For what it's worth, the rep count was correct. Overall, this is a pretty big addition and makes Wear considerably more useful for fitness tracking, especially in the gym. The workflow might still be a little cumbersome if each new set is supposed to happen immediately after the last, but this is still fine for most traditional workouts. Note: This feature was technically available on the stock firmware for the LG Watch Sport and possibly Style when they were fresh out of the box, but it seemed to disappear with either a server-side switch or an update to the Fit app. With this update, it's back for those watches and now available for all other watches on Wear 2.0. Unit Settings There is one other change worth noting, although it probably go mostly ignored. If you find that the units of measurement aren't to your liking, they can now be changed right on the watch. Just open Google Fit, scroll to the bottom to find the button to open Settings, then tap on the Units button. You can make changes for Height, Weight, Distance, and Energy. Most people probably won't need this, but it's a little more important now that Wear is intended to operate with less reliance on a paired phone. It makes sense if some users don't set up the app on a phone before using it on a watch for the first time. There's no harm in having it there.

Most AW watches I see are pretty nice. Too nice to want to wear as I work out in a gym with free weights. Wouldn't this make more sense with a partnering fitness tracker that you could wear with or without a nice watch? Morten Ulv I work out with a Urbane 2nd ed. Don't really understand what the issues would be? Doug McHone Isn't that watch a nicer piece of wear than what you would typically have on while working up a sweat? It just seems out of place for that application to me. I would rather AW make a fitness tracker similar to a fitbit for swimming and rigorous exercising. Morten Ulv I guess I just don't mind. I guess it could be nice with a fitness tracker companion, but then you might as well just use some existing one? Fitbit doesn't natively sync with Google Fit though, but there are workarounds. I use the watch for music as well (and calls since the Fitness Center watch my kids while I work out and call me if something is up), and then a fitness tracker wouldn't work. John Doe What happened to all the health tracking stuff? http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/01/25/google-play-services-v10-2-prepares-for-google-fit-v2-api-and-fido-certified-security-keys-apk-teardown/ Cody Toombs What do you mean? It hasn't launched yet. John Doe I thought it would launch with Android Wear 2.0. You know, Google Fit v2.0 and Android Wear 2.0? "Rumors have circulated for a while that Fit v2.0 will launch alongside Android Wear 2.0 next month." Cody Toombs Yeah, it definitely would have made sense, but it seems like they're still holding this back. Given that it didn't happen with Wear 2.0, and we're already staring down the barrel of I/O, the odds are pretty good that it will be announced (and probably released) next month. John Doe Google is really fucking things up with Android wear. It would be very embarrassing if I/O is here and all Android wear watches that were promised to be updated are not updated by that time. surethom Still not heart rate monitor Liam Alexander Colman This is also available on my Moto 360 Sport which hasn't been updated yet. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/76b7df372790b088b874c4e00d18392755bba1454b663e00ea922c85b82e6af3.jpg Antti Elonheimo I was about to comment the same. Haven't​ yet tested it out though. Liam Alexander Colman I have done some push ups and it worked ;) Antti Elonheimo Did it record heart rate data for you? I tested it also and it didn't. During rest it showed heart rate with something like "HR: --" under the timer. Don't know if something is wrong or not. It doesn't even show that in the screenshots in AP article. Liam Alexander Colman Yep same with the HR for me. Counts the reps though perfectly! Chewieez Same here. I used it today on my moto 360 sport. It automatically recognized jumping jacks and push ups and squats. It missed side lunges, but it was easy to input the workout. HR didn't seem to be recorded. surethom Google fit wear app is good but it's missing regular heart rate monitoring & sleep tracking F4LL0U7 Agreed, if they could keep the heart rate monitor active during your workouts, it would be great. F4LL0U7 They'd also need to let us do something with that information. When I manually measure my heartrate, that info seems to just disappear. Vadim Shun I cannot imagine it being able to detect pull-ups, chin-ups and headstand push- ups which are staple of my routine in a gym since hands in these exercises are largely stationary in these positions. Also still cannot take watch for activities such as whitewater kayaking so, while helpful for some, the app will still be disabled for me to save on battery. Morten Ulv I just tested chin-ups and it detected it perfectly. No clue how it does it though. Too weak to do headstand push-ups though, sorry! ;) Morten Ulv Detected push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, bicep curls without fault. Bench press was detected as Overhead press, but I just faked it on a sofa, so that might have caused it. Was easy to change it manually though (came up as first alternative). Maximilian Keppeler As a developer of a Push-Ups app, is there an API for identifying exercises? (Push-Ups) Taa Ynwa You don't need AW 2.0 for this. This works perfectly fine on my LG Watch Urbane 2 running AW 1.5 and Google Fit 1.64. Jaime Lopez If you start Sports Gear Tracker on watch and start Fit strength training workout on watch, fit will show average heart rate on fit strength training workout summary. So , both are running at same time. If you teach fit what movement you did after it tries to guess (i.e.) hand stand push up, it will learn the movement. My watch also shows"HR--" so keep hoping it is coming. I have LG Urbane and use Barton quick change bands to make it more workout suitable.

I don't mean to imply this annual tradition has no value, but do you remember what won last year? Hey, maybe this one will be different. Google seems to be making a bigger deal of it. There are 12 total categories including best game, best app, best social impact, best app for kids, and so on. Each one has five finalists, which will be whittled down to one at I/O—specifically on Thursday, May 18th at 6:30pm. The nomination and award process is handled internally at Google, so it's all very vague. The blog post says the selection relies upon "high star rating, technical performance, and freshness." Some of the finalists are befuddling, like Lineage 2 Attack (Revolution) in the games category—it really doesn't look like a game. The indie game category has some very good titles, though. You can see the full list of nominees and categories on the Play Store. Source: Google Tags apps Games Google google play google play awards video subscribe ...

San Jose’s airport was one of the first, but now it appears that you’ll be able to find a Fi “Travel Trolley” in 9 different airports. Everyone can use an Echo Dot: Just $50! Beyond San Jose, you’ll now find be able to find a Trolley at Philadelphia International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Midway International Airport in Chicago, Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport, Sacremento International Airport, Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and Raleigh-Durham International Airport. As we reported last year, these Travel Trolleys are packed to the brim with lots of different kinds of travel-related accessories: eye masks, socks, charging cables, and more. See the full list below for exact terminals and gates where you can find these free goodies. You can also share your experience at a Trolley with the hashtag #FlyWithFi for a chance to win a free Google Pixel, Google says. With the Project Fi Travel Trolley, we’re hoping to make traveling just a little more pleasant by providing travel-related goodies at the airport. Keep an eye out for a Travel Trolley at the following airports: PHL, Terminal F, just prior to the first gate ORD, Terminal 3, between concourse K and H MDW, Terminal 1, between Gate A5 & A3 SJC, Terminal B, across from Gate 25 MSP, Terminal 1, Concourse G SAC, Terminal B, across from Gate 12 BUR, Terminal A, gate A3 SEA, Concourse A, gate A3 RDU, Terminal 2 When you use the Travel Trolley, make sure to share your experience on Twitter using “#FlyWithFi”. Our favorite wins a Pixel phone. See details and terms. While the Project Fi Travel Trolley will always provide goodies for subscribers, we’re also giving non-subscribers a chance to redeem a gift through our Fi Travel Trivia game. Make sure to give it a shot next time you see a Travel Trolley. For more information on the Project Fi Travel Trolley, check out our Help Center article. Save some space for us in your carry-on!

Better admin controls for Docs offline access First up, Google is making it easier for G Suite administrators to control users’ access to offline Docs, Sheets, and Slides files. Today, we’re making it easier for admins to balance those interests by introducing settings in the Admin console for managing users’ access to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides files offline. Admins will have two options to pick from: controlling offline access using device policies (which requires a bit more work to set up), or allowing users to enable offline access. In the latter case, which is the method Google recommends, users will have to manually activate offline access and confirm that the device they’re using is not a public or shared device. “These settings only apply to Docs, Sheets, and Slides in a Chrome browser on a desktop computer,” Google says. If you previously allowed users to enable offline access for themselves, that setting will remain selected when these features launch. Alternatively, if you did not, you’ll have to take the additional steps mentioned above to get things up and running for your users. Email Log Search improvements Also announced today, Google is launching some changes to Email Log Search in G Suite. Now, Google says email admins can search subject, and has changed email policies so that they are now linked in the email log. “You will be able to know which of your email policies triggered which action and make modifications to your policies by clicking on a link to the relevant policy,” the blog post says. Both of these updates are scheduled for a full rollout within the next few days. Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google. Twitter DMs are open.

"As the poor folks at Snapchat are finding, these companies can crush even well-capitalized companies like Snapchat, by just knocking off their features," Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab, told CNBC's "Closing Bell" on Monday. Recently public, Snap makes its money from advertising. Despite Snapchat's popularity, eMarketer projects that it will account for only about 1.3 percent of the U.S. mobile ad market this year. Meanwhile, Facebook has introduced copycat features to rival Snapchat. One solution, Taplin said, is to treat companies like Google as a "utility" that's required to share its patents with the rest of the community. Google does make many of its products available to developers and consumers for free, and many tech innovations actually reduce prices for consumers — not typical of an economic monopoly. Still, Taplin said, "you could argue that Google is a natural monopoly." "The problem is, the rise of Google, Facebook and Amazon has meant the fall of the creative economy," Taplin said citing falling profits in industries like books, newspapers, music and movies. In an opinion piece for The New York Times this week, Taplin argued that rather than drive down the cut that musicians and artists get for their work, the tech giants need to share more of their revenue. "They need to be more generous with the creative community or there won't be a creative community," Taplin said.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Play Services 11 adds more details to cast notifications Newsby John Callaham8 hours ago 132 8 If you use your Android device to cast content like video or audio to other devices, such as a TV or a connected speaker, you may soon get some additional information when that happens on your network. A new report says that the new Google Play Services update to version 11 includes those new Google Cast notification changes. See also: Best Chromecast apps for Android 3 weeks ago If you and some other folks are each using an Android smartphone or tablet on your local network, all of them currently get a notification when just one of them is casting content to another connected device. However, this also allows anyone else who gets that notification to control or end that cast. Now, according to Android Police, the update to Google Play Services 11 shows a slightly different message, stating, “A device on your Wi-Fi is casting”. This updated notification message still allows anyone on the network to take over that casting, but at least they will know if you are trying to cast your favorite YouTube video to your 60-inch TV, so they might not accidentally interrupt it. Since this is rolling out via the Google Play Services 11 update, the new notifications could take a few days to reach your phone. By the way, you can stop those cast notifications on other devices on your network, but at the moment it has to be done manually on each device. Hopefully, Google will find a way to remotely end these notifications, without having to go and disable them on each and every device, in a future update.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 393 Share on Facebook 119 Share on Twitter Total Shares594 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Jason Brown Given the more-more-more with less-less-less approach of modern news media, I'm astounded they have the time to monitor reader feedback. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. John Marshall’s Ghost Thank you for your response. This is the hallmark of professionalism. Typically, I wouldn't say anything but this is a) my wheelhouse and b) the whole "maximize shareholder value" is a pet peeve of mine because people think it's law when it's not and that has been the basis of 35+ years of failed economic policy (i.e., trickle down economics) and the justification for offshoring jobs. But, thank you again for the response. I thought your article was very well written and I hope this didn't come across as critical. I have done this to the NY Times, The Atlantic and various other organizations. Yours is the only article that has ever responded appropriately. Keep up the good work! 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Christopher Robert I'll bet you money there is a FB employee who reads messages. There is no way 100% of the messages are handled without any human oversight. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't? Railwayman Some interesting theories here. One thing I have a hard time to understand is this logic: "SMS fallback is not supported because Google doesn't make money off SMS" - OK, they don't make any more money from SMS even with a separate client. So if that would be the case, then they would just use the basic AOSP SMS client with absolutely no frills (just the barebones). Since we are talking Google/Alphabet it is a bit hard to see how it can bring "more revenue" to have a lot of different messaging apps. It is one thing that we have WhatsApp, Viber, Skype etc since it is... different companies and they want your money but here we have one company. I just fail to see how it can bring more revenue when you use Google Allo instead of Google Hangouts. Or using Google Duo instead of Google Hangouts. Or... IF there would be any kind of "sensible business" here - i.e. that "many messaging apps=increased revenue" then we would see other companies following suit. I.e. WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Trio, WhatsApp Friends&Family, WhatsApp GetTogether, WhatsApp Connect and so on - IF we buy into the thesis that "many messaging apps=increased revenue". Yet... we don't see this kind of strategy from the competition. Apple, which care a lot about their revenues would also have a couple of different messengers *if* there would be a strong business case here. I can't believe for a second that they would just keep iMessage and FaceTime if there would be a compelling business case of having a couple of other options. To recap: It doesn't make any business sense to develop a lot of different apps from *the same company* for the very basic thing of "messaging". A more appropriate strategy is to make *one* major service and to make it really good. It is actually pretty simple and no excuses about "business cases with many messengers" change it even a little bit. Android need: Android Messenger Description: Android Messenger is the default messaging client in the Android OS. It supports SMS (carrier and Google Voice), RCS and Android Messages instant messages (based off Hangouts). It automatically select Android Messages when the recipient has AM on their device, otherwise RCS with SMS fallback. All messages are automatically backed up to the cloud and integrated with Gmail. The user can setup Android Messenger using their SIM based number, GV number or Gmail address and it is done when the setup guide is running on first boot unless the account is configured already. Android Messenger work on smartphones, tablets and computers - every device that can sign in to a Gmail account is compatible since AM is part of Gmail. When you setup Gmail you simply get AM as well. Android Messenger is the standard client on Android devices shipped with G-Apps and is also the basic part of every G-App package. Android Messenger can be plugged in with a dialer tab for Google Voice accounts and is also seamlessly integrated with the Contacts app. I.e. all messages goes through AM. This would make sense and bring a viable competitor to iMessage. Explanations along the lines of "the business case of having several messages", "the carriers don't like default messaging apps", "Samsung doesn't like default messaging apps" and so on are just... excuses for a messed up system. Google can roll out Android Messenger for the simple reason that they have a dominating platform. What should the carrier do? Every Android device has AM so... their only option then would be to sell iPhone only BUT... they can't put their own client on there EITHER. So should they go back to selling feature phones? And Samsung? Telling Google that they are going to use Tizen if they can't put their own SMS client on? Especially now when they accepted GPM as their music player. I can say this: No OEM or carrier are going to stop using or selling Android because Google roll out Android Messenger in O or P. It is not exactly that way that we are going to see a "mass exodus" from the platform because they decided to integrate AM. If anyone seriously believe that Android is commonplace because the messaging app can be replaced by either "OEM Messenger" or "Carrier Messenger" I must recommend a reality check. And no, I don't think there will be any platform suddenly getting traction because "we hate instant messengers and we boycott Android but embrace new platform X because we can replace its messaging client". Especially not today when the carriers offer "unlimited texting". So Google can create a unified Android Messenger and push it on all devices without any problems with boycott or mass exodus of partners and carriers. The question is rather if they are able to assemble all their different teams and merge them in order to create Android Messenger. One thing is for sure: They have a lot to gain and very little to loose since such a client would get a lot of traction at the expense of WhatsApp and the likes by being integrated and the default option. Immediately when there are two devices with O or P for example everything is just... set and the messages are heading down the Google street. So if Google want to maximize revenue from messages, then this is the way to go - especially with Assistant integration.

Google has allocated more ad space above search results. Photo: LOIC VENANCE, AFP/Getty Images A Google gold mine below the search bar 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Before Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded Google, they wrote a research paper as doctoral students at Stanford University in which they questioned the appropriateness of ads on search engines. “It could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want,” the pair wrote in the 1998 paper. How times change. Two decades later, it’s not unusual for a smartphone user to see only ads on a Google search page before scrolling down to the regular results. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters When Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings this week, the Mountain View company’s big profits are expected to demonstrate yet again that the billboard space accompanying Google queries is the Web’s most valuable real estate for advertisements. In the 17 years since Google introduced text advertising above search results, the company has allocated more space to ads and created new forms of them. The ad creep on Google has pushed “organic” (unpaid) search results farther down the screen, an effect even more pronounced on the smaller displays of smartphones. The changes are profound for retailers and brands that rely on leads from Google searches to drive online sales. With limited space available near the top of search results, not advertising on search terms associated with your brand or displaying images of your products is tantamount to telling potential customers to spend their money elsewhere. The biggest development with search ads is the proliferation of product listing ads. In a departure from its text ads, Google started allowing retailers to post pictures, descriptions and prices of products at the top of search results in 2009. In recent years, Google has served more product ads and expanded their availability to more general search terms — for example, showing photo ads on a search for “running shoes,” not just “Nike Air Max.” It has also tinkered with the size, location and number of ads on results pages for both computers and smartphones. Retailers are snapping up product ads. They accounted for 52 percent of all Google search ad spending by retailers in the first quarter of 2017, versus 8 percent in 2011, according to the digital marketing agency Merkle. Having the ads “takes the search engine results page to a different level,” said Andy Taylor, Merkle’s associate director of research. A Google spokeswoman said the company’s goal had always been to quickly give people the best search results. “Our goal has always been to deliver results that people find immediately useful, which is even more important on mobile devices with smaller screens,” said the spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho. “For most queries, we show no ads, and we recently removed right-hand text ads for all queries. For highly commercial queries, our extensive testing shows that people find relevant ads and offers extremely useful.” The importance of being at the top of search results is fueling fierce competition for ads. Reef, a beachwear manufacturer best known for its sandals, said it increased spending with Google 76 percent last year — mainly because it nearly quadrupled the money it put into product ads. On a search result, Reef is competing with other manufacturers of flip-flops, as well as retail partners selling Reef sandals. On a desktop computer, a Google search for “Reef flip-flops” brought back three text ads above the search results — one from Reef, one from Zappos and one from Amazon — selling Reef sandals. There were also nine image product listing ads displaying different Reef sandals for sale; only three were offered by reef.com while the rest were from other retailers. On a mobile phone, Reef is competing with even more retailers. The same search brought back only Reef’s text ad, but below a scrolling carousel featuring more than 20 image ads for different types of Reef flip-flops. Only the first two images linked to reef.com. “We’re competing against each other,” Jessica Levens, director of e-commerce at Reef, said about the company’s retail partners. “We need to spend the dollars to defend that real estate.” Levens said the advertising strategy was effective, although she had to convince her chief financial officer about the wisdom of spending more. Those product campaigns helped triple sales that started from online queries, including instances where customers searched without including the Reef brand name. Google’s prospecting for ad sales has not been limited to the product listing ads. The company has introduced new forms of search advertising for automobiles, hotels and even home services such as plumbing. “It’s impossible to rely simply on organic” search, said Caitlin Aylward, a senior associate at L2, a research and advisory firm for consumer brands. “The winner in all this is Google.” Daisuke Wakabayashi is a New York Times writer.

The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several “flying car” prototypes being designed by Kitty Hawk, a startup in Mountain View. Photo: KITTY HAWK, NYT Silicon Valley takes on the flying car 1 / 1 Back to Gallery On a recent afternoon, an aerospace engineer working for a small Mountain View company called Kitty Hawk piloted a flying car above Clear Lake in Lake County. Kitty Hawk’s flying car, if you insisted on calling it a “car,” looked like something Luke Skywalker would have built out of spare parts. It was an open-seated, 220-pound contraption with room for one person, driven by eight battery-powered propellers that howled as loudly as a speedboat. The tech industry is fond of disrupting things, and lately automakers have been a big target. Cars that use artificial intelligence to drive themselves, for example, have been in development for a few years and can be spotted on roads in a number of cities. And now, coming onto the radar screen, are flying machines that do not exactly look like your parents’ Buick with wings. More than a dozen startups backed by deep-pocketed industry figures like Larry Page, a Google founder — along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, Uber and even the government of Dubai — are taking on the dream of the flying car. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters The approaches by the companies vary, and the realization of their competing visions seems far in the future, but they have one thing in common: a belief that one day regular people should be able to fly their own vehicles around town. There are challenges, with both the technology and government regulations. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn’t crazy. “I love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car,” said Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google’s self-driving project. “I hate the idea of my next-door neighbor having one.” Kitty Hawk, the company backed by Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year. The company has attracted intense interest because of Page and its chief executive, Sebastian Thrun, an influential technologist and self-driving-car pioneer who is the founding director of Google’s X lab. Page declined a request for an interview but said in a statement: “We’ve all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I’m excited that one day very soon I’ll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight.” During his recent test flight, Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joysticklike controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake. The flight, just 15 feet above the water, circled over the lake about 20 or 30 yards from shore, and after about five minutes Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock. The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the startup is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can now pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to “gain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer.” It is an unusual offer, since the company has not yet set a price for the vehicle, and Thrun’s and Page’s involvement can be taken as evidence that the company is aiming far beyond hobbyists. Still, Kitty Hawk is clearly targeting a new kind of transportation — flight that can be performed safely by most people and hopefully with government approval. “We have been in contact with the FAA, and we see the regulators as friends,” Thrun said in an interview. He agreed that concerns about vehicles flying over our heads were legitimate. “I believe that all of us have to work together to understand how new technologies will shape the future of society.” Two years ago, Thrun recruited two other pioneers, Robertson and Todd Reichert, who were aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spin-off company that won a coveted prize for a human-powered helicopter and set the land speed record for a bicycle last year. They are flying under a special Federal Aviation Administration category for ultralight aircraft that does not require a pilot’s license and is intended for recreational flying in uncongested areas. To add an extra margin of safety, the Kitty Hawk engineers are sticking to flying over open water. The company said the final commercial product will look different and be far quieter than the test model. For these vehicles to become a reality, the United States would need a whole new air traffic control system. In 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began developing an air traffic control system meant for managing all sorts of vehicles. One NASA developer described it as an air traffic control system “for a sky dark with drones.” Researchers hope testing can begin by 2019. Batteries are also an issue. While electric propeller-driven motors seem promising, today’s battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance, say a 30- or 50-mile commute. “How is this going to work? I don’t want to be a Debbie Downer, but we can’t even take our cell phones on airplanes today because of fears about battery fires,” said Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University, who is researching personal air transport for NASA.

Roston - Apr 24, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has taken the wraps off its next-generation Jump camera, the YI HALO, a camera rig made in partnership with the Chinese company Yi Technology. In total, the YI HALO features a total of 17 4K-resolution cameras including an Up camera to record content in every direction. Despite the large number of cameras, the camera rig is highly portable with a weight under 8lbs. As well, the battery used to power it all provides 100 minutes of video recording, enabling users to capture an appreciable amount of content before having to recharge. The Google Jump rig was first introduced in early March, and it brought with it a circular array of 16 GoPro action cameras. The rig is designed to record content that is ultimately merged into 360-degree videos for virtual reality purposes. The latest iteration of Google Jump, the YI HALO, is visually similar but notably more robust, featuring small action camera-sized Yi cameras alongside a small Yi-branded display. The camera rig works in conjunction with an Android app, which itself can be used to live preview the footage from a mobile device, as well as to remotely control the camera rig. The next-generation rig is designed to work natively with the Jump Assembler, the rig’s software for stitching the cameras’ footage into a single seamless 360-degree video. Creators who are interested in getting the camera will have two options: purchase it when it launches this summer (pricing is unclear at this time) or score a free unit from Google via its newly announced Jump Start program. Under Jump Start, Google will provide some filmmakers with the camera for free (to use), as well as the Jump Assembler that produces the virtual reality footage. More than 100 creators will be selected this year, with applications for the program being open until May 22.

South Africa 25 Apr 2017 12:02 (South Africa) In the information age, the public has more agency than ever. Citizen science is streaking ahead, thanks to vast data contributions by ordinary people. In South Africa, one local ecologist just made it much easier for them to do so, whether they know it or not. By MARELISE VAN DER MERWE. “What do we want? Evidence-based science! When do we want it? After peer review!” This was just one of the popular chants at the weekend’s Marches for Science on Earth Day. Thousands assembled at the National Mall in Washington, with hundreds of parallel marches across the world, including South Africa. The US leg was sparked at least in part by President Donald Trump’s threats of funding cuts. Closer to home, demonstrators called more generally for support. The latter group may find they have a fair team amongst the public already. A cursory scan of recent headlines reveals an impressive list of contributions by citizen scientists. Participants in a crowdsourcing programme by Zooniverse have located some possible intriguing leads in the search for a ninth planet. A new documentary series explores the role of communities in capturing large volumes of data. A collaboration between citizen scientists and a team of professionals unearthed a new type of aurora. It relied on a large volume of photographs taken by citizens worldwide, which were compared to satellite images and analysed by professionals. South Africa is no exception to the trend. Numerous citizen science projects are advancing conservation, research and tourism projects where they otherwise would not be possible, either due to funding constraints or too few hands on deck. Examples include the management of water sources, a number of initiatives through SANBi, and the efforts of the University of Cape Town (UCT)’s Animal Demography Unit, with various virtual museums including the MammalMAP website. The South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP2) helps ornithologists conserve local species. For any researcher, fieldwork is resource-intensive and, depending on the subject, may involve safety concerns. For ecologists, this often depends on the species under scrutiny. Many species are difficult, time-consuming and dangerous to observe, and well-trained fieldworkers expensive to employ. “Ecology would be much easier if we had better ways of observing species, and images taken by amateur and professional photographers, if geo-referenced, could be a rich source of ecological information,” says Thami Nkwanyane, communications officer for the University of Cape Town (UCT). Enter UCT-based ecologist Gabriella Leighton, whose paper ‘Just Google it: assessing the use of Google Images to describe geographical variation in visible traits of organisms’* has received the most recent British Ecological Society (BES) Robert May Prize for showing how Google can help make ecology cheaper, faster and safer. Leighton spotted a gap: while using digital material to supplement fieldwork was not new, how feasible was it to replace fieldwork altogether in certain instances? And secondly, was it possible to use existing material in the public domain, rather than reaching out to citizens to collect fresh data? Leighton dryly observes: “Along with thousands of pictures of cats, people all over the world also upload photographs of wildlife to media sharing websites, stock photograph websites, blogs and everything in between. In many cases, photographers are kind enough to accompany these wildlife images with other information, such as location and date – making them really useful to ecologists.” The BES’s Chris Grieves explains, “[Leighton] compared data collected from Google Images, quick and easy, with that collected from fieldwork – time-consuming, expensive and dangerous – and showed that the data from Google images is perfectly reliable. This is an ingenious and potentially important advance: lots of data are potentially available across multiple taxa, and the possible applications in ecology and evolution are endless… Thanks to [Leighton], ecology is going to be cheaper, faster and safer in the future.” The team was able to reproduce results on colour morph distribution in matter of weeks, just by looking through photos, which took up to three years to collect in the field. Leighton analysed online image data across a range of species, from black bears in western North America to black sparrow hawks in South Africa, comparing data on their colour collected by fieldworkers with data from Google images. For Leighton’s research, two elements were particularly important: geographic locations and colour variations. The use of Google, here, was particularly useful, as it allowed for easy searching of both; Leighton was, among other things, looking at colour morphs in black bears. (As she has called them: not-so-black bears.) A further advantage, points out Leighton, is that the use of pre-existing online data can be less invasive than beginning fresh fieldwork collection. Leighton’s contribution was twofold: first, she found, through a comparative analysis of Google image data and fieldwork data, that the results were not significantly different, and that Google images could therefore, certainly in some instances, replace fieldwork. And second, her paper included the development of a web app, Morphic, which allows the approach to be widely implemented. To use Morphic, you just need to sign up, download the Google Chrome extension and create a survey form. The form is filled in for each image retrieved through Google Images, and voila. In the sense that the researchers will be using existing information, the Morphic approach does not strictly function like a typical citizen science project. Further, there can be complications. For one, picture quality can have an impact. “It very much depends on the question asked and the species of interest,” says Leighton. “If the trait of the species, for example fur colour, is visible from far away, from any angle and in an animal of any age, the success rate for finding usable images will be much higher.” Additionally, there’s a word of caution in the paper against taking colour hue for granted, because photo editing and photographic conditions can change the nuances. Thus far, copyright has not been problematic, but future users would need to be aware of acceptable use policies. “We are only using photos to extract information, for example colour and location, for research, and not using or displaying the photo itself. Therefore our use of the photos constitutes ‘fair use’,” explains Leighton. In any case, she adds, they did often end up contacting the photographer to confirm the location of the photo or other details, which they were always happy to give. The results were later sent to the photographers who were contactable. As far as possible, says Leighton, the app has been designed in order to minimise the potential risks and technical issues of using publicly available images. “We developed Morphic not only to make our study repeatable and to deal with some issues around using Google Images, but also to allow and encourage other researchers to try it out on their study systems. It is our hope that this tool will prove to be useful in answering a range of ecological questions,” she says. In short, it is an openly accessible tool that potentially means faster, cheaper and quicker ecological research that could drive more efficient conservation efforts, even in resource-strapped circumstances. The method – which was created to be easy to reproduce – is already being used to study the colour patterns of other species, including common buzzards and tawny owl morphs in Europe, Swainson’s hawks in North America and augur buzzards across East Africa. DM The paper, Just Google it: assessing the use of Google Images to describe geographical variation in visible traits of organisms by Gabriella R. M. Leighton, Pierre S.

Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google Cloud, speaks at Google Cloud Next. (Google Photo) Place your bets: Google Cloud Platform head Diane Greene told attendees at the Forbes CIO Summit last night that she thinks Google can overtake Amazon Web Services in the public cloud by 2022. According to Forbes, she’s betting on Google’s investments in artificial intelligence and its world-class infrastructure to close the gap with AWS, which has a sizable lead in the infrastructure-as-a-service market over both Google and second-place Microsoft’s Azure unit. As of earlier this year, AWS controlled 40 percent of that market, more than Microsoft, Google, and IBM combined. While a lot can happen in five years, it’s going to take a lot more than cheerleading to see Google overtake its Seattle rival in the cloud market, and Google’s AI products within Google Cloud are going to have to be substantially better than anything from its competitors — who are also investing heavily in AI and infrastructure — to entice switchers down the road. “Google is just built for having the most technology,” Greene said, according to the report. I’m not sure how well this argument plays with CIOs while out on sales calls; how can you have the “most” technology? Google’s problem in the cloud has been sales and support, not technology.

X Toggle navigation News Equipment Business Products Blogs Tech Top 250 Reviews Tech Toolbox SEARCH Subscribe Newsletters Advertise News Equipment Business Products Blogs Tech Top 250 Reviews Tech Toolbox Driver recruiting goes mobile, social and increasingly high-tech By Todd Dills “Word of mouth is the biggest thing for a driver” evaluating a company, says Steve Fields, a driver for Overland Park, Kan.-based YRC and an America’s Road Team captain. Low-tech messaging such as the driver-centric slogans on Crete Carrier’s trailers – “Our most valuable resource sits 63 feet ahead” – can be effective in spurring CB conversations on the road. But such conversations increasingly are taking place online. That’s where more direct recruiting ad dollars are going, as fleets look to broadcast their company culture through a variety of media and methodologies, from online job boards, social platforms and search engines to sophisticated online remarketing and retargeting. “I’ve been in advertising for 13 years now,” says Rob Hatchett, vice president for recruiting and communications for Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Covenant Transport. His past four in trucking have been eye-opening throughout the industry as the focus has changed. “The whole goal of anybody marketing or advertising – how to get your product in front of people’s eyeballs,” Hatchett says. “When I came to Covenant four years ago, we were spending 50 percent in digital and the other 50 percent in print media. We are now 92 percent digital and 8 percent print.” That’s a big and rapid shift that recognizes how and where drivers spend their time. “It’s easier and cheaper to get your product in front of more truck drivers,” Hatchett says. When he came to trucking, driver smartphone use wasn’t exactly an unwritten rule, but today, “it’s the norm,” he says. They “have apps, social media, they’re on Google, they’re watching YouTube videos.” Attracting experienced drivers to your fleet among stiff competition is a matter of recognizing trends, getting in front of waves of new technology and practices and allocating resources where they’ll be the most effective. Increasingly, those areas involve optimizing drivers’ online experiences on mobile devices and, perhaps most importantly, devising an effective strategy for social media as a first point of contact. In this edition of CCJ’s Tech Toolbox, we look at technologies and services that some of the nation’s largest fleets are using to find drivers that may inspire your path to do the same.

Driver recruiting goes mobile, social and increasingly high-tech Mobile-friendly branding — Learn how to be present and optimized Expanding social media — Work within today’s digital landscape Boyd Bros.: Recruiting goes social — Flatbed fleet uses Facebook to target needs Covenant Transport: Trying new things — Working the long game for long-haul teams Where available CDL holders live Maverick: Making movies — In-house video proves captivating Mobile-friendly branding — Learn how to be present and optimized By Todd Dills 81% Share of total Internet traffic generated by Randall-Reilly clients’ 2016 recruiting campaigns that came from mobile devices 75% Mobile’s share of company driver-centric Truckers News’ 2016 Internet traffic 65% Mobile’s share of owner-operator-centric Overdrive’s 2016 Internet traffic CCJ parent company Randall-Reilly has played a prominent part in driver recruiting’s digital revolution for years, serving to help facilitate the carrier-driver connection online, says Nick Reid, vice president of digital services. Among the company’s data-driven digital recruiting campaigns conducted for a variety of trucking clientele, “81 percent of the traffic generated [in Q4 2016] is now mobile,” Reid says. For company driver- and owner-operator-focused media brands, respectively, 75 percent and 65 percent of the traffic was mobile-based, with another “9 to 10 percent” in each case representing mobile tablet traffic. Technology can help generate positive word of mouth and build a fleet’s brand in many ways. Key in today’s world is being present and optimized for mobile users, Reid says. Referencing CCJ’s Top 250 list of the nation’s largest for-hire fleets, “one out of every three of the Top 250 fleets don’t have mobile-friendly websites,” he says. While many of those fleets do target recruits with custom landing pages that are mobile-friendly and designed to provide a trackable place for candidates to fill out applications and/or express interest otherwise, Reid calls a non-mobile-friendly corporate home page a big missed opportunity. A “major thing we use to measure branding success is brand search volume,” or how often the company name is searched in Google, he says. When a Google search on a company leads to “the corporate page that’s not a mobile-friendly landing page – the interaction with your brand creates a first impression that’s hard to change,” Reid says. “People are used to the immediacy of choice. If you don’t deliver, they’ll go somewhere else.” Beyond branding, decision-making around application form design always should be mobile-centric, says Priscilla Peters, vice president for marketing and training for Conversion Interactive Agency. “Focus on applications being user-friendly and quick and easy – mobile-optimized.” – FedEx Freight driver and America’s Road Team captain Don Logan, on trends toward drivers’ use of mobile devices that have accelerated quickly in recent years “If you have a long application online that’s not easily filled out from a mobile device,” it’s not going to perform as well or generate the volume and quality of leads it should, Peters says. Make it a short form or a form that auto-advances or gives users the option to autocomplete. “The mobile shift has been really big,” she says. Lane Williams, director of recruiting and retention for Alsip, Ill.-based Carrier One, speaking at Conversion’s annual Recruiting and Retention conference, spoke to the necessity of an active Facebook presence in his company’s branding and growth strategy through recruiting. The Carrier One Facebook page demonstrates an engaged sense of customer service for the all-owner-operator flatbed fleet. Williams said the company has provided a platform for its own leased drivers to answer questions that come up in comments under online posts. With their smartphones always at hand on downtime wherever they are out on the road, “a lot of them are on Facebook answering questions before I can even get on there,” he said. Driver recruiting goes mobile, social and increasingly high-tech Mobile-friendly branding — Learn how to be present and optimized Expanding social media — Work within today’s digital landscape Boyd Bros.: Recruiting goes social — Flatbed fleet uses Facebook to target needs Covenant Transport: Trying new things — Working the long game for long-haul teams Where available CDL holders live Maverick: Making movies — In-house video proves captivating Expanding social media — Work within today’s digital landscape By Todd Dills 244 Million 2016 Facebook/Instagram post impressions served by Randall-Reilly trucking media brands audience campaigns “Yesterday’s recruiting phone call is today’s social media comment,” says Priscilla Peters, vice president for marketing and training for Conversion Interactive Agency. “Their initial inquiry used to be to call the recruiting department. Now it’s to go to the company Facebook page and ask a question.” Devoting staff to monitoring Facebook comments to look for opportunities to engage can generate plenty of solid leads and leave good first impressions. Asked what tool had yielded the most recruiting success lately, Brad Vaughn, vice president of recruiting for Little Rock, Ark.-based Maverick Transportation, names the social network. “Social media has taken off way more than I thought it ever would,” says Vaughn, who recently found out firsthand what the tool has done for direct driver engagement. “Our folks that manage it were out of the office and asked me if I’d do it,” he says. “It was literally answer 10 questions, refresh and answer 10 more.” Vaughn describes generating leads this way as a matter of moving a conversation in comments under a post to a private message session, “then having a call” to continue the conversation. 44% increase in traffic to trucking media sites from social media in 2016 compared to the prior year Among smaller fleets, this kind of mobile technology-facilitated recruiting process is becoming the norm. Though Fleenor Bros. gets plenty of mileage out of 800-numbers on its dry van trailers, co-owner Kyle Cousins has had success via an expanded social media presence. The Joplin, Mo.-based fleet grew by around 33 percent between mid-2015 and mid-2016, hiring more than a dozen new drivers for its 40 mostly team-driven trucks. When Fleenor was half the size it is today, “we heavily relied on referrals,” Cousins says. “After a while, those kind of dried up.” After several high-profile custom-truck beauty show wins, Fleenor devoted time and effort to ramping up its social media efforts via a company Facebook page. “That generates a lot of traffic,” Cousins says, adding that numerous conversations have been initiated there. Drivers messaging the company via the page are encouraged to call direct for one of the few conversations that typically precede any prospect’s visit to headquarters. It’s a clear case of “strength capitalization,” says Lane Williams, director of recruiting and retention for Alsip, Ill.-based Carrier One. For his fleet with around 150 owner-operators, that means messaging that emphasizes the personal first-name-basis treatment of company contractors. 2nd Rank of social media as source of driver leads for Randall-Reilly client recruiting campaigns “We’re a small carrier,” Williams says. “That’s a good thing – if a driver calls into operations and talks to the director over there, it’s on a first-name basis – not truck number such and such. We allow an open door before they show up.” Close monitoring of and quick replies to questions on the carrier’s Facebook page is part of that strategy. From an advertising perspective, Facebook is now the second overall source of leads in Randall-Reilly recruiting campaigns, says Nick Reid, vice president of digital services. “When we talk to fleets” looking to implement social media strategies in recruiting, “some believe it’s too much work or too dangerous for their brands,” Reid says. “There’s a spectrum, but this is where you need to challenge your partners. There are so many tools and services out there that can help, with targeting and with data, to work with you for some of that heavy lifting on the social side. The benefits you get from a recruitment standpoint far outweigh” the disadvantage of not doing anything. Driver recruiting goes mobile, social and increasingly high-tech Mobile-friendly branding — Learn how to be present and optimized Expanding social media — Work within today’s digital landscape Boyd Bros.: Recruiting goes social — Flatbed fleet uses Facebook to target needs Covenant Transport: Trying new things — Working the long game for long-haul teams Where available CDL holders live Maverick: Making movies — In-house video proves captivating Boyd Bros.: Recruiting goes social — Flatbed fleet uses Facebook to target needs By Todd Dills Lori Furnell, vice president of communications for Clayton, Ala.-based Boyd Bros. Transportation, says the flatbed carrier in recent years has “really found our social-media presence [to be] totally integral to everything we do.” Either from the perspective of capturing driver leads or as “a total recruiting tool,” there’s no denying its importance, she says. Combined strategies can pay dividends CONVERSION INTERACTIVE AGENCY recently studied 10 clients’ recruiting campaigns and found that a combination of social and other online strategies performed significantly better than any one strategy alone. Clients’ ad cost per hire ranges between $400 and $1,000 or slightly more. Each client previously had been doing search engine marketing alone. Combining those efforts with a Facebook advertising campaign cut their cost per hire in half, the agency said. Through its Facebook page, Boyd communicates the company’s family image and more, with a goal toward branding and engaging drivers over questions that inevitably arrive. The company’s most-viewed video features Gail Cooper, chief executive officer and once a proud high-school cheerleader, leading a cheer for Boyd’s million-milers at an in-house banquet for the drivers. “We took an internal video and launched it out there,” Furnell says. “Then we had a lot of people asking about our company,” mostly questions about hiring area and home time. “All of that video mix can contribute to your corporate personality.” Boyd’s social media advertising strategy involves specific targeting of drivers according to company preferences and needs. “We know who we’re after, where they live, what they do and what their interests are,” Furnell says. “As much as we’re targeting them,” she’s found, drivers also certainly are “targeting their research” when thinking about where to apply. Furnell frequently asks new recruits about social platforms that they use, and the conversation inevitably turns to how they use the platforms to conduct their own research. One thing she’s heard repeatedly from drivers about such research: “The first thing I did was go to their Facebook page.” Online job boards remain part of the marketing effort, where Boyd can conduct more targeted marketing and do “better at finding an exact fit.” The company uses Tenstreet’s applicant tracking system to follow up on responses to leads and allow recruiters to know exactly what sorts of communications have been made with any individual recruit. “We can create a variety of emails and texts and all kinds of things to ensure” the conversation continues with any lead that hasn’t followed through to formal application, Furnell says.

I like to be the third person to the party.” With most recruiting campaigns now conducted digitally, proving efficacy is easier than ever. “Sometimes you have to try stuff,” Hatchett says. His department sets aside a certain amount of dollars a month to experiment with new tools and strategies “to see what’s going to work.” “I spend a bunch of money with ad partners sending me leads, then I take my applications over the past 12 months and constantly work the whole database. Rob Hatchett, vice president of recruiting and communications for Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Covenant Transport In analyzing your digital spend, he says to always “make sure you are portraying the right message” through whatever avenue you’re using to market to drivers. For Covenant, which employs team drivers for long-haul freight, “I want to make sure that if someone is calling, they already know they have to come in a team. In digital, you’re paying per click or paying per application – why do you want someone to click on you and have no desire to do what you do?” Hatchett’s department recruits for two affiliated fleets in addition to the Covenant teams – Southern Refrigerated Transport and Star Transportation (regional dedicated dry van). He’s seeing the most success working through the company’s in-house prospect database. “I spend a bunch of money with ad partners sending me leads, then I take my applications over the past 12 months and constantly work the whole database,” Hatchett says. That’s accomplished through a series of “basic email campaigns and through remarketing and retargeting,” he says.

The sites offer trucking employers access to driver leads to initiate conversations about potential employment. “We get around 11,000 applications a month,” says Chip Aldridge, Randall-Reilly Digital Services director. Many come from initial points of contact through job searches, Google-served ads, Facebook and ad aggregators such as Indeed.com. Trucking companies then purchase leads based on geographic need or by lane. Customers include many of the largest truckload fleets but also smaller carriers with targeted needs. “We have about 200 clients per month purchasing this type of service,” says Aldridge. “Half of the 200 clients are 150 trucks or less. I’d say 10 percent are in the 50-truck range.” Deep South states are perennially among those most densely populated by CDL holders treading the waters for employment. Mississippi ranked the highest in 2015, but Wyoming further afield was not far behind. Vermont and Massachusetts showed the lowest per-capita density of applicants. Driver recruiting goes mobile, social and increasingly high-tech Mobile-friendly branding — Learn how to be present and optimized Expanding social media — Work within today’s digital landscape Boyd Bros.: Recruiting goes social — Flatbed fleet uses Facebook to target needs Covenant Transport: Trying new things — Working the long game for long-haul teams Where available CDL holders live Maverick: Making movies — In-house video proves captivating Maverick: Making movies — In-house video proves captivating By Todd Dills Brad Vaughn, vice president of recruiting for Little Rock, Ark.-based Maverick Transportation, has seen a lot of change in his 15 years with the flatbed fleet, following work as a recruiter for the Natural State’s IT professionals. “When I started, you had to be in the magazines, have an ad in the digests and do a lot of newspapers,” Vaughn says. “My first or second year, we started trying online applications. It’s interesting to see how that’s changed. I can remember sitting in meetings where people would say, ‘If you pull out of the magazines, everybody’s going to notice.’ We didn’t do a magazine ad in 2016.” The screenshot in the player shows a recent high-quality video that features brief interviews with drivers in Maverick Transportation’s reefer division. Everything is happening digitally, from ad buys to applications. What Vaughn believes now is gaining Maverick the most attention from potential recruits are YouTube videos combined with the company’s Facebook social platform. A couple of dozen videos are available via the MaverickTransLLC YouTube channel and the company’s website. “They’re a huge tool for us,” he says. Maverick hired its own in-house videographer after realizing that working with an agency was “jaw-droppingly expensive,” Vaughn says. “After we priced three or four, we sat down and made a laundry list of all of the videos we could do. We lucked out and found somebody from an agency here locally who is super-talented.” Vaughn also lauds the video blogs of three or four of Maverick’s drivers who publish almost daily, noting that driver Dale Clay’s YouTube channel is followed by thousands of viewers. “We get a decent amount of hires from our drivers, but we haven’t hosted driver videos directly yet,” he says. For years, we’ve always said we’re a family company and that we treat people like they’re family members. Every company says that, but how else can you do that? You’ve got to prove that to them. Get them on the phone, and then do what you say you’re going to do. It boils down to the golden rule. Brad Vaughn, vice president of recruiting for Little Rock, Ark.-based Maverick Transportation The company also uses geotargeting in particular regions through a variety of means and data services. “When I first started and we had a dedicated job opening in this little town in this rural area of the country, we might try to run a newspaper ad or do local radio,” Vaughn says. “Often, I would end up sending somebody or go myself and set up in a hotel room or banquet hall to recruit. Now, with these tools to identify and market to specific people, it’s all changed the way I do business.” The ability of recruiting service providers to track data and verify the effectiveness of their strategies has greatly improved Maverick’s own in-house efforts, allowing for more effective use of marketing and advertising dollars, Vaughn says. “We’re able to see pretty early on” whether something is working or not, he says. “If it’s not producing, let’s reallocate these dollars somewhere else.” For applicant tracking, Maverick’s targets on leads “stay live with us for a long time,” Vaughn says. An applicant tracking system database from EBE Technologies enables the fleet to follow the touch points a driver has had with the company, including “text blasts, robocalls, mailers, advertising,” he says. There’s also still a lot of traditional recruiting that plays a role. “I don’t think that the bedrock things that attract people to the company have changed,” Vaughn says. “For years, we’ve always said we’re a family company and that we treat people like they’re family members. Every company says that, but how else can you do that? You’ve got to prove that to them. Get them on the phone, and then do what you say you’re going to do. It boils down to the golden rule.” The rise of video in recruitment marketing, internet consumption While Maverick Transportation’s videos have a slick professional quality, for those with lesser expertise or lacking the resources to hire talent to produce videos, there’s nothing stopping you from using moving pictures to your recruiting advantage. The march of technology has delivered on bursting barriers to entry, with high-definition cameras in all manner of mobile devices, GoPro cameras and webcams delivering views around the world directly from the truck driver’s point of view. What newer social platforms such as Snapchat have in common is one thing, says Oliver Feakins of AllTruckJobs.com: “Video.” Speaking at Conversion Interactive Agency’s Recruiting and Retention conference, Feakins said the proliferation of online video also is changing the expectations of those who consume the medium – including truck drivers thinking about working for your fleet. Worrying too much about high production values and image sanitization increasingly will backfire. “Ten years ago, it was all about production values,” he said. “Now it’s about authenticity. The next generation of would-be truck drivers is learning how to consume their social media in a video channel.” Feakins referenced the Youtube work of driver Allie Knight, who with a GoPro on the truck, among other explanatory videos and more, has garnered 68,000 followers and more than 20 million video views. “Her cost of admission into this was a $300 camera,” Feakins said. Analysis of online advertisements that contained video versus those that didn’t showed that cost per lead was considerably less for video ads ($6 per lead) versus static banners ($9). “Early adopters win, period,” Feakins said.

Google Fit v1.64 for Wear 2.0 can now identify strength training exercises and automatically count reps [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/24 8:19am PDTApr 24, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares125 Android Wear Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Automatically track strength exercises 1.2 Unit Settings 2 Download Google Fit stands as one of Google's only flagship apps on Android Wear, and may be the only one of its apps that matters more on a watch than it does on a phone. There's a new version of the app available on the Play Store for both watches and phones, but this update is all about adding a big feature for Wear. There's a new mode for recording strength training and similar activities that involve counting reps. This update is for Wear 2.0 only, so quite a few people will have to wait until the rollout is complete before testing this out, but it works on the last developer preview as well as any watch that already has the official 2.0 firmware. What's New Official Changelog: Automatically track your strength training exercises on your Android Wear smartwatch. Minor improvements. Bug fixes. Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Settings for units of measure Automatically track strength exercises Did you pick up a Wear device with the intention of recording workouts, then found that there wasn't much you could get out of the box? Sure, you could look to other apps, but if you wanted to use Google Fit, it only supported a few specific activities like walking and running, bicycling, and push-ups; but this did nothing for the wide range of exercises that you can and should do to get in shape. The new version of Google Fit expands the tracking capabilities significantly with a new Strength Training tool that greatly increases the range of activities that can be measured. To launch the Strength Training tracker, either open the "Fit Workout" item from the app launcher on Wear or open the Fit app and tap on the pink button to begin an activity, then look through the list for Strength Training. Once your session is recording, Google Fit will analyze motion of the watch to determine what you're doing and how many reps you've completed. When your set is complete, tap the button at the bottom and Fit will present your rep count. If you're keeping track of the count in your head and the numbers don't match up, you can adjust the count by sliding the top number to the left or right. If you're using weights, you should also slide the second number to the left to record the actual weight. Then scroll down a bit to the buttons titled Save, Delete, or Save and Exit. Saving the set will open up a follow-up screen with a countdown for resting before beginning the next set. In my very brief test, Fit successfully guessed I was doing bicep curls. I'm not sure about the rep count on that one, I was busy fiddling with screenshots. On my second test, I happened to switch arms and change the orientation of the watch, and this may have been enough to fool Fit into thinking I had taken to doing sit-ups. If this happens, you can tap the name of the exercise at the top to set the correct activity. For what it's worth, the rep count was correct. Overall, this is a pretty big addition and makes Wear considerably more useful for fitness tracking, especially in the gym. The workflow might still be a little cumbersome if each new set is supposed to happen immediately after the last, but this is still fine for most traditional workouts. Note: This feature was technically available on the stock firmware for the LG Watch Sport and possibly Style when they were fresh out of the box, but it seemed to disappear with either a server-side switch or an update to the Fit app. With this update, it's back for those watches and now available for all other watches on Wear 2.0. Unit Settings There is one other change worth noting, although it probably go mostly ignored. If you find that the units of measurement aren't to your liking, they can now be changed right on the watch. Just open Google Fit, scroll to the bottom to find the button to open Settings, then tap on the Units button. You can make changes for Height, Weight, Distance, and Energy. Most people probably won't need this, but it's a little more important now that Wear is intended to operate with less reliance on a paired phone. It makes sense if some users don't set up the app on a phone before using it on a watch for the first time. There's no harm in having it there.

Most AW watches I see are pretty nice. Too nice to want to wear as I work out in a gym with free weights. Wouldn't this make more sense with a partnering fitness tracker that you could wear with or without a nice watch? Morten Ulv I work out with a Urbane 2nd ed. Don't really understand what the issues would be? Doug McHone Isn't that watch a nicer piece of wear than what you would typically have on while working up a sweat? It just seems out of place for that application to me. I would rather AW make a fitness tracker similar to a fitbit for swimming and rigorous exercising. Morten Ulv I guess I just don't mind. I guess it could be nice with a fitness tracker companion, but then you might as well just use some existing one? Fitbit doesn't natively sync with Google Fit though, but there are workarounds. I use the watch for music as well (and calls since the Fitness Center watch my kids while I work out and call me if something is up), and then a fitness tracker wouldn't work. John Doe What happened to all the health tracking stuff? http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/01/25/google-play-services-v10-2-prepares-for-google-fit-v2-api-and-fido-certified-security-keys-apk-teardown/ Cody Toombs What do you mean? It hasn't launched yet. John Doe I thought it would launch with Android Wear 2.0. You know, Google Fit v2.0 and Android Wear 2.0? "Rumors have circulated for a while that Fit v2.0 will launch alongside Android Wear 2.0 next month." Cody Toombs Yeah, it definitely would have made sense, but it seems like they're still holding this back. Given that it didn't happen with Wear 2.0, and we're already staring down the barrel of I/O, the odds are pretty good that it will be announced (and probably released) next month. John Doe Google is really fucking things up with Android wear. It would be very embarrassing if I/O is here and all Android wear watches that were promised to be updated are not updated by that time. surethom Still not heart rate monitor Liam Alexander Colman This is also available on my Moto 360 Sport which hasn't been updated yet. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/76b7df372790b088b874c4e00d18392755bba1454b663e00ea922c85b82e6af3.jpg Antti Elonheimo I was about to comment the same. Haven't​ yet tested it out though. Liam Alexander Colman I have done some push ups and it worked ;) Antti Elonheimo Did it record heart rate data for you? I tested it also and it didn't. During rest it showed heart rate with something like "HR: --" under the timer. Don't know if something is wrong or not. It doesn't even show that in the screenshots in AP article. Liam Alexander Colman Yep same with the HR for me. Counts the reps though perfectly! Chewieez Same here. I used it today on my moto 360 sport. It automatically recognized jumping jacks and push ups and squats. It missed side lunges, but it was easy to input the workout. HR didn't seem to be recorded. surethom Google fit wear app is good but it's missing regular heart rate monitoring & sleep tracking F4LL0U7 Agreed, if they could keep the heart rate monitor active during your workouts, it would be great. F4LL0U7 They'd also need to let us do something with that information. When I manually measure my heartrate, that info seems to just disappear. Vadim Shun I cannot imagine it being able to detect pull-ups, chin-ups and headstand push- ups which are staple of my routine in a gym since hands in these exercises are largely stationary in these positions. Also still cannot take watch for activities such as whitewater kayaking so, while helpful for some, the app will still be disabled for me to save on battery. Morten Ulv I just tested chin-ups and it detected it perfectly. No clue how it does it though. Too weak to do headstand push-ups though, sorry! ;) Morten Ulv Detected push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, bicep curls without fault. Bench press was detected as Overhead press, but I just faked it on a sofa, so that might have caused it. Was easy to change it manually though (came up as first alternative). Maximilian Keppeler As a developer of a Push-Ups app, is there an API for identifying exercises? (Push-Ups) Taa Ynwa You don't need AW 2.0 for this. This works perfectly fine on my LG Watch Urbane 2 running AW 1.5 and Google Fit 1.64. Jaime Lopez If you start Sports Gear Tracker on watch and start Fit strength training workout on watch, fit will show average heart rate on fit strength training workout summary. So , both are running at same time. If you teach fit what movement you did after it tries to guess (i.e.) hand stand push up, it will learn the movement. My watch also shows"HR--" so keep hoping it is coming. I have LG Urbane and use Barton quick change bands to make it more workout suitable.

I don't mean to imply this annual tradition has no value, but do you remember what won last year? Hey, maybe this one will be different. Google seems to be making a bigger deal of it. There are 12 total categories including best game, best app, best social impact, best app for kids, and so on. Each one has five finalists, which will be whittled down to one at I/O—specifically on Thursday, May 18th at 6:30pm. The nomination and award process is handled internally at Google, so it's all very vague. The blog post says the selection relies upon "high star rating, technical performance, and freshness." Some of the finalists are befuddling, like Lineage 2 Attack (Revolution) in the games category—it really doesn't look like a game. The indie game category has some very good titles, though. You can see the full list of nominees and categories on the Play Store. Source: Google Tags apps Games Google google play google play awards video subscribe ...

Lee Apr 24, 2017, 5:10pm EDT Presented By tweet share Where technology and economics collide Flying cars have long been a staple of science fiction, but until recently the technology to build small, versatile flying vehicles hasn’t really existed. But that may be about to change. John Markoff of the New York Times has given the world its first look at a single-person flying vehicle created by Kitty Hawk, a startup funded by Google billionaire Larry Page. It looks a bit like a scaled-up version of the quadcopter drones a lot of people got under their Christmas trees in recent years. It has pontoons on the bottom, and the idea seems to be that people will use it like a high-tech jet ski, zooming 10 or 20 feet above the water. Depending on its price and capabilities, the Kitty Hawk Flyer could become a hit in the personal watercraft market. But the broader category of small, battery-powered flying vehicles could have a much bigger impact. According to Bloomberg, Kitty Hawk has a division called Zee Aero that is working on larger flying vehicles that could be used for rapid commuting within an urban area. Other companies are working on similar technologies. “There’s a couple of technologies that are maturing and converging” to make small, affordable airplanes feasible, said Brian German, an aerospace researcher at Georgia Tech, in a December interview. German argues that lighter and more powerful electric motors, batteries that can store more energy, and more sophisticated aviation software could transform the market for small aircraft. Those breakthroughs could make possible the kind of Star Wars–style landspeeder Kitty Hawk unveiled this week. They are behind the small package-delivery drones already being developed by Amazon, Google’s X moonshot lab, and a number of startups. And before long, they could also make it possible for people to commute to work in small flying vehicles. Silicon Valley innovations are spilling over into aviation A conventional airplane takes off horizontally, building up enough speed for the wings to carry it skyward. That means a normal airplane needs a long runway to take off and land. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft, by contrast, take off vertically like a helicopter, then switch to flying horizontally once they’re in the air. That allows them to take off and land in locations where conventional airplanes can’t. VTOL airplanes are not a new technology — craft like the Harrier and the V-22 Osprey have been around since the 1960s. But these airplanes have never been very practical. They’re complex and expensive, and require pilots with specialized training to fly them. But a shift from internal combustion engines to electric motors dramatically changes this equation. Electric motors can be much lighter, simpler, and cheaper than traditional aircraft engines powered by fossil fuels — and they’re getting lighter and more powerful every year. And that opens up a lot of new opportunities for airplane designers. To see what the small, electric-powered aircraft of the future might look like, check out this image from a patent filing by Page’s Zee Aero. It shows a tiny personal airplane not much wider than a conventional parking space (you can get a sense of scale from this photograph of a man standing next to a prototype): Zee Aero It takes a lot more thrust for an aircraft to take off vertically than it does to keep the aircraft moving once it’s in the air. So Zee Aero’s design has eight vertical propellers that are used for takeoff, while there are just two in the back to provide horizontal thrust. Once the plane is soaring through the sky, the eight vertical propellers can be turned off to save power. This kind of design wouldn’t work with conventional aircraft engines because 10 engines would be way too heavy. But electric motors can be made extremely small and light, allowing even a car-size vehicle to have 10 of them. Of course, electric motors aren’t a new invention. But they’ve gradually gotten lighter and more powerful over time. Beyond that, it has taken rapid progress in two other areas to make VTOL vehicles practical: batteries and aviation software. The big advantage of traditional airplane fuel is that it can pack a lot of energy into a small package, minimizing the amount of weight airplanes have to carry and allowing them to travel long distances without refueling. “Right now, batteries that you could actually put in an airplane wouldn’t let you fly very far,” German told me. “But you give it a few more years, and the writing’s on the wall that you will be able to make a very practical aircraft.” Improvements in battery technology are a spillover benefit of innovations elsewhere in Silicon Valley. The burgeoning markets for laptops, smartphones, tablets, and electric cars have inspired companies to pour billions of dollars into better battery technology. As a result, the energy density of batteries has been improving steadily. And each time batteries improve, electric airplanes can be a little lighter and fly a little farther on a single charge. German said battery technology isn’t quite there yet. He predicted the energy density of batteries will need to approximately double for small electric airplanes to really take off. Batteries don’t improve as rapidly as computer chips, so it’s hard to say exactly how quickly batteries will improve. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is currently building a giant battery factory, has said that battery density typically improves by 5 to 8 percent per year, which implies that density could double in the next decade — though that could require finding new battery chemistries. The other key breakthrough is better software. An airplane with 10 propellers is just too complex for a human pilot to manage effectively. But computer software can easily manage 10 propellers at once, supplying power to the propellers where the most thrust is needed. And German told me that multi-propeller designs have significant safety advantages. “If you lose one, you still have some left,” he says. “You can design a lot of redundancy.” The combination of smaller, more powerful electric motors, better batteries, and sophisticated software will open up dramatically new possibilities for aircraft design. I focused on Zee Aero’s 10-propeller design above, but there are lots of other prototypes under development. The Volocopter looks a lot like a giant quadcopter drone — except that it has 18 propellers instead of the four you’ll find on a normal quadcopter. Joby Aviation is working a two-seat airplane design that has 12 propellers for takeoff — four on the wings and four on the tail — that fold up once the aircraft is airborne, switching to four additional propellers optimized for horizontal flight: Joby Aviation And of course, this is still a young field. If this technology does become mainstream, the successful design might look very different from these early prototypes. Tiny electric airplanes could transform air travel On its own, swapping conventional aircraft engines for electric motors could have significant benefits, reducing the cost of air travel and emissions per flight. But the bigger opportunity here is to make air travel practical in situations where no one would think to take an airplane today. Back in October, Uber published a white paper describing its vision of the future that small VTOL aircraft could make possible. Uber envisions a network of on-demand aircraft carrying passengers among many landing spots distributed throughout a metropolitan area. For example, right now it takes at least an hour to drive from San Jose, California, to San Francisco — and closer to two hours during rush hour. In contrast, Uber estimates, the same trip could take 15 minutes in a VTOL airplane. Uber estimates that the trip would initially cost around $129, which would fall to $43 within a few years and could eventually go as low as $20. That compares favorably to the more than $100 it would cost to take a cab over the same route. And because these aircraft can take off and land vertically, they wouldn’t require full-blown airports at each end. Vehicles could take off and land in small “vertiports” that could fit in a suburban parking lot or the top floor of an urban parking garage. And naturally, Uber envisions an on-demand model where users book a flight with their smartphones minutes before arriving at a vertiport. At first, VTOL aircraft are likely to have human pilots who steer the vehicles. Sophisticated software could control many routine aspects of the flight, allowing people to become pilots with less training than they require today. In the long run, it will likely be possible to dispense with pilots altogether and have the aircraft fly themselves. This will not only save the cost of the pilot’s salary but also reduce the vehicle’s weight and thereby further improve efficiency and lower costs. That could lead to significant changes in traffic patterns. It could accelerate suburban sprawl, as affluent people buy land far from downtown and commute to work by air. Affordable short-range air travel could make it easier for city dwellers to take day and weekend trips to towns in the surrounding countryside. In the long run, concerns about congestion and noise could create a bottleneck for widespread use of the technology. VTOL aircraft are likely to be significantly less noisy than a helicopter, but it would still be annoying to live next door to a vertiport with hundreds of flights taking off every hour. And even if the cost of operating a flying car gets cheap enough that middle-class people can afford it, there might simply not be enough space in the skies directly overhead major metropolitan areas to accommodate more than a fraction of the demand. Obviously, we’re still several years away — at least — from commercial, on-demand flying car service. But we’re also well beyond the point of idle speculation. A number of startups have built working prototypes, and big companies like Uber have begun to study this market and consider how they might participate in it. So sometime in the next decade or two, expect to start seeing small, funny-looking airplanes buzzing around in the sky overhead. Was this article helpful?

For free! Except, not quite; as it turns out, you end up paying in privacy. That’s just one revelation from a bombshell New York Times look at Uber, which showed how Unroll.me, the service described above, scans the email accounts of its users for information as granular as Lyft receipts to anonymize, package, and sell on the lucrative data market. Unroll.me CEO Jojo Hedaya issued something like an apology, though he mostly seemed sorry that no one bothered to read the terms of service closely enough. Private Parts Brian Barrett You Should Go Check Facebook’s New Privacy Settings Kevin Mitnick Famed Hacker Kevin Mitnick Shows You How to Go Invisible Online Andy Baio Wired Opinion: The Perpetual, Invisible Window Into Your Gmail Inbox But while Unroll.me has taken plenty of well-deserved flack for the unexpected disclosure, it’s hardly the only service that taps into your Gmail, or your other Google services, or for that matter your Facebook account. You’re probably given that access away freely, without even realizing it—or the full scope of its implications—in exchange for a little added convenience, whether that’s getting Bed Bath & Beyond’s digital marketers off your back, or simply using your Google account to sign in to a range of apps and sites across the internet. Not all of these interactions and permissions are grody, or even all that objectionable. Your Withings App wants to tap into Google Fit? Sure, makes sense. Your email client needs Gmail access? Of course! Otherwise it would be a nothing client. Often, though the adage holds true: If it’s free, you’re the product. Or more specifically, your browsing habits and social graph are, both of which advertisers crave. That makes now as good a time as any to audit who’s tapping into your Google and Facebook services, and for what reason. You may have other go-to services you want to check as well, but these two are both the biggest, and the most commonly used for OAuth, an open standard that lets you use those accounts as your sign-in across the web. Fortunately, taking stock takes no time at all. Neither does clearing out unwelcome interactions. Here’s how. Google To see what apps and services you’ve given Google permissions to, just head here. That’s where you’ll find Unroll.me, for instance, along with anywhere else that has asked for your info. You might be surprised by what you find! (A personal example: At some point, I apparently agreed to let Target know my email address, approximate age, prefered language, and basic account details. Whoops?) Not every connected entity has the same level of privileges. To see what they can tap into, just click, and the view will expand for a helpfully detailed rundown. You can’t adjust the level of access from here, but if you want to cut something out of your Google goodies altogether, just click Remove, and then OK when a pop-up asks you if you’re absolutely sure. Confusingly, Google also lets you parse your Connected Accounts here. These are accounts you voluntarily linked to your Google account, like say if in a fit of optimism you linked your Google Plus and your Twitter so that all your Google Plus friends could read your tweets. There’s not likely to be much in there, but check it just in case. Facebook The Facebook case isn’t quite the same as Google. But Facebook also integrates with all kinds of third-parties, and if you’re auditing one you might as well take a look at the other. Especially given that, if anything, it’s even easier to purge. If you want to nuke any app, website, or plugin interactions with Facebook, just go to Settings, click Apps, then hit Edit under Apps, Websites and Plugins, and click Disable Platform. For a more targeted strike, look at the top of that same Settings page and see what you’ve linked up with. Go ahead and ditch any you don’t use anymore, or don’t need Facebook to tap into. Also to be clear, And while you’re at it, go to Apps Others Use, and click Edit, and clear out all of those categories, so that your info doesn’t get spread around just because your friends are still playing FarmVille for some reason. There’s a whole other world of Facebook privacy settings to explore, but in terms integrating your account with other services, this should about cover you. Again, not all use cases are bad! It makes sense for your Fitbit to tap into your health data. And OAuth can be a genuine convenience that doesn’t necessarily mean that those companies use your data inappropriately. (WIRED, for instance, lets you log in with your Facebook account.) There are plenty of permissions you’ll want to keep in place. Besides which, none of this stops Google and Facebook from using your info for highly targeted ads. But at least this way you’ll know who’s got their hooks into your accounts, and why. And, more importantly, you can kick them out. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Apps google privacy security Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News. Share Share Tweet Comment Email Skip Social.

Michael Pascoe comments. More videos Amazon by the numbers Get to know the online retail giant before it sets up shop on Australian shores. Amazon has previously sold subscriptions such as these, but this is first time it has packaged them in one place for customers to browse and purchase. If what Amazon is doing sounds a lot like Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store for Android phones, you are correct. For now, Amazon's new digital subscription storefront is a pipsqueak. Amazon announces new products or services all the time that don't go anywhere. But the potential is intriguing. Related Content The three-second rule for online shopping Amazon ponders robot-run supermarket with three human staff The app stores from Apple and Google are hugely powerful gatekeepers for sales of online music, newspapers and magazines, digital video packages, food delivery subscriptions and software. If you're a company that offers a digital service -- particularly ones like Spotify or newspapers that are commonly accessed on smartphones -- Apple and Google call the shots that influence your business and stand between your success and failure. Amazon is giving companies an alternative to distributing their digital subscriptions without relying on the storefronts controlled by Apple and Google. Advertisement The new service is part of a trend at Amazon that isn't broadly understood. Of course everyone knows Amazon is the supreme gatekeeper for products. If your shoes or headphones aren't sold on Amazon, they don't exist in the minds of many shoppers. More quietly, Amazon has also become an influential storefront for non-physical things, too, like software subscriptions and online TV services. And indeed, the new digital subscription storefront mimics one Amazon started in 2015 for online video subscription services like Starz and Seeso, a comedy-focused Web video service. Entertainment companies were initially skeptical about Amazon's motives but changed their minds. For some digital video channels, Amazon quickly became the single largest seller of their subscriptions, according to a report last fall in tech news outlet The Information. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Amazon announces new products or services all the time that don't go anywhere. But the potential is intriguing. Photo: AP For companies that aren't well known -- and even ones that are -- selling subscriptions is a grind. They have to splurge on ads to get noticed, try free marketing tricks or hope that Google or Apple decide to feature them in the highly visible home pages of their app stores. Subscription services can easily get lost in the cacophony of Amazon, too, but the company can also suggest that customers who buy a book of New Yorker cartoons also purchase a digital subscription to the magazine. Amazon is good at selling subscriptions to its own Prime shopping club, which analysts estimate has 60 million to 70 million members, and it could bring that expertise to bear to sell outsiders' subscriptions, too. The real intrigue is whether Amazon would change the rules of the distribution game if it can join Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google as the gatekeepers for all sorts of digital goods. For companies that opt to sell digital subscriptions through Amazon, it is offering similar revenue sharing as Apple's recently revised business terms for companies that sell digital services. For a customer's first year as a subscriber, the owners of a digital subscription keeps 70 percent of the revenue and gives 30 percent to Amazon. After the first year, the company's cut goes up to 85 cents of every dollar from the subscription fee. But what if Amazon decided to take an even smaller share of revenue from subscriptions, or none at all? Presumably that would put pressure on Apple and Google to follow suit. Companies have complained for years that they are giving away too much money to the owners of mobile app stores and would welcome an upstart who lets them keep a bigger slice of the pie. Spotify has gone so far as to recommend people pay for the music service away from Apple's App Store. For people who don't, the price of a Spotify subscription is 30 per cent higher to offset the revenue it has to share with Apple. For companies that rely on powerful gatekeepers like Google and Apple for their livelihood, an Amazon alternative for selling subscriptions could be a breath of fresh air.

The YI Halo, a new virtual reality camera that runs on Google’s Jump VR platform. Made by Chinese camera company YI with Google, the Halo shoots 4k video simultaneously on all 17 cameras. It uses Google’s Jump software to stitch the footage together into a single, immersive 360-degree VR film. Google announced the new hardware Monday, barely a week after Facebook revealed plans for a pair of its own VR cameras: the x24 and x6. “Cameras are hot. That’s good. We planned this a while ago,” Amit Singh, Google’s VP of business for VR, said at a briefing with reporters in San Francisco ahead of the news release. The YI Halo will go on sale this summer, and Google says some early partners will get rigs right away. Why are consumer tech companies competing to make expensive hardware for a niche professional market? They really just want to sell more virtual reality headsets. But first, they need content people can actually watch on their futuristic face-mounted TVs. The tech industry has spent the past year pushing virtual reality goggles like Facebook’s Oculus Rift, the Samsung Gear VR and the Sony PlayStation VR. Google has two of its own lower-cost products, the Cardboard and the Google Daydream View. But virtual reality experiences are in short supply, in part because of how much time and money it takes to produce quality VR movies. Like most VR camera rigs, the YI Halo is a bunch of action cameras cobbled together into a ring with a single camera on top. It looks like an old-school slide carousel and weight about eight pounds. Though it has dabbled in other hardware, including phones and routers, Google partnered with a camera company on the Halo instead of making its own. Google is instead focused on the underlying technology, like algorithms that can stitch footage together with minimal mistakes in hours instead of months. One early YI Halo tester is virtual reality filmmaker Armando Kirwin of Milk VR, who said at the press briefing that Facebook’s cameras aren’t really direct competition. Instead, the Halo is aimed at lengthy multi-million dollar productions that use expensive special effects artists to put together the footage. As YouTube-owner Google knows well, there can be an advantage to volume over quality when it comes to content. To get more people shooting, Google is launching a program called Jump Start. Filmmakers can apply for free cameras and use of the Jump software. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the price of Google’s VR camera.

Right now, Galaxy smartphone and tablet users are focused on the Android 7.0 Nougat update and the problems its causing. And for good reason. The Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat update is starting to make significant progress in the United States and other countries around the world. While your focus is and probably should be on Android Nougat, there’s another piece of Android software lurking above ground. That update is Android O, the unnamed successor to Google’s Android Nougat (formerly known as Android N) update. The Android O update is confirmed and it’s available in beta form for Pixel devices and select Nexus devices. We expect Google to outline the next batch of details as Google I/O, its annual developer event, in May. Android Nougat is in focus right now but Android O and its release will slowly but surely creep into the heads of many Galaxy users around the world. Maybe it’s already in yours. Today we want to help you set some realistic expectations regarding the Samsung Galaxy Android O update and its release. These expectations aren’t aimed at power users. Instead, we want to help set proper expectations for new, and average, Samsung Galaxy smartphone and tablet owners. We also want to inform prospective Galaxy smartphone and tablet buyers. Nothing is confirmed but here are a few things we expect from Samsung’s Android O release based on its Android Nougat release for Galaxy devices around the world. Samsung Android O Beta Pixel and Nexus users have access to the Android O update right now, well ahead of its official release date later this year. Samsung Galaxy users can expect something similar down the road. Last year, Samsung launched a Galaxy S7 Nougat beta that allowed owners in select regions with select versions of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge try out the software ahead of time. Samsung also ran an Android Marshmallow beta on the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy Note 5 back in 2015. These betas confirmed features and tweaks and they also provided Samsung with valuable feedback about bugs and other problems. It’ll probably be awhile before the company confirms its plans but we fully expect Samsung to launch an Android O beta for its flagship devices, a list that currently includes the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The company is rumored to be working on a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 for release later this year and we’d expect it to make the cut as well. Samsung probably would’ve released a Nougat beta for the Galaxy Note 7, had it not started to blow up. If you want to be among the first people to try out Samsung’s next major operating system upgrade, you’ll want to think about picking up one of Samsung’s higher-end devices. Flagships Will Get Android O First Unlike Apple and Google, there’s a pecking order when it comes to Samsung Android software releases. Apple’s iOS updates go out to all compatible devices at the same time. Google’s Android updates typically do too. Samsung’s roll out process takes a lot longer and its often a painfully long wait for those with non-flagship smartphones and tablets. Samsung’s Android 7.0 Nougat update is starting to move a little faster but its been a long, drawn out process. The first updates started rolling out to the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge in January (Google first released Nougat back in August) and we’re finally starting to see other popular devices like the Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, and Galaxy Tab S2 get their bump to Android Nougat. The company’s got a long way to go though. Many Galaxy smartphones and tablets haven’t received Android Nougat and many users will be waiting into the second half of the year for the upgrade. It’s impossible to predict how the Android O release will go but if we use Nougat as an indicator, most of you will probably get the Android O update in 2018. If you want new software as soon as possible, you’ll probably want to invest in a device like the Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S8 and not a mid-range phone like the Galaxy J3. Devices Will Probably Get Cut If you own a Galaxy smartphone or tablet that’s two years old or older start bracing for a life without Android O. Samsung and its carrier partners typically keeps Galaxy devices updated for two years before discontinuing support for major software upgrades. Popular devices like the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 are still getting security updates and bug fixes but neither device is expected to get Nougat. Unless Samsung surprises (and it might), Android Nougat could be the end of line for popular phones like the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. Slow Updates for Unlocked Models The Samsung Galaxy S7 Android Nougat update started rolling out in January. And while it’s hit many devices, the U.S. Cellular models included, Android 7.0 still hasn’t rolled out to the unlocked models in the United States and other countries around the world. It’s unclear if this treatment will extend to the unlocked Galaxy S8 and the Android O release but it’s something you’ll want to certainly keep in mind if you already own an unlocked model or if you’re thinking about buying one in the future. Missing Features Those are a few things we think you can expect from Samsung’s Android O release. Now we want to talk about something you can expect from the Samsung Android O update. The Android O update is currently in beta which means a lot can (and probably will) change between now and Google’s official release later this year. It’s difficult to predict what features and changes Samsung might keep and what be different in its version of Android O. What we can say though is that you can expect Samsung’s Android O updates to be different from one another with older devices getting the short-end of the stick. Much like Apple’s iOS updates, newer devices tend to get more robust software. Take the Galaxy Android Nougat update for example. Samsung held back the Galaxy S7’s Always On Display feature from the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. It also declined to offer Nougat’s Video enhancer feature. We expect the Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, and Galaxy Note 8 (if there is one) to get the best versions of Android O. Of course, there will likely be ways to get Android O’s best features on older devices but not everyone wants to deal with going through a bunch of hoops to get them on board. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 7 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 296 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares514 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%.

Going forward, Google will automatically translate local reviews into your native language. So if you’re in a foreign country and looking for a place to eat, for example, the reviews you find will be in displayed in whichever language you have set on your device. Google says this will occur automatically when conducting a search in the Google Maps or Search app. It doesn’t sound like this is a change that will roll out across mobile browser search or desktop search. When reading reviews, the translated version will appear first followed by the original version. Here is an example: To start seeing translated reviews as pictured above, make sure your Google Maps and Search apps are updated to the latest versions.

According to TechCrunch, the search engine giant is pitching this as a way of managing TV and online ad campaigns from the same place. Here is what Rany NG Director, Product Management; Google had to say in a blog post: “Historically, TV and digital advertising have been bought and measured through different systems and currencies,” Google writes. “By adding traditional TV buying into DoubleClick Bid Manager, we are taking the first step towards allowing advertisers and agencies to manage their video campaigns across digital and linear TV, in a more efficient and effective way.” Google will be able to achieve this by integrating DoubleClick with other TV ad companies and products, including Wideorbit, Clypd and Google Fiber. Advertisers, according to Google, will then have access to both national and local ad inventory. Four years ago, Google and Facebook agreed upon an amicable partnership despite bitter rivalry existing between the two online giants. Google at the time worked with the leading social networking company to provide Google clients a way to purchase retargeted ads on Facebook. Google’s DoubleClick Bid Manager, previously Invite Media, had taken part in Facebook’s FBX, a real-time bidding exchange and retargeted ads platform. The agreement was to allow DoubleClick to turn into a more across-the-board ad buying software once it starts tapping into FBX, a key player only 16 months after it was launched. DoubleClick has helped marketing agencies and advertisers purchase ads and ad space on several ad exchanges for quite a while now. Up until 2013, the ad buying solution prevented exchanges from Facebook, but it forced a number of clients to jump ship and find other solutions for their media buying requirements. DoubleClick allows its clients to access dozens of public and private exchanges in more than 75 countries, with the last quarter having the largest ad spending in its history. Once the FBX integration turns live, DoubleClick will turn into a more comprehensive, one-stop-shop for purchasing ads on the Internet. Google DoubleClick is the company’s ad-serving subsidiary that provides both agencies and media outfits the needed tools to target and track their online ad campaigns. Through the platform [DoubleClick Bid Manager], advertisers are able to control their problematic ad purchasing, creating and measuring campaigns across desktop, mobile, and video from a centralized dashboard. “In addition, to help brands and agencies understand the effectiveness of their TV campaigns, we will be providing impact-based metrics in DoubleClick. For example, an advertiser will be able to measure the lift when someone searches for their brand on Google or YouTube after seeing their TV ad. “Programmatic technology has already automated some of the manual processes associated with buying digital video, and with these new integrations we’ll be extending many of the same workflow improvements to traditional TV” Rany added.

Copyless pasting allows users to look at text on Chrome without selecting it, and then switch to another app where Assistant will suggest terms from the Chrome you were looking at to paste. The code documentation for the new function provides a deeper understanding of the new feature. “Provide suggestions for text input, based on your recent context. For example, if you looked at a restaurant website and switched to the Maps app, the keyboard would offer the name of that restaurant as a suggestion to enter into the search bar. The data is indexed locally and never sent to the server. It’s disabled in incognito mode.” This function should be available within the next few months on Chrome 60 for Android. The current coding for Copyless Pasting shows the feature will not work while in Incognito Mode, nor will it be available on low-end devices, according to VentureBeat. Copyless Pasting is just one of the features coming to Android in the near future. With Google I/O on the horizons — May 17th to May 19th — we’re expecting to see a variety of other new features come to Android devices.

A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You also can get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. The producers of “Sesame Street” show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture. Separately, a new “I’m Feeling Lucky” feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken, part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. The update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or “getting lost.” With the update, Google Earth now works on Google’s Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there’s no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Some older features will still require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook’s Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive. But it won’t work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google’s Daydream and Samsung’s Gear VR.

The Yi Halo is the brainchild of Google and Yi, a company owned by Xiaomi. Google had previously collaborated with GoPro to make the Odyssey, but turned to one of GoPro’s competitor for its latest creation. Google and Yi also worked with film creators from the get-go in order to get their input. The Yi Halo boasts seventeen different Yi 4K cameras with sixteen along the circumference and one in the middle. The cameras can produce 8K x 8K stereoscopic VR content at 30fps and 6K x 6K content at 60 frames per second. The camera in the center is placed as low as possible to produce more seamless films. Emily Price, a Jump product manager, noted, “The upward-facing camera's view of the world is pretty different from the cameras on the main ring. If it were on top, it doesn't stitch as smoothly as you'd like.” Users will be able to download an Android app for the device that works as a remote control and provides live previews. The app will be able to adjust features like ISO, white balance, and flat color mode. Users will also be able to download firmware directly from the app or touch screen panel. According to Price, “The camera was designed with the software in mind”. The “Jump Assembler”  can take the seventeen different inputs and combine them into one 360° image. The stitching is automated and only takes a few hours as opposed to a few weeks. The device also can provide time-lapse mode, automatic depth map generation, and crisp focus. To top everything off, the Yi Halo is particularly light for a 360° VR device -- the rig only weighs in at 7.7 lbs. There is also a built-in battery that can provide up to 100 minutes of footage (it can accommodate third-party batteries as well).  The Yi Halo will ring in at $16,999 USD, however, some content creators may be able to snag one for free. Google is offering one hundred filmmakers access to its program “Jump Start”, which will give them free access to one Yi Halo and use of Jump Assembler. The deadline is May 22nd and interested content creators can sign-up here.

Sanctions Against North Korea ImmigrationTrump Backs Down From Border Wall Funding Demand to Avoid a Government Shutdown Commentary Mastering Data Why Google Books Deserves Better Than These Obituaries Jeff John Roberts Apr 24, 2017 When scholars of the future look back at the early 21st century, they'll point to technology milestones like the first iPhone and the Tesla Roadster. They'll also include another milestone—a fabulous digital library built by Google—and wonder why the world did so little to appreciate it. As many people know, Google spent hundreds of millions of dollars to scan the collections of great libraries of Oxford, Stanford and New York City and elsewhere. The result is the most valuable repository of knowledge and culture in history: A present day Library of Alexandria spanning centuries of works in many languages, and accessible anywhere there's an Internet connection. But despite this staggering achievement, recent accounts of Google Books read like a review of a failed tech product. A recent feature in Backchannel, for instance, portrays the project as one of Google's so-called moonshots that came crashing down to earth. Titled "How Google Books Got Lost," the article casts the whole endeavor, which included a lawsuit from the Authors Guild, as a smug morality play that delivers a comeuppance to a reckless technology company. As Scott Rosenberg at Backchannel highlights: [The legal fight] taught Google something valuable. As the Authors Guild’s Gleick points out, Google started Books with a “better ask forgiveness than permission” attitude that’s common today in the world of startups. In a sense, the company behaved like the Uber of intellectual property — a kind of read-sharing service —while expecting to be seen the way it saw itself, as a beneficent pantheon of wizards serving the entire human species. It was naive, and the stubborn opposition it aroused came as a shock. This sort of clucking is tiresome, but also misinformed. I talked to people at Google while doing a masters thesis on the scanning project in 2010, and learned the lawsuit didn't come as a surprise to anyone involved. Instead, they had long anticipated it, and planned to parry it with a clever settlement proposal. The proposed deal (which a judge rejected in 2011) may have been controversial, but there was nothing naive about it. It's also worth noting that if the judge had blessed the deal, the resulting business model for books could have been big—though nowhere near as dominant as what Amazon had built already. Related UberFormer Lyft Driver Sues Uber Over ‘Hell’ Tracking Program Uber Former Lyft Driver Sues Uber Over ‘Hell’ Tracking Program Unfortunately, the copyright case over Google Books morphed into something larger. It became a vehicle for anxieties over how the digital era has undermined authors on a financial and cultural level. Those concerns are legitimate, but scapegoating Google Books for these fears was misguided. Meanwhile, groups like the Authors Guild continue to celebrate the collapse of the settlement even though no other options have emerged to replicate its potential benefits. Those benefits would have included a new market for digital copies of old books, and a solution to the problem of "orphan works"—books whose authors cannot be located that are out-of-print but still under copyright protection. Instead, there is stasis. Copyright law is broken — but fixing it for one massive and feckless internet company is worse than doing nothing. 38/- James Grimmelmann (@grimmelm) April 23, 2017 "Rumors of the demise.. are greatly exaggerated" The case for what Google Books might have been is the focus of a second feature, published in the Atlantic this month. Titled "Torching the Library of Alexandria," the piece is a lamentation for dashed dreams, and a tidy summary of how legal thrashings around the book-scanning project sapped its spirit. "It was strange to me, the idea that somewhere at Google there is a database containing 25-million books and nobody is allowed to read them. It’s like that scene at the end of the first Indiana Jones movie where they put the Ark of the Covenant back on a shelf somewhere, lost in the chaos of a vast warehouse," The Atlantic's James Somers concludes. Subscribe to Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology. The conclusion is melodramatic, however, as is the article's title. While Google's digital library hasn't delivered all of its promised bounty, it's hardly been "torched." Indeed, anyone can still search Google Books for nearly any book—or even just a phrase from it—and find it right away, often with the opportunity to see entire pages of the work. That's pretty marvelous, and there's nothing else like it. "Rumors of the demise of Google Books are greatly exaggerated, and we can assure you that the team working on the product is excited about what's in the pipeline," said a Google spokesperson. The company didn't offer further details, but a person familiar with the project said Google is still working with libraries to add new works, and that current engineering efforts are focused on improving the quality of older scans. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said there's no chance Google will abruptly shut down the project—as it's done with other popular services such as Google Reader—in part because many senior members of the company are fiercely attached to it. But if Google is to dispel the recent mutterings about the project's decline, it must do more to raise the profile of Google Books, and offer some assurances about how it will ensure the collection—which, recall, is nothing less than the history of human knowledge—will survive. Ideally, the company should create a trust or foundation to manage it so as to ensure it endures no matter what corporate changes come at Google. Meanwhile, it's time for Google Books opponents to acknowledge the astonishing thing Google has built. Critics like the former head of Harvard libraries, Robert Darnton, have long suggested some university or public consortium can replicate the project. But today it's clearer than ever this is just a pipeline, and no one will muster the money, energy, and technology to do what Google did also over again. The bottom line is Google Books is one of the greatest technological marvels of our time. Let's treat it that way. It deserves better than fraught obituaries and gloating about its shortcomings.

The six Android Wear 2.0 changes you should check out first Video LG G6 vs Google Pixel Camera Showdown Whether you have a new Android Wear 2.0 watch or a first-gen model that just received an update, they’re about to get a lot more buffed. We already know the new Google Fit app brings a bunch of new trackers and motivators for workout buffs, but in the latest update, Google is finally turning on the best new feature. Back when we reviewed the LG Sport and Style watches, we noted a strange difference between them regarding one of Google Fit’s better features. On the Sport, we were able to activate Strength Training, which used the watch’s sensors to automatically track what we were doing (situps, weight lifting, etc.) and count our reps. But on the Style that option wasn’t present, and we couldn’t figure out why. Apparently there wasn’t a good reason. The new Google Fit Android Wear update delivers Strength Training to all Android Wear 2.0 watches new and old. To find it, you’ll need to select the Fit Workout companion app and scroll down to Strength Training. We checked, and the option is now live on our LG Style Watch running version 1.64 of Google Fit. In addition to Strength Training, the app update also brings a new unit settings feature. To access it, and scroll down to the bottom of the main screen until you get to Settings. Tap it and you’ll see a Units option that lets you switch between the metric and imperial system. The update is rolling out to Android Wear 2.0 watches, but you can side load the Google-signed APK from APK Mirror. Strength in numbers: While older and even many newer Android Wear 2.0 watches won’t be able to take advantage of Android Pay, the fitness benefits are available to all. And the new update will finally bring the best feature to all watches, taking them one step closer to becoming the personal trainers we know they can be. Now, if only Google could hurry up and bring it to more watches. To comment on this article and other Greenbot content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Google Fit v1.64 for Wear 2.0 can now identify strength training exercises and automatically count reps [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/24 8:19am PDTApr 24, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares125 Android Wear Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Automatically track strength exercises 1.2 Unit Settings 2 Download Google Fit stands as one of Google's only flagship apps on Android Wear, and may be the only one of its apps that matters more on a watch than it does on a phone. There's a new version of the app available on the Play Store for both watches and phones, but this update is all about adding a big feature for Wear. There's a new mode for recording strength training and similar activities that involve counting reps. This update is for Wear 2.0 only, so quite a few people will have to wait until the rollout is complete before testing this out, but it works on the last developer preview as well as any watch that already has the official 2.0 firmware. What's New Official Changelog: Automatically track your strength training exercises on your Android Wear smartwatch. Minor improvements. Bug fixes. Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Settings for units of measure Automatically track strength exercises Did you pick up a Wear device with the intention of recording workouts, then found that there wasn't much you could get out of the box? Sure, you could look to other apps, but if you wanted to use Google Fit, it only supported a few specific activities like walking and running, bicycling, and push-ups; but this did nothing for the wide range of exercises that you can and should do to get in shape. The new version of Google Fit expands the tracking capabilities significantly with a new Strength Training tool that greatly increases the range of activities that can be measured. To launch the Strength Training tracker, either open the "Fit Workout" item from the app launcher on Wear or open the Fit app and tap on the pink button to begin an activity, then look through the list for Strength Training. Once your session is recording, Google Fit will analyze motion of the watch to determine what you're doing and how many reps you've completed. When your set is complete, tap the button at the bottom and Fit will present your rep count. If you're keeping track of the count in your head and the numbers don't match up, you can adjust the count by sliding the top number to the left or right. If you're using weights, you should also slide the second number to the left to record the actual weight. Then scroll down a bit to the buttons titled Save, Delete, or Save and Exit. Saving the set will open up a follow-up screen with a countdown for resting before beginning the next set. In my very brief test, Fit successfully guessed I was doing bicep curls. I'm not sure about the rep count on that one, I was busy fiddling with screenshots. On my second test, I happened to switch arms and change the orientation of the watch, and this may have been enough to fool Fit into thinking I had taken to doing sit-ups. If this happens, you can tap the name of the exercise at the top to set the correct activity. For what it's worth, the rep count was correct. Overall, this is a pretty big addition and makes Wear considerably more useful for fitness tracking, especially in the gym. The workflow might still be a little cumbersome if each new set is supposed to happen immediately after the last, but this is still fine for most traditional workouts. Note: This feature was technically available on the stock firmware for the LG Watch Sport and possibly Style when they were fresh out of the box, but it seemed to disappear with either a server-side switch or an update to the Fit app. With this update, it's back for those watches and now available for all other watches on Wear 2.0. Unit Settings There is one other change worth noting, although it probably go mostly ignored. If you find that the units of measurement aren't to your liking, they can now be changed right on the watch. Just open Google Fit, scroll to the bottom to find the button to open Settings, then tap on the Units button. You can make changes for Height, Weight, Distance, and Energy. Most people probably won't need this, but it's a little more important now that Wear is intended to operate with less reliance on a paired phone. It makes sense if some users don't set up the app on a phone before using it on a watch for the first time. There's no harm in having it there.

Most AW watches I see are pretty nice. Too nice to want to wear as I work out in a gym with free weights. Wouldn't this make more sense with a partnering fitness tracker that you could wear with or without a nice watch? Morten Ulv I work out with a Urbane 2nd ed. Don't really understand what the issues would be? Doug McHone Isn't that watch a nicer piece of wear than what you would typically have on while working up a sweat? It just seems out of place for that application to me. I would rather AW make a fitness tracker similar to a fitbit for swimming and rigorous exercising. Morten Ulv I guess I just don't mind. I guess it could be nice with a fitness tracker companion, but then you might as well just use some existing one? Fitbit doesn't natively sync with Google Fit though, but there are workarounds. I use the watch for music as well (and calls since the Fitness Center watch my kids while I work out and call me if something is up), and then a fitness tracker wouldn't work. John Doe What happened to all the health tracking stuff? http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/01/25/google-play-services-v10-2-prepares-for-google-fit-v2-api-and-fido-certified-security-keys-apk-teardown/ Cody Toombs What do you mean? It hasn't launched yet. John Doe I thought it would launch with Android Wear 2.0. You know, Google Fit v2.0 and Android Wear 2.0? "Rumors have circulated for a while that Fit v2.0 will launch alongside Android Wear 2.0 next month." Cody Toombs Yeah, it definitely would have made sense, but it seems like they're still holding this back. Given that it didn't happen with Wear 2.0, and we're already staring down the barrel of I/O, the odds are pretty good that it will be announced (and probably released) next month. John Doe Google is really fucking things up with Android wear. It would be very embarrassing if I/O is here and all Android wear watches that were promised to be updated are not updated by that time. surethom Still not heart rate monitor Liam Alexander Colman This is also available on my Moto 360 Sport which hasn't been updated yet. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/76b7df372790b088b874c4e00d18392755bba1454b663e00ea922c85b82e6af3.jpg Antti Elonheimo I was about to comment the same. Haven't​ yet tested it out though. Liam Alexander Colman I have done some push ups and it worked ;) Antti Elonheimo Did it record heart rate data for you? I tested it also and it didn't. During rest it showed heart rate with something like "HR: --" under the timer. Don't know if something is wrong or not. It doesn't even show that in the screenshots in AP article. Liam Alexander Colman Yep same with the HR for me. Counts the reps though perfectly! Chewieez Same here. I used it today on my moto 360 sport. It automatically recognized jumping jacks and push ups and squats. It missed side lunges, but it was easy to input the workout. HR didn't seem to be recorded. surethom Google fit wear app is good but it's missing regular heart rate monitoring & sleep tracking F4LL0U7 Agreed, if they could keep the heart rate monitor active during your workouts, it would be great. F4LL0U7 They'd also need to let us do something with that information. When I manually measure my heartrate, that info seems to just disappear. Vadim Shun I cannot imagine it being able to detect pull-ups, chin-ups and headstand push- ups which are staple of my routine in a gym since hands in these exercises are largely stationary in these positions. Also still cannot take watch for activities such as whitewater kayaking so, while helpful for some, the app will still be disabled for me to save on battery. Morten Ulv I just tested chin-ups and it detected it perfectly. No clue how it does it though. Too weak to do headstand push-ups though, sorry! ;) Morten Ulv Detected push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, bicep curls without fault. Bench press was detected as Overhead press, but I just faked it on a sofa, so that might have caused it. Was easy to change it manually though (came up as first alternative). Maximilian Keppeler As a developer of a Push-Ups app, is there an API for identifying exercises? (Push-Ups) Taa Ynwa You don't need AW 2.0 for this. This works perfectly fine on my LG Watch Urbane 2 running AW 1.5 and Google Fit 1.64. Jaime Lopez If you start Sports Gear Tracker on watch and start Fit strength training workout on watch, fit will show average heart rate on fit strength training workout summary. So , both are running at same time. If you teach fit what movement you did after it tries to guess (i.e.) hand stand push up, it will learn the movement. My watch also shows"HR--" so keep hoping it is coming. I have LG Urbane and use Barton quick change bands to make it more workout suitable.

Name: Subject: Message: Bixby vs Google Assistant vs Siri Features Newsby Robert Triggs11 hours ago 8 720 20 2017 is shaping up to be the year of the virtual assistant, with Google and Amazon already rolling out their new Assistant and Alexa software to more devices over previous months. Not forgetting that Apple’s Siri has already nabbed a big share of the smartphone market, tucked away in every iPhone, and Microsoft continues to focus on Cortana. Samsung has also announced its new virtual assistant – Bixby – this year. However, Samsung’s voice assistant is only available in South Korea at launch, will be rolling out to the US later in the spring, and other parts of the world over the coming year. Here’s how the big three – Bixby, Google Assistant, and Siri – stack up against one another. The first major difference between the three is the way that users interact with them. Google Assistant and Siri rely on the tried and tested method of a hot word command, triggered either by a long press on the home button or always-on listening. “OK Google” and “Hey Siri” are terms that consumers are probably quite familiar with, but Samsung’s Bixby views these as an unnecessary step. Bixby is instead started up with a quick press of the dedicated button on the left side of Samsung’s Galaxy S8. From there, users can simply speak whatever command they wish, without the need for a polite precursor. 'OK Google' and 'Hey Siri' are terms that consumers are probably quite familiar with, but Samsung's Bixby views these as an unnecessary step. Opting for a dedicated button immediately makes Bixby feel quite different to use. If you don’t feel like speaking, all three are also capable of fulfilling requests via text inputs. Bixby takes this one step further by also supporting image inputs, either directly from the camera, by searching through your gallery of existing pictures, or by looking up pictures through the company’s web browser. Bixby then provides contextual information, such as business listings, information on a landmark, or even details about a famous face identified in the picture. This isn’t entirely new though, Google Now on Tap can accomplish similar results by performing a search based on what’s currently on your screen. See also: Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus review: Almost to Infinity 7 days ago The key thing here is that Bixby offers a slightly different take on how users will interact with it, compared with Google Assistant and Siri, for better or for worse. But the Bixby Button is not the feature that’s going to define the user experience. App integration The other big differentiator with the other three is just how far Samsung has gone with integrating Bixby into its other apps. For instance, Bixby can create a new album from pictures in your gallery or change your wallpaper to a newly taken picture. Samsung is looking to take the hassle out of scrolling through multiple menus, but this functionality is limited only to the handful of apps that Bixby supports – just 10 at launch. Samsung says that more apps on the way after launch, including support for third party applications once it opens up its Bixby SDK. That being said, the Bixby Home page does support cards and information from a wider variety of apps already. Samsung isn’t the only assistant with notable app integration though, both Google Assistant and Siri work with a selection of compatible apps too. Google Assistant is integrated into the company’s Allo messenger, Photos, and Play Music. Google Assistant also lists Youtube, Spotify, Netflix, Uber, and other among the third-party apps that are currently supported, with more on the way.   Bixby Siri Google Assistant Trigger Dedicated button Hot-word ("Hey Siri") Hot-word ("OK Google") Voice Search Yes Yes Yes Text Search Yes Yes Yes Camera Search Yes No No Contextual Info Yes Yes Yes Reminders Yes Yes Yes Smart Home Yes Yes Yes Info cards Yes No Yes Third-party apps Supported Yes Yes Languages 2 (more on the way) 21 40 (Voice Search) 5 (Assistant Voice) Similarly, Siri, iOS 10, and SiriKit have gotten a number of developers on-board with Apple’s virtual assistant too. Yelp, Facebook, Pinterest, WhatsApp, PayPal, Lyft, Uber, and others are currently supported on Apple’s platform, allowing users to perform a wide variety of tasks using just their voice. Of course Google Assistant, Siri and Bixby are all integrated with the phone’s core functions to similar extents. Doing the basics, such as making calls, sending messages, setting reminders, and adding dates to your calendar, among other things, is done in pretty much the same way with all three assistants. All in all, there’s a different selection of apps with varying levels of support across these different assistant platforms, so picking the one for you might come down to the apps you use the most. Being the newest platform, Bixby is at a disadvantage in terms of third-party apps, but it will likely catch up in time. If you’re a big fan of Samsung’s own apps though, Bixby does offer deeper integration in certain situations than other virtual assistants. Wearables and fitness One of the major announcements with Android Wear 2.0 was the introduction of Google Assistant, bringing the smart features to wearables. Unfortunately, with few of the existing wearables being updated to Android Wear 2.0, only a selection of Android smartwatches will get to make use of this feature in the immediate future. See also: Best Android Wear watches 2 weeks ago Siri, on the other hand, is a big part of the Apple Watch, offering up voice commands for a lot of the smartwatch’s main features. Playing music, sending messages, and even toggling many of the watch’s settings can be done through voice commands, making it particularly useful given the limited screen space. Given that Bixby is making its debut in the Galaxy S8, there’s no wearable implementation yet, but that doesn’t mean that Samsung is neglecting the market. Samsung Health is a prominent card on the Bixby homepage, meaning that step, workout, and other fitness information from Samsung’s lineup of wearables can already be brought into the assistant. The smart assistant looks like it will eventually find itself installed inside Samsung wearables in the future too, although the company hasn’t confirmed and official plans outside of suggesting that at least the Gear S3 will see an upgrade. Building your smart home Apple’s Siri may still be mostly an iPhone- and Watch-centric feature, but the assistant is compatible with a range of third-party smart home production on the market, through the company’s HomeKit initiative. Google and Samsung are going further by developing their own smart home products with integrated assistants. Samsung has already demoed Bixby transferring the Galaxy S8’s display directly to one of the company’s smart TVs and viewing the contents of its latest smart fridge, and these Samsung Home features will work with Bixby at launch. We don’t know exactly how far Samsung plans to extend its smart home integration with Bixby, but we imagine that the focus will be on the company’s SmartThings range of products first and foremost. See also: Sony’s Android TVs will be the first televisions with Google Assistant February 10, 2017 Google Assistant is already well ahead in this regard, with support integrated into a number of IoT devices and already playing nicely with Google Home, Google WiFi, and Nest thermostats. Using IFTTT also means that you can users can link Google Assistant up with a wider range of gear. There’s some setup required, but this grants user control over their lights by saying something like “OK Google, switch on the living room lights”, providing that you have compatible hardware. Don’t miss: The complete list of services with Google Home support Compatible devices Of course, a virtual assistant is only useful if you can actually use it. Samsung’s Bixby is only launching on the Galaxy S8, meaning that it’s going to have a smaller market share in the immediate term than its competitors. However, Samsung has stated that Bixby will be coming to other devices, including smart home products, and it’s possible that other handsets launched this year and updated older models may receive the assistant in the future. Google Assistant originally launched on the company's Pixel handsets, but is now compatible with handsets running Android 6.0 or newer. Google Assistant originally launched on the company’s Pixel handsets, but has since appeared inside LG, HTC, and Samsung flagships via updates. In fact, it’s now officially supported on Android 6.0 and newer smartphones that receive an updated Google Search app. This means that around 30 percent of Android phones either already have or could soon have access to Google Assistant. Siri can be found on a large share of smartphones, particularly in the West, thanks to the market share held by iPhones and the fact that the company has been using the same assistant for multiple generations. It’s going to take Bixby a while to catch up with Siri, but it might not take as long as some expect, given Samsung’s wider range of handsets sold each year. Bixby Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus (smart home and wearables in the future) Siri iPhone 4S and newer Apple Watch Google Assistant Google Pixel & Pixel XL Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches Google Home Rolling out to other phones running Android 6.0 and up Wrap up Picking a winner at this early stage isn’t really possible, especially as there are a number of different capabilities and aims spread across the three virtual assistants. Google’s effort has a notable advantage as it will be arriving on many more devices going forward. Meanwhile Siri has no real competition on the iPhone, leaving it with a comfortable market share also. Bixby is perhaps in the most precarious spot, as it’s going to be competing directly against Google Assistant on some devices. Bixby’s capabilities sound quite impressive thanks to its integration with other Samsung apps, but third party support is going to be the key to competing with Google, and this is where Samsung has some serious catching up to do. Comparing features side by side, all of these assistants look to offer up very similar experiences, the differences at the moment are mostly down to app support and implementation.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Electronics Google Unveils Stunning 17-Camera VR Video Rig Google Unveils Stunning 17-Camera VR Video Rig By Ryan Whitwam on April 24, 2017 at 2:18 pm Comment Virtual reality is more accessible than ever with devices like Gear VR and Daydream that can plug into your smartphone. However, there’s dearth of worthwhile VR video content out there. Google is trying to fix that with its Jump video platform. Today, the company has announced a new and improved VR video rig called the Yi Halo. It can film multiple 4K video streams simultaneously, then feed it all into Google’s special video processor to create a VR experience. Google announced Jump in 2015 along with a virtual reality camera rig called Odyssey, which was powered by 16 GoPro cameras. It was a bit more DIY in that the $15,000 bundle included a counting bracket and 16 HERO4 cameras to plug in. The Yi Halo, on the other hand, is its own product. Yi Technology designed the rig to be simpler to use and more compact than the Odyssey (it weighs under 8 pounds). The Yi Halo has 17 cameras, each one capably of filming in 4K resolution. Importantly, 16 of them are spaced equidistant around the outside of the rig. Then, there’s one in the middle of the array pointed upward. Anyone who has viewed VR video knows there is often a missing blob directly above the viewer if you look up. The Yi Halo avoids that with the extra camera. It even comes with two backup cameras in case you break one. These units appear to be closely related to Yi’s standard 4K action camera, but the housing and power supply are different. They plug into the rig vertically and there’s just a single main battery pack. That means you don’t have to worry about connector brackets or batteries for individual cameras. It’s good for up to 100 minutes of 360-degree video recording. The top-facing camera. There is a touch-screen control panel on the Yi Halo itself, but there’s also an Android app. It allows for remote control of the rig, as well as preview of the video it captures. To produce a VR video, the footage has to be uploaded to Google’s cloud, where computer vision tech is used to merge all the individual feeds into one video. Yi Technology has not announced a price for the Halo, but it’ll probably be expensive. Even if it’s somewhat cheaper than the Odyssey, that bundle was still $15,000.

The Flyer will become available for sale by the end of 2017. (Davis ELEN/Kitty Hawk Corporation/AFP) 25 Apr 2017 02:57AM Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail WASHINGTON: A Silicon Valley "flying car" startup, Kitty Hawk, reportedly backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, released a video on Monday (Apr 24) of its airborne prototype and announced plans for deliveries of a "personal flying machine" this year. "Our mission is to make the dream of personal flight a reality. We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them," said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google's home town of Mountain View, California. "Today we're announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017." The video showed the single-seat aircraft - with two pontoons and a spider web-like platform - taking off from a lake at an undisclosed location and hovering above the water, where it is meant to be used. The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 100 kilogrammes and fly at speeds up to 40 kilometres per hour, and can hover at 4.5 metres high. Advertisement The company describes the Flyer as "a new, all-electric aircraft," which is "safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas" under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot's license is required, and two hours' training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google's self-driving car, tweeted: "Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype." The company announced it was offering three-year "memberships" for US$100 to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. LIMITED DETAILS The startup offered only limited details about the company. An email response to an AFP query said the lead engineers were Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, who created a startup called Aerovelo which aims to produce the fastest human-powered vehicle. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. A blog post by writer Cimeron Morrissey, who took the flyer for a test run, offered some clues on how it feels. "The prototype looks and feels a lot like a flying motorcycle. You mount the seat and lean forward, just like you would on a bike," she wrote. "I feel light and ecstatic and utterly free. This is just like my flying dreams!" Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines.

Marketers want to provide consumers with online experiences on par with those from the digital giants, but agencies struggle to hire the talent required. Credit: Jane_Kelly/iStock Most Popular Clients want us to deliver online experiences that are competitive with Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google and other top-tier tech companies because that's what consumers demand. This has created a war for talent unlike anything I've seen in my career. While it must be fought, it can never be won because the rules are not what they seem. Our clients want web and native experiences that look, feel, and perform like they were built by Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. (And they want the back-end systems to support them). Each of these companies build with very specific programming languages and frameworks. If you want to build a project for a client that looks and feels as good as Facebook, why wouldn't you use their code? They have massive teams of designers and engineers with unique combinations of aesthetics, aptitude, and technical skills. So, we are on a Grail Quest for similar talent -- the best of the best React/Redux specialists, Unity developers, data scientists, and data engineers (proficient with TensorFlow), technical project managers (who used to do the above, but have evolved into managers) and technical account executives. The problem is, if you're good enough to work for us, you're good enough to work for them, or anyone else for that matter. And while we have done our best to build a yellow brick road to our company, the yellow brick road that leads to top-tier tech actually has a metaphoric Emerald City at its end. Don't get me wrong; we have a small but mighty team and we fight considerably above our weight. But if we could win the talent war (or even just a few more battles), our growth potential would be unlimited. The last three perfect candidates took jobs at Google and Facebook instead of coming to work for us … not a big surprise. The Game Is Rigged Over the past few years, IT old-timers have started to accept open source as an excellent way to economically test, fail and learn. GitHub, the most popular open source community, is a haven for engineers. If you write great code, you are rewarded by popularity, as well as the accolades of your peers. It is one of the purest meritocracies in the world. GitHub is also the place where top-tier tech companies make would-be proprietary programming languages, frameworks, and tools available for free -- a Machiavellian move that allows engineers to self-select into a pool of qualified applicants perfectly trained to work for them. And, here's why the rules are not what they seem: If you build something popular on GitHub using Facebook's or Google's code, they will see it, and a recruiter will contact you. That's how the "GitHub recruiting pipeline" works. We Run a Business, Not a School I am personally amazed by the number of recruiters who have sent us "vetted" professional coders who can't actually code. This is such a serious problem that if a recruiter sends us three candidates who cannot pass our coding test, we fire the recruiter. We can't afford to waste the time. Tech recruiters charge 18% to 25% of the first year's salary, but even the best recruiters we've worked with cannot truly vet the types of engineers we need. As far as I can tell, recruiters are not under pressure to learn, because high-end tech talent is so rare, hiring managers will take practically anyone who can fog a mirror. We won't. And you shouldn't. In practice, we could train these workers, but not at market prices with added recruiter vigorish. We just can't get enough value out of B-team players while they are in training, and by the time we help them become A-team players, their GitHub accounts and contributions will reflect their learning. At that point, they will be firmly on the radar of top-tier tech. And we would have played the role of pre-school for Facebook, Google, or Apple. Great for Zuck, Larry, or Tim, but not so great for us. There Must Be Somewhere to Learn This Stuff There is somewhere to learn this stuff. You learn it by doing it every day and communicating with the community that is doing it every day. It's not taught in schools and it is constantly evolving. In fact, this may be top-tier tech's secret weapon. Just like Tim Cook (Apple) owns the physical supply chain for every component you might need to make a smartphone, top-tier tech literally owns the programming languages and frameworks used to create them -- even though they are free for all of us to use. Awesome and Insane None of this would be an issue if top-tier tech did not make its code available open source. We have this problem only because they need talent as much as we do. That said, we're going to keep looking for amazing programmers and my offer stands. I can't wait to pay you $500,000 per year. You just have to be an awesome and insane engineer with enough skills and work ethic to keep the work we do for our clients as good as the work at the biggest and best tech companies in the world. Feel free to send me a link to your GitHub account. No resumes required. A note from the author before you write a comment: It seems that some readers and tweeters are worried that I do not understand that there is more to talent recruiting and retention than money. I understand that very well, which is why we are blessed to work with some of the most talented people in the world. This article is about a narrow issue -- a lack of engineers with very specific, highly in-demand skill sets. It attempts to explain how top tier tech has strategically monopolized an incredibly important recruiting pipeline using open source. On that subject, I would welcome your thoughts.

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 24, 2017 2:04 PM EDT AMAZON.COM INC +8.88 At Closing, April 24th 907.41 USD APPLE INC +1.37 At Closing, April 24th 143.64 USD A recurring theme at Gadfly is Amazon.com Inc.'s ambitions to do everything under the sun. It looks as if the company now wants to become a quasi app store similar to Apple or Google's mobile versions. Amazon on Monday created a single spot for people to sign up to digital subscriptions from companies including the Los Angeles Times and digital file cabinet Dropbox. For the hundreds of millions of customers who have Amazon accounts tied to their credit cards, it's easier to buy from Amazon than handing over their personal information multiple times to sign up individually for Dropbox, the New Yorker and SlingTV.  Amazon has previously sold subscriptions such as these, but this is first time it has packaged them in one place for customers to browse and purchase. If what Amazon is doing sounds a lot like Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store for Android phones, you are correct.  Amazon Power Hundreds of millions of people buy something from Amazon each year, which gives the company enormous influence over purchases Source: Amazon disclosures on earnings calls Note: Amazon defines active customers as accounts that have purchased something over the prior 12 months. The company discloses this figure sporadically and has not updated the metric since early 2016. For now, Amazon's new digital subscription storefront is a pipsqueak. Amazon announces new products or services all the time that don't go anywhere. But the potential is intriguing. The app stores from Apple and Google are hugely powerful gatekeepers for sales of online music, newspapers and magazines, digital video packages, food delivery subscriptions and software. If you're a company that offers a digital service -- particularly ones like Spotify or newspapers that are commonly accessed on smartphones -- Apple and Google call the shots that influence your business and stand between your success and failure. Amazon is giving companies an alternative to distributing their digital subscriptions without relying on the storefronts controlled by Apple and Google. The new service is part of a trend at Amazon that isn't broadly understood. Of course everyone knows Amazon is the supreme gatekeeper for products. If your shoes or headphones aren't sold on Amazon, they don't exist in the minds of many shoppers. More quietly, Amazon has also become an influential storefront for non-physical things, too, like software subscriptions and online TV services.  And indeed, the new digital subscription storefront mimics one Amazon started in 2015 for online video subscription services like Starz and Seeso, a comedy-focused Web video service. Entertainment companies were initially skeptical about Amazon's motives but changed their minds. For some digital video channels, Amazon quickly became the single largest seller of their subscriptions, according to a report last fall in tech news outlet The Information.  For companies that aren't well known -- and even ones that are -- selling subscriptions is a grind. They have to splurge on ads to get noticed, try free marketing tricks or hope that Google or Apple decide to feature them in the highly visible home pages of their app stores. Subscription services can easily get lost in the cacophony of Amazon, too, but the company can also suggest that customers who buy a book of New Yorker cartoons also purchase a digital subscription to the magazine. Amazon is good at selling subscriptions to its own Prime shopping club, which analysts estimate has 60 million to 70 million members, and it could bring that expertise to bear to sell outsiders' subscriptions, too.  Prime Numbers Amazon in 2016 sold more than $6 billion of subscription services including its Prime shopping club and e-books Source: Amazon Note: The "other" category includes sales from advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements The real intrigue is whether Amazon would change the rules of the distribution game if it can join Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google as the gatekeepers for all sorts of digital goods. For companies that opt to sell digital subscriptions through Amazon, it is offering similar revenue sharing as Apple's recently revised business terms for companies that sell digital services. For a customer's first year as a subscriber, the owners of a digital subscription keeps 70 percent of the revenue and gives 30 percent to Amazon. After the first year, the company's cut goes up to 85 cents of every dollar from the subscription fee. Amazon's Initial Share of Digital Subscription Revenue 30% But what if Amazon decided to take an even smaller share of revenue from subscriptions, or none at all? Presumably that would put pressure on Apple and Google to follow suit. Companies have complained for years that they are giving away too much money to the owners of mobile app stores and would welcome an upstart who lets them keep a bigger slice of the pie. Spotify has gone so far as to recommend people pay for the music service away from Apple's App Store. For people who don't, the price of a Spotify subscription is 30 percent higher to offset the revenue it has to share with Apple.  For companies that rely on powerful gatekeepers like Google and Apple for their livelihood, an Amazon alternative for selling subscriptions could be a breath of fresh air.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Google Fit v1.64 for Wear 2.0 can now identify strength training exercises and automatically count reps [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/24 8:19am PDTApr 24, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares125 Android Wear Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Automatically track strength exercises 1.2 Unit Settings 2 Download Google Fit stands as one of Google's only flagship apps on Android Wear, and may be the only one of its apps that matters more on a watch than it does on a phone. There's a new version of the app available on the Play Store for both watches and phones, but this update is all about adding a big feature for Wear. There's a new mode for recording strength training and similar activities that involve counting reps. This update is for Wear 2.0 only, so quite a few people will have to wait until the rollout is complete before testing this out, but it works on the last developer preview as well as any watch that already has the official 2.0 firmware. What's New Official Changelog: Automatically track your strength training exercises on your Android Wear smartwatch. Minor improvements. Bug fixes. Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Settings for units of measure Automatically track strength exercises Did you pick up a Wear device with the intention of recording workouts, then found that there wasn't much you could get out of the box? Sure, you could look to other apps, but if you wanted to use Google Fit, it only supported a few specific activities like walking and running, bicycling, and push-ups; but this did nothing for the wide range of exercises that you can and should do to get in shape. The new version of Google Fit expands the tracking capabilities significantly with a new Strength Training tool that greatly increases the range of activities that can be measured. To launch the Strength Training tracker, either open the "Fit Workout" item from the app launcher on Wear or open the Fit app and tap on the pink button to begin an activity, then look through the list for Strength Training. Once your session is recording, Google Fit will analyze motion of the watch to determine what you're doing and how many reps you've completed. When your set is complete, tap the button at the bottom and Fit will present your rep count. If you're keeping track of the count in your head and the numbers don't match up, you can adjust the count by sliding the top number to the left or right. If you're using weights, you should also slide the second number to the left to record the actual weight. Then scroll down a bit to the buttons titled Save, Delete, or Save and Exit. Saving the set will open up a follow-up screen with a countdown for resting before beginning the next set. In my very brief test, Fit successfully guessed I was doing bicep curls. I'm not sure about the rep count on that one, I was busy fiddling with screenshots. On my second test, I happened to switch arms and change the orientation of the watch, and this may have been enough to fool Fit into thinking I had taken to doing sit-ups. If this happens, you can tap the name of the exercise at the top to set the correct activity. For what it's worth, the rep count was correct. Overall, this is a pretty big addition and makes Wear considerably more useful for fitness tracking, especially in the gym. The workflow might still be a little cumbersome if each new set is supposed to happen immediately after the last, but this is still fine for most traditional workouts. Note: This feature was technically available on the stock firmware for the LG Watch Sport and possibly Style when they were fresh out of the box, but it seemed to disappear with either a server-side switch or an update to the Fit app. With this update, it's back for those watches and now available for all other watches on Wear 2.0. Unit Settings There is one other change worth noting, although it probably go mostly ignored. If you find that the units of measurement aren't to your liking, they can now be changed right on the watch. Just open Google Fit, scroll to the bottom to find the button to open Settings, then tap on the Units button. You can make changes for Height, Weight, Distance, and Energy. Most people probably won't need this, but it's a little more important now that Wear is intended to operate with less reliance on a paired phone. It makes sense if some users don't set up the app on a phone before using it on a watch for the first time. There's no harm in having it there.

Wouldn't this make more sense with a partnering fitness tracker that you could wear with or without a nice watch? Morten Ulv I work out with a Urbane 2nd ed. Don't really understand what the issues would be? Doug McHone Isn't that watch a nicer piece of wear than what you would typically have on while working up a sweat? It just seems out of place for that application to me. I would rather AW make a fitness tracker similar to a fitbit for swimming and rigorous exercising. Morten Ulv I guess I just don't mind. I guess it could be nice with a fitness tracker companion, but then you might as well just use some existing one? Fitbit doesn't natively sync with Google Fit though, but there are workarounds. I use the watch for music as well (and calls since the Fitness Center watch my kids while I work out and call me if something is up), and then a fitness tracker wouldn't work. John Doe What happened to all the health tracking stuff? http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/01/25/google-play-services-v10-2-prepares-for-google-fit-v2-api-and-fido-certified-security-keys-apk-teardown/ Cody Toombs What do you mean? It hasn't launched yet. John Doe I thought it would launch with Android Wear 2.0. You know, Google Fit v2.0 and Android Wear 2.0? "Rumors have circulated for a while that Fit v2.0 will launch alongside Android Wear 2.0 next month." Cody Toombs Yeah, it definitely would have made sense, but it seems like they're still holding this back. Given that it didn't happen with Wear 2.0, and we're already staring down the barrel of I/O, the odds are pretty good that it will be announced (and probably released) next month. John Doe Google is really fucking things up with Android wear. It would be very embarrassing if I/O is here and all Android wear watches that were promised to be updated are not updated by that time. surethom Still not heart rate monitor Liam Alexander Colman This is also available on my Moto 360 Sport which hasn't been updated yet. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/76b7df372790b088b874c4e00d18392755bba1454b663e00ea922c85b82e6af3.jpg Antti Elonheimo I was about to comment the same. Haven't​ yet tested it out though. Liam Alexander Colman I have done some push ups and it worked ;) Antti Elonheimo Did it record heart rate data for you? I tested it also and it didn't. During rest it showed heart rate with something like "HR: --" under the timer. Don't know if something is wrong or not. It doesn't even show that in the screenshots in AP article. Liam Alexander Colman Yep same with the HR for me. Counts the reps though perfectly! Chewieez Same here. I used it today on my moto 360 sport. It automatically recognized jumping jacks and push ups and squats. It missed side lunges, but it was easy to input the workout. HR didn't seem to be recorded. surethom Google fit wear app is good but it's missing regular heart rate monitoring & sleep tracking F4LL0U7 Agreed, if they could keep the heart rate monitor active during your workouts, it would be great. F4LL0U7 They'd also need to let us do something with that information. When I manually measure my heartrate, that info seems to just disappear. Vadim Shun I cannot imagine it being able to detect pull-ups, chin-ups and headstand push- ups which are staple of my routine in a gym since hands in these exercises are largely stationary in these positions. Also still cannot take watch for activities such as whitewater kayaking so, while helpful for some, the app will still be disabled for me to save on battery. Morten Ulv I just tested chin-ups and it detected it perfectly. No clue how it does it though. Too weak to do headstand push-ups though, sorry! ;) Morten Ulv Detected push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, bicep curls without fault. Bench press was detected as Overhead press, but I just faked it on a sofa, so that might have caused it. Was easy to change it manually though (came up as first alternative). Maximilian Keppeler As a developer of a Push-Ups app, is there an API for identifying exercises? (Push-Ups) Taa Ynwa You don't need AW 2.0 for this. This works perfectly fine on my LG Watch Urbane 2 running AW 1.5 and Google Fit 1.64. Jaime Lopez If you start Sports Gear Tracker on watch and start Fit strength training workout on watch, fit will show average heart rate on fit strength training workout summary. So , both are running at same time. If you teach fit what movement you did after it tries to guess (i.e.) hand stand push up, it will learn the movement. My watch also shows"HR--" so keep hoping it is coming. I have LG Urbane and use Barton quick change bands to make it more workout suitable.

Twitter Facebook Deep dive on AWS vs. Azure vs. Google cloud storage options Comparing block, object and file storage across the three providers Brandon Butler (Network World) 25 April, 2017 04:18 - - - - print email Comments One of the most common use cases for public IaaS cloud computing is storage and that’s for good reason: Instead of buying hardware and managing it, users simply upload data to the cloud and pay for how much they put there. +MORE AT NETWORK WORLD: Battle of the clouds: AWS vs. Azure vs. Google Cloud Platform | Interactive map of public cloud regions around the world + It sounds simple. But in reality, the world of cloud storage has many facets to consider. Each of the three major public IaaS cloud vendors – Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform – have a variety of storage options and in some cases complicated schemes for how much it costs. According to Brian Adler, director of enterprise architecture at cloud management provider RightScale, who recently ran a webinar comparing cloud storage options, there is no one vendor that is clearly better than the others. “Is anyone in the lead? It really depends on what you’re using (the cloud) for,” he says. Each provider has their own strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific use case, he says. Below are three of the most common cloud storage use cases and how the vendors stack up. Block Storage Block storage is persistent disk storage used in conjunction with cloud-based virtual machines. Each of the providers break their block storage offerings into two categories: traditional magnetic spinning hard-drive disks, or newer solid state disks (SSD), which are generally more expensive but have better performance. Customers can also pay a premium to get a certain amount of guaranteed input/output per second (IOPs), which basically is an indication of how fast the storage will save new information and read information stored in it. Amazon’s product is named Elastic Block Store (EBS) and it comes in three main flavors: Throughput Optimized HHD, a traditional magnetic, spinning-disk offering; General Purpose SSD, next-generation drives; and Provisioned IOPS SSD, which come with a guaranteed rate of reads and writes to the data. Azure’s block storage offering is called Managed Disks and comes in standard or premium with the latter based on SSDs. Google’s version is named Persistent Disks (PDs), which come in a standard or SSD option. Rightscale AWS and Google have a 99.95% availability, while Azure offers a 99.99% availability service-level agreement (SLA) for block storage service. One of the most important factors to consider when buying block storage is how fast you need access to the data stored on the SSD disk. For that, the vendors offer different guaranteed rates of IOPs. Google is in the lead here; the company offers 40,000 IOPs for reads and 30,000 for writes to its disks. AWS’s general purpose SSD offers 10,000 IOPS, but its provisioned IOPs offering can offer up to 20,000 IOPs per instance, with a maximum IOPs of 65,000 per volume. Azure offers 5,000 IOPs. Google not only has the highest IOPs, but gives customers the most choice in the size of block storage volumes. For more traditional hard-drive based storage, Google offers volume sizes ranging from 1GB to 64TB. AWS offers volumes between 500GB to 16TB. Azure offers between 1GB and 1TB volume sizes. Like with the SSDs, Google offers the highest level of IOPs-per-volume in HDDs, at 3,000 for reads and 15,000 for writes. AWS and Azure are at 500 max IOPs per volume. Max throughput ranges from Azure are 60 MBps to Google at 180 for read and 120 for write, and AWS at 500 MBps. As for pricing, it gets a bit complicated (all prices are per GB/month), but for HHD, AWS starts at $0.045, for Google it's $0.04 and Azure is $0.03. SSD pricing starts at $0.10 in AWS, $0.17 for Google and between $0.12 and 0.14 for Azure, depending on the size of the disk. In a pricing analysis done by RightScale, the company found that generally the pricing structure means that Azure has the best price/performance ratio for block storage. But, for workloads that require higher IOPs, Google becomes the more cost-effective option. RELATED: How a giant like GE found a home in the cloud There are caveats when using provisioned IOPs, says Kim Weins, vice president of marketing at RightScale. In AWS, if you need a guaranteed amount of IOPs, that costs a premium. “You pay a higher cost per GB, but you also pay for the required IOPs on top of it, which drives the cost up higher,” Weins says. “Be smart about choosing your provisioned IOPs level because you are going to be paying for it.” Weins adds that RightScale has found some customers pay provisioned IOPs then forgot to deprovision the EBS instance when they are done using it, thus wasting money. Object storage Got a file that you need to put in the cloud? Object storage is the service for you. Again, the cloud providers have different types of storage, classified by how often the customer expects to access it. “Hot” storage is data that needs to be almost instantaneously accessible. “Cool” storage is accessed more infrequently, and "cold" storage is archival material that is rarely accessed. The colder the storage, the less expensive it is. AWS’s primary object storage platform is Simple Storage Service (S3). It offers S3 Infrequent Access for cool storage and Glacier for cold storage. Google has Google Cloud Storage, GCS Nearline for cool storage and GCS Coldline for archival. Azure only has a hot and cool option with Azure Hot and Cool Storage Blobs; customers have to use the cool storage for archival data. AWS and Google each have a 5TB object size limit, while Azure has a 500TB per account limit. AWS and Google each publicize 99.999999999% durability for objects stored in their cloud. That means that if you store 10,000 objects in the cloud, on average one file will be lost every 10 million years, AWS says. The point is these systems are designed to be ultra durable. Azure does not publish durability service level agreements. Rightscale Pricing on object storage is slightly more complicated because customers can choose to host their data in a single region, or for a slightly increased cost they can back it up across multiple regions, which is a best-practice to ensure you have access to your data if there is an outage in a region. In AWS, for example, S3 costs (all prices are in GB/month) $0.023; to replicate data across multiple regions costs twice as much: $0.046, plus a $0.01 per GB transfer fee. AWS’s cool storage service, named S3 Infrequent Access (IA) is $0.0125 and its cold storage/archival service Glacier costs $0.004. Google has the most analogous offerings: It’s single-region storage costs $0.02, while multi-region is $0.026, with free transfer of data. The company’s cool storage platform named Nearline is $0.01 and the cold/archival product named Coldline is $0.007. Google says data retrieval from Coldline is faster (within milliseconds) than in Glacier, which AWS says could take between minutes and hours. Azure offers single-region storage for $0.0184, and what it calls “Globally Redundant Storage” for $0.046, but it is read only, which means you cannot write changes to it, doing so costs more money. Azure’s cool storage is named Cool Blob Storage is $0.01. Azure does not yet offer a cold or archival storage platform, so customers must use Cool Blob storage for that use case. RELATED: How Notre Dame is going all in with Amazon’s cloud Based on these pricing scenarios, Google has the least expensive pure object storage costs, plus the free transfer of data, RightScale found. AWS, however, beats Google on cold storage costs. File Storage An emerging use case is the use of a cloud-based file storage system. Think of this as a cloud-based version of a more traditional Network File System (NFS): Users can mount files to the system from any device or VM connected to it, then read and retrieve files. This is a relatively nascent cloud storage use case and therefore offerings are not yet as full featured compared to block and object storage, Adler says. AWS’s offering in this category is named Elastic File Storage, which emerged from beta in June 2016. It allows users to mount files from AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) virtual machines, or from on-premises services using AWS Direct Connect or a virtual private connection (VPC). There is no size limit, so it scales automatically based on need and offers a 50 MB per second throughput per TB of storage; customers can pay for up to 100MBps throughput. It starts at $0.30/GB/month. Azure, meanwhile offers Azure File Storage, which is similar in nature but has a capacity of 5TB per file and 500TB per account and it requires manual scaling. It offers a 60MBps throughput for reading files. Rightscale Google does not have a native file storage offering, but instead offers the open source FUSE adapter, which allows users to mount files from Google Cloud Storage buckets and converts them into a file system. Google claims this provides the highest throughput of the three providers with 180MBps on reads and 120MBps on writes. But, Adler said in his experience the FUSE adapter is not as well integrated into Google’s cloud platform compared to the other two offerings, leading to potentially frustrating user experiences with it. Adler also notes that AWS’s EFS does not have a native backup solution, while Azure does. AWS encourages EFS users to rely on third-party backup tools at this point. Azure and Google offer lower prices for their file storage systems compared to AWS: Azure is $0.80 per GB/month, and Google is $0.20, but Adler says those costs do not take into account any replication or transfer charges. While AWS’s base price may seem higher, when taking into account all that it factors in related to scaling, it could be a wash between the three providers. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Columnist Wesley Young's observations may help these brands improve their visibility. Wesley Young on April 24, 2017 at 1:52 pm More Many brands continue to be challenged by location-based search despite its importance to customer engagement and store visits. Consider these numbers to understand why brands need to make location a priority: 85 percent to 95 percent of consumer engagement with brands happens through location-based assets. Use of location in advertising provided up to a 27 percent lift in specific campaigns run by Wendy’s. Yet it is common for major brand stores to not show up in location-based searches. Alternately, some are outperformed in search results by other brands that are doing a better job managing their online location presence. Some brands are much more visible in location-based search than others Location and maps are practically synonymous. With Google controlling 95 percent of mobile search market share, Google Maps is critical to local search. Consider the dominance of two brands in a search for “fast food restaurants” in Google Maps (see below).  The search area was randomly selected; I picked a non-urban area northwest of Philadelphia. Twelve of 20 search results were from Wendy’s and Arby’s, with Wendy’s making up eight and Arby’s making up four search results. These two brands not only took the most spots, they also took the top results. The remaining eight search results were divided among five other brands: McDonald’s, Burger King, Dairy Queen, Popeye’s and Taco Bell. In a repeat of the test, Wendy’s and Arby’s actually increased their superior metrics, occupying 14 of 20 search results. The numbers suggest more than coincidence. They reveal intentional and strategic decisions by the two brands — especially considering that there are easily over 20 McDonald’s restaurants in the search area. Wendy’s and Arby’s occupy 12 to 14 of 20 search results. Location is especially important to spontaneous purchase decisions such as travel Location-based search is critical to restaurants, counter service and fast food establishments, where purchase decisions are usually spontaneous. David Kaplan at Geomarketing reports that location plays a “gargantuan role” in customer decisions to eat at Wendy’s. Brandon Rhoten, Wendy’s VP/head of advertising, digital/social media, stated, “When it comes to food, you need to know what’s near you. We’re not a ‘considered purchase’ at all. We’re one of those brands that has to catch you as you’re making a decision.” This is also true for other business categories, such as gas stations and hotels — especially those located along the roughly 47,000 miles of busy interstate highway in the US. As retail spending is down, travel spending is booming, and AAA reports that low gas prices are prompting 69 percent of vacationing families to take road trips. Hotel occupancy is at record levels since a 2009 low. Food and beverage sales have grown at double the rate of other retail spending, and for the first time, Americans spend more eating out than at grocery stores. I experienced firsthand the difference that good location search marketing can have while driving on America’s highways. My family took a trip to Big Bend National Park for spring break, a nine-hour drive from Dallas. Needless to say, we looked for gas and meal stops along the way. It was surprising to me the number of times my wife would be looking along the route on Google Maps for places to stop and was unable to locate many of the places that we would see driving by. For example, she’d see map results and say, “The next Subway is about 10 miles away, and there’s a Dairy Queen in six miles. I don’t see much before then.” Yet we’d pass two different Subway restaurants and many other fast food joints that advertised on highway signs. That experience prompted me to take a closer look at why major brand stores were not showing up in Google Map search results. Below, I examine four ways I found brands being hurt by poor location practices and how they can improve customer traffic with better marketing strategies. 1. Link to location-specific pages on individual store Google Maps listings In the above example, map results to the search query “fast food restaurants” found mostly Wendy’s and Arby’s stores. Both brands link to a location-specific page with address, maps and hours in the web page section of the Maps listing. Wendy’s uses locations.wendys.com and Arby’s uses locations.arbys.com. On the other hand, McDonald’s and Dairy Queen link to the general websites McDonalds.com or DairyQueen.com, where there are some promotions for the brand as a whole. Each site offers the ability to find nearby store locations by typing in a ZIP code or address and has location-specific pages, but these are not directly linked to a store’s specific Google Map listing. Burger King does link to a specific page, even though the website address is listed simply as bk.com. Perhaps a clearer URL that signals it provides location information to Google would perform better. On my trip, the worst-performing fast food restaurant was Subway. Even zoomed in on a small intersection in Google Maps, the store pin often appears as an orange circle instead of a red circle. For restaurants, only the red circles or dots appear in Google Maps’ list of search results. Subway links to a menu and online ordering page via order.subway.com.  While this alone may not account for the vast difference in Google Maps visibility, it seems an easy one to fix. Subway restaurant doesn’t appear in Google Map results for “fast food restaurant.” 2. Separate bundled retail outlets into individually located stores As we were driving through Baird, Texas, there appeared to only be one dining option: Dairy Queen. At least, that’s how it seemed based on Google Maps. Yet about 300 feet away from the Dairy Queen was a Love’s Travel Stop that had a Subway and Chester’s Fried Chicken located inside the store. Below is the profile picture of the Love’s Travel Stop that clearly shows signage for both fast food restaurants. However, they are virtually impossible to find searching on Google Maps. The Subway store doesn’t even appear in search results for the search term “Subway” in the area, let alone a search for fast food restaurants. The Subway and Chester’s inside Love’s Travel Stop do not appear in search results. In this case, separate Google listings should be created for all three stores: Loves, Subway and Chester’s. Google allows multiple storefronts to occupy an identical address. In creating unique Google listing pages, the most helpful differentiator appears to be a unique phone number for each listing. Other ways to distinguish and promote each business would be to link to unique (location-based, see #1 above) web pages, and if possible, add suite numbers. Make sure that other citations (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor, YellowPages.com) likewise distinguish the separate stores with those unique phone numbers, addresses and website/pages. 3. Double down on descriptions of services to cover multiple business categories The need for gas is a necessity that forces a stop on a road trip. But customers often refuel more than their cars, and gas stations depend on it. Gas has one of the lowest profit margins in retail, so the drinks and snacks that customers buy are often what supports the store. That explains the common partnership between gas station and convenience store. It also offers the opportunity to get two bites at the apple as customers may search for either keyword: “gas stations” or “convenience stores.” The problem is that gas stations commonly split the two business categories into their respective brands. So a search for gas stations would pull up a Shell, Alon or Exxon. A search for convenience stores pull up a 7-Eleven or Allsups. Yet a store may be more attractive if a customer who searches for gas stations can also see a nice convenience store like a 7-Eleven attached to it. The screen shots below show that 7-Eleven and Allsups convenience stores in Clyde, Texas, are not showing up in searches for gas stations. The blue markers indicate they are not a search result and only show up as a surrounding business when the map is zoomed in to an area smaller than a football field. Convenience stores 7-Eleven and Allsups do not appear in search results for gas stations. Stripes (a convenience store/gas station brand in the Southwest) seems to do a nice job being found regardless of what search term is used. It will often have two or even three pin drops per store — one for the gas station, one for the convenience store and even one for an ATM located on site. Every listing, even the ATM listing, will include a description that indicates it carries gas, snacks, drinks and sundries, and thus all listings appear on the map in searches for “gas station.” Increase the odds of being found, and make sure customers know all of your core products and services no matter which part of your business they locate, by providing a concise yet complete description of your business for each listing. 4. Location-based search ads appear to boost organic mobile map search results It makes more financial sense for businesses such as hotels to pay for search ads than it does for smaller transaction-based businesses like fast food restaurants or gas stations. And it seems to make a difference in organic search results on the Google Map app, too. A search for hotels around Sweetwater, Texas, pulled up a few major brand hotels, including a Holiday Inn Express, a La Quinta and a Best Western. All three purchased ads that show up on a desktop Google Maps search. A less visible Hampton Inn doesn’t show up on the map until it is zoomed in, and there is no indication it purchased any advertising. A search on a mobile device using the Google Maps app for hotels in the area pulls up a limited list of seven hotels, including the three brands that advertised. Hampton Inn doesn’t appear on the list or on the map. It only appears next to the Holiday Inn when I’m zoomed in as far as I can on the map, and the brown marker for the Hampton Inn indicates it is not included in the search result for “hotels.”  In other words, it is highly unlikely to be found in a search for hotels. Hampton Inn does not appear in search results for “hotels.” Hampton Inn’s lack of visibility is despite its having a higher Google reviews rating and a higher TripAdvisor rating, with more than double the number of reviews. Thus, if your business isn’t showing up on Google Map results, it may be worth trying some paid advertising to see if that will help. Final thoughts Even major national brands struggle with getting location marketing right all the time. The numbers show that strong location marketing can make a big difference in being found, driving traffic and boosting sales. Take a look and see whether any of these tips might help improve visibility on Google Maps in crowded and competitive search results. If you’re an agency working with brands, also make sure to get pre-campaign benchmarks that can help demonstrate the work you do is making that difference.

Moz report: 50% of page one search results are HTTPS Based on the trend of sites switching to HTTPS and what is ranking in Google, we may see 70% of the page one results going to HTTPS by the end of 2017. Barry Schwartz on April 24, 2017 at 10:11 am More Pete Meyers from Moz reports that according to their keyword tracking tools, half of the page one search results in Google show HTTPS URLs. This is up from 30 percent of the results in July 2016. And based on this trend, 70 percent of the page one search results could be HTTPS by the end of the year. Here is a chart from Moz showing the 50 percent mark, and then the estimated trend by the end of 2017: Pretty amazing, since Google started this push back in 2014 with their HTTPS ranking boost reward. Google just recently said they have no plans on boosting the HTTPS ranking signal, even though they actually thought about doing so a few months ago. Moz tracks 10,000-plus keywords in their toolset, so this is not a full study of all the queries that return HTTPS results. A similar tool by RankRanger also puts Google’s page one results at about 50 percent for HTTPS URLs. Peter Meyers digs deeper into which popular websites have switched and which have not.

The problem is that the people living in the place you’re visiting may speak a different language than you. Google is here to help. Starting today, local reviews in Google Maps and Google Search will be automatically translated into the language that you’ve set on your device. The original text of the review will be available below the translated version. Translating reviews manually has always been an option, but that can be kind of a pain because you’ve got to copy the text, switch to a translation app, paste the text in, and then wait for the translation to pop out. And then you’ve got the repeat the process for any other reviews that you’d like to read. Now Google is taking all of that work out and making your trips easier.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Louisville Metro taxpayers have spent nearly $165,000 so far on outside lawyers to defend a utility pole ordinance passed more than a year ago at the behest of Google Fiber despite few signs that the super-fast Internet service will be installed here anytime soon. On Tuesday, lawyers for the city and for telecommunications giant AT&T will square off in U.S. District Court in Louisville. The question: whether Metro government had the authority to enact a so-called “One Touch, Make Ready” ordinance in February 2016. The Louisville law allows for new telecommunications providers like Google Fiber to move and rearrange existing providers’ equipment on utility poles. In other words, Google Fiber contractors could rearrange the wires belonging to AT&T and cable company Charter Communications as they install Google’s equipment instead of waiting for AT&T and Charter to schedule their own crews to do the work. Louisville officials say the policy minimizes disruption on city streets and sidewalks as one crew can do the work instead of two or three. But AT&T and Charter worry about damage to their equipment and service outages. Judge David J. Hale of U.S. District Court in Louisville will preside over an oral argument scheduled for Tuesday morning as he prepares to rule on motions from AT&T and Metro government to decide the case. Google still “committed” to Louisville Google Fiber backs Louisville in the case, saying in a court filing Friday that it could “potentially” bring the ultra-fast Internet and TV service to Louisville. But Google Fiber hasn’t begun building its network here 19 months after announcing that Louisville had been added to its list of expansion cities. Last year, Google Fiber announced a “pause” in its plans for most of its expansion cities, though there has been no change in Louisville’s status as one of nine “potential” fiber cities. “We are excited to bring fiber to Louisville and are still figuring out the path,” Google Fiber said in October in a statement issued through Mayor Greg Fischer. Google Fiber reiterated that in a statement on Monday: "We remain committed to bringing Google Fiber to Louisville and are excited about the future. We’ve made great progress and we will have more details to share soon as we continue to work with the Mayor’s office to find innovative new ways to deploy superfast internet.”  Grace Simrall, the city’s chief of civic innovation, was traveling Monday and unavailable. "The city continues to work with Google to bring the service to the city," Chris Poynter, a spokesman for Fischer, said Monday. Councilman says ordinance is ‘good policy’ But regardless of whether Google Fiber enters the market, the utility pole ordinance is “good policy,” said Metro Council member Bill Hollander, who sponsored the measure. For example, Hollander said, the “one touch, make ready” approach reduces the number of crews working on poles when cellular providers string fiber that connects to cell towers. “We have more and more utilities working in our rights of way… We’ve got all kinds of fiber companies on our streets right now,” Hollander said. Through March 8, Louisville Metro had spent $127,252 on outside lawyers with telecommunications expertise to defend the ordinance’s legality in the AT&T lawsuit, according to Josh Abner, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Attorney’s Office. The city has spent another $37,534 on contract lawyers in a similar lawsuit brought by Charter Communications, the local cable provider, in September 2016. The county attorney’s office has hired Spiegel & McDiarmid, of Washington D.C., to defend both lawsuits. Abner said the funds come from Louisville Metro's annual allocation to the county attorney's office, which has multiple funding streams. In a decision dated March 30, U.S. District Judge Charles Simpson allowed Charter’s challenge to Louisville’s utility pole ordinance to continue, saying Metro government had not made a convincing argument that it should be dismissed at an early stage of the case. Google: ‘Incumbent’ providers stall to delay competition Louisville’s battle with AT&T has garnered national attention. Nashville – where Google Fiber is already in service – passed a similar ordinance last year, also drawing a lawsuit by AT&T. The Federal Communications Commission weighed in on Louisville’s behalf last fall, telling the judge that the city’s ordinance does not conflict the FCC’s pole-attachment regulations. Meanwhile, over the last two years AT&T has wired much of the Louisville-Southern Indiana area for its own AT&T Fiber service, which offers speeds on par with Google Fiber. In its brief filed last week, Google Fiber said Louisville’s ordinance allows for a “streamlined approach” that’s better for the community because it means faster network installation with fewer trucks blocking roads and sidewalks. Otherwise, Google Fiber argues, it has to rely on “incumbent” providers like AT&T and cable companies to have their own crews make way for Google Fiber on the poles. And those providers are “not always eager to complete work that will allow rival entrants to offer competitive services,” according to Google Fiber. In fact, it can take “months or even years” for Google Fiber to get access to a single utility pole because of delays in other providers moving their equipment, Google argues. Google Fiber said one unidentified “incumbent attacher” in one of its fiber cities takes an average of 81 days to move its equipment to make way for Google’s service. “When this occurs, the cumulative impact under the serial approach can be severe,” Google Fiber said. In a court filing last year, AT&T argued that Louisville’s ordinance illegally deprives the company of the right to make sure its equipment is not damaged and ensure “continuity and quality of service to its customers.” Reach reporter Chris Otts at 502-585-0822, cotts@wdrb.com, on Twitter or on Facebook.

"Our mission is to make the dream of personal flight a reality. We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them," said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google's home town of Mountain View, California. "Today we're announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017." The video showed the aircraft, with two pontoons and a spider web-like platform, taking off from a lake at an undisclosed location and hovering above the water, where it is meant to be used. The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 100 kilograms and fly at speeds up to 40km/h. The company describes The Flyer as "a new, all-electric aircraft," which is "safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas" under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot's licence is required, and two hours' training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Mr Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google's self-driving car, tweeted: "Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype." The company announced it was offering three-year "memberships" for $100 to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines.

Nintendo Switch The marquee feature of the Halo, made by Xiaomi-backed brand Yi, is its portability, weighing less than 8 pounds. There are 16 cameras arranged in a ring with a new ‘Up’ camera facing upward to better fully capture a scene. Shooting at 4K resolution, battery life is rated at 100 minutes of continuous recording. An Android app acts as a remote control and features a live preview tool, with the device also featuring a small screen with the status of each camera, battery life, and other stats. These rigs make heavy use of Google’s data centers to seamlessly stitch together artifact-free footage in a few hours. The Halo has been built to work natively with Jump Assembler. The Yi Halo will go on sale starting this summer for $16,999, with units already available for select creators. At the NAB 2017 convention in Las Vegas, Google announced the Jump Start program with the aim to get more 360 degree equipment out to creators. Filmmakers will be given free access to a rig and unlimited access to Jump Assembler for their projects and films. There are spaces for 100 creators with applications opening today and closing on May 22nd. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Machine learning and containers are two of the most exciting current examples, and we’ve added two special new events, TensorFlow Day and Infrastructure Boot Camp, that give OSCON attendees a great way to get right to work using these important new technologies,” says Rachel Roumeliotis, who chairs OSCON along with Microsoft’s Scott Hanselman and Google’s Kelsey Hightower. Designed and presented by Google’s Amy Unruh and Yufeng Gu, TensorFlow Day is an intense introduction to Google’s powerful, flexible, and popular open source library for machine learning. Kicking off with a keynote on the state and future of TensorFlow, the day includes lots of demos that show the incredible range and impact of machine and deep learning, powered by TensorFlow. Infrastructure Boot Camp is a four-day immersion in the key technologies of modern, cloud-based infrastructure containers, Docker, and Kubernetes. Software developers and devops engineers will learn how to deliver efficiency and innovation with continuous integration via the cloud from expert practitioners from Google, Cloudera, Netflix, Docker, and other leading companies. With over 25 workshops and hundreds of sessions across four days, OSCON is the one place that engineers and technology decision-makers can discover the latest tools and technologies, get in-depth training in crucial languages, frameworks, and best practices, and survey the entire range of open source applications. Registration remains open, and a limited number of media passes are available for qualified journalists and analysts. For more information or to request an interview, contact maureen@oreilly.com.

Multi-user voice recognition is rolling out to Google Home today Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 9:01am PDTApr 20, 2017 78 Plus 1 on G+ 138 Share on Facebook 97 Share on Twitter Total Shares313 Google News Videos Update 1: 2017/04/20 12:02pm PDT Here is the setup flow, courtesy of Artem Russakovskii: Bringing Google Assistant out of the phone and dropping it into Google Home comes with some difficulties. Not the least of which is, how do you handle personal account preferences and data when Google Home is available to everyone in the house? Until now the solution has been "don't." Starting today, you can register multiple users with your Google home, which recognizes them by voice. To set this up, look for a device card in the Home app that says"Multi-user is now available" or "Link your account." The setup process has you say the "OK Google" and "Hey Google" hotwords twice each. From then on, Google Home will be able to provide personal results because it knows who you are. The same is true for up to five other people in the house. The personal results affected by multi-user include My Day, calendars, flights, shopping lists, photos, and more. Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account. You can get started fiddling around with this today, but only in the US. Multi-user will roll out to the UK in the coming months.

Evolutionary at best. cusaitech Will this prevent ads from activating Google home? Jonathan Berry I believe unrecognized users will continue to work, just without the personalization it can do if it recognizes you. Shagnscooby I'm wondering if you can specify the default account if it's an unrecognized person. The biggest reason I've been looking forward to this is because of someone in my house using the Google Home for music with GPM and me in the car listening and it stops playing because of simultaneous streams. I'd probably specify one of my kids as the default account so it never overlaps my listening. Kakairo Yes! Can't wait to set this up when I get home. Hopefully adding calendar events and reminders isn't far behind. Carson Saldanha Roll out... :( Kakairo I've been lucky with roll outs lately, hopefully that streak continues. surethom UK coming month not good. Will this FINALLY let us ask for my music uploaded by artist name & song to play without a subscription? DzMn Can I pick your brains if you have a Google Home surethom? I was thinking about getting one of these but I'm not exactly sure what the thing can currently do in the UK. My two main uses would be: 1) Play music, this is my main thing. I use GPM but do not have a subscription, I usually just play music from the MicroSD Card in my phone, but was thinking of uploading my whole collection to GPM so I can access it online. I take it from your comment above, it's not possible to play any music unless you have a GPM subscription, is that correct? 2) Set Alarms and Calendar entries. Can you do either of these yet or are they not available? surethom Hi no problem. Yes I don't have any subscriptions just uploaded my 10,000 songs. You can ask ok google play my music, & it will start playing randomly, you can create Playlists, Ok google play my morning Playlists. But you Cannot say ok google play michael jackson thriller or ok google play music by coldnplay. It still cannot add to calendar but I think you can set alarms I'm not sure on the top of my head. Also the Google home has a very high bass level, I prefer a lower bass. I have created a few YouTube clips. https://youtu.be/16hS84ZJrDc DzMn Thanks for the detailed info, I appreciate it :) Hmmm, I might wait a bit then to see if they update it. I do often want to play just a specific artist, so that would be a bit annoying in its current state if it can't do that. Same goes with the Calendar, I always have lots in my calendar and it would be nice to add entries rather than just read current ones. Thanks again for getting back with what it can and can't do, I think I'll hang on for a bit and see if/when they add this stuff. If they do I'd certainly be interested. Cheers Defenestratus Thank goodness. I'm really sick of having my wife's terrible music selections showing up as recommendations in GPM. MrCalifornia If my wife doesn't have her own Google Music subscription can she not play music on Google Home anymore? Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time... This is how i started !wr241c: ➽➽ ➽➽➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs241BuzzGlobal/GetPaid$97/Hour... ★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫:::!wr241u:..... Chad Cardwell I have the same question/concern, though I think it may have been answered in the article when he said: "Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account." Nicholas Conrad Sign up for that family plan son. surethom So each person has to upload all there music to each account for Playlists to work? Or can you ask for any Playlists from somone else's music uploaded? Still Google. Does not explain properly. trickytree1984 Same question Rob Also wondering Scott Olsen I'm guessing I still won't be able to link my work account to my personal account so that I can get both calendar events when I ask about my day. M. Luciano Not without sharing your calendar to the other account. F4LL0U7 My IT department blocks sharing our work calendars externally. gSyncit is the only thing that worked for me, and it works great. I love getting my work meeting agenda & reminders on my personal phone & watch. Check it out. http://www.fieldstonsoftware.com/software/gsyncit4/ lgg4 On this note, whats the best way to manage a gapps vs gmail account? I have my calendar, google drive and play store apps all on my gapps acocunt, but gplay music and non-business stuff on my gmail. Shoudl i try to transfer everything over to my consumer gmail account and just share my biz calendar to personal? I ask this as features seem to be limited at times with gapps accounts and when i linked my gapps with Home (due to my calendar), it says it cannot access my agenda. David Hyman Will this allow me to use my Spotify account on my phone while my wife uses hers on our Google home? jonzey231 As long as she specifies her Spotify account under her profile, I wouldn't see why not. David Hyman If that's the case it would solve such a first world problem for us! Let's hope that's how it works jonzey231 My brother is adding my Fiancee and I to his GPM family plan right now so we can take advantage of this. Previously, we had a $10/mo GPM sub using a shared gmail account. jonzey231 Will be doing this as soon as I get home from work. dcdttu OMG adorable gay couple in ad because Google wants me to buy 1 of these for every square foot of my house. <3 morteum IS THAT THE PIXEL 2???

Ge tout of here keithzg *checks Canadian Google Store, sighs heavily, slowly walks away with head down* thunderqus That ad with gay couple made me smile :) MJ OK Google, now give us the ability to add reminders and calendar appts! Leonardo Baez I would put a gif of "It's happening" ... but it is no politically correct anymore VAVAMk_2 Why not? Nicholas Conrad "it" is a pejorative pronoun. You should say 'they's happening' now. DaveH Ok, now what features have they removed? Morten Ulv My 6P is over two years old and I have both the battery and the bootloop issue. Luckily, in my Norway, phones (and most electronics) have by law a 5 year "extended warranty" (from the seller, not the manufacturer) to protect consumers from issues like this. NexusPhan You're posting on the wrong article. Also, no your 6P is not over two years old as it wasn't released two years ago. Morten Ulv Guess I fucked that up. I bought it used, and my reciept is from march 2015, so that's why. Maybe the preorder date or an error. benjammin03 What does it do with an unrecognized voice? Does it default to a primary account? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google Home Problems With Multi-User Voice, Google Is Looking Into It" Story to be published in 5... 4... 3... Bill Van I can't wait to see if this multi-user update will work with my twin brother. Our voices are so close that we have always had a tough time trying to figure out who is speaking during many recording. I guess I'll find out later this evening but for now my fingers are crossed..... rslh This would be interesting to know. Google is smart, but not sure if it's THAT smart! I would think assigning different hot words for each user would be ideal, but what do I know. Rob I agree trickytree1984 So why the UK delay? Why can i ask my phone for my agenda from my exchange calendar but not my home? Will my wife still be able to use my GPM subscription? Deeco US only, In the coming months, End of Q4, Rolling out in a couple weeks... We are tired of this shit Google!!! Shai Pal Anyone succeeded in doing this outside of U.S? Morten Ulv One should think that it's language (US vs UK) restricted and not location, though from their wording, it seems to be location based. I want to import one soon, so hopefully I'll be able to use these features and not having to wait. Shai Pal My setup is US english and a US google account. Nothing here... Murray I'm in Aus with my Google Home and phone set to English US - still no multi-user Jonathan Michienzi Nothing for me yet either. Us English language on my original Google home account and the one I want to add. I'm in Canada selonmoi Me in November: "Well, at least it'll probably be available in Canada by the time they get multi-user voice recognition working." Me now: _(ツ)_/¯ whispy_snippet Now Google, please fix voice unlock on the Pixel because it works roughly 50% of the time. xuohtx Wait? Separate shopping lists now? froemer I wonder if multi-user would also make it so that my kids can't adjust the thermostat or mess with the lights? JG OK, now that we have multi-user support... Can we have multi-Home support as well? If I'm in the living room, I only want the living room Home to respond, I don't need the one in my bedroom rattling off information as well.

Will this FINALLY let us ask for my music uploaded by artist name & song to play without a subscription? DzMn Can I pick your brains if you have a Google Home surethom? I was thinking about getting one of these but I'm not exactly sure what the thing can currently do in the UK. My two main uses would be: 1) Play music, this is my main thing. I use GPM but do not have a subscription, I usually just play music from the MicroSD Card in my phone, but was thinking of uploading my whole collection to GPM so I can access it online. I take it from your comment above, it's not possible to play any music unless you have a GPM subscription, is that correct? 2) Set Alarms and Calendar entries. Can you do either of these yet or are they not available? surethom Hi no problem. Yes I don't have any subscriptions just uploaded my 10,000 songs. You can ask ok google play my music, & it will start playing randomly, you can create Playlists, Ok google play my morning Playlists. But you Cannot say ok google play michael jackson thriller or ok google play music by coldnplay. It still cannot add to calendar but I think you can set alarms I'm not sure on the top of my head. Also the Google home has a very high bass level, I prefer a lower bass. I have created a few YouTube clips. https://youtu.be/16hS84ZJrDc DzMn Thanks for the detailed info, I appreciate it :) Hmmm, I might wait a bit then to see if they update it. I do often want to play just a specific artist, so that would be a bit annoying in its current state if it can't do that. Same goes with the Calendar, I always have lots in my calendar and it would be nice to add entries rather than just read current ones. Thanks again for getting back with what it can and can't do, I think I'll hang on for a bit and see if/when they add this stuff. If they do I'd certainly be interested. Cheers Defenestratus Thank goodness. I'm really sick of having my wife's terrible music selections showing up as recommendations in GPM. MrCalifornia If my wife doesn't have her own Google Music subscription can she not play music on Google Home anymore?

Chad Cardwell I have the same question/concern, though I think it may have been answered in the article when he said: "Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services.

Nicholas Conrad Sign up for that family plan son. surethom So each person has to upload all there music to each account for Playlists to work? Or can you ask for any Playlists from somone else's music uploaded? Still Google. Does not explain properly. trickytree1984 Same question Rob Also wondering Scott Olsen I'm guessing I still won't be able to link my work account to my personal account so that I can get both calendar events when I ask about my day. M. Luciano Not without sharing your calendar to the other account.

You needed root to stop the battery from being dead by 4 PM 5 Advanced Ways to Improve Battery Life on Android 5 Advanced Ways to Improve Battery Life on Android If you've got a rooted Android device (or you're willing to root it), and you want better battery life, we can help you out. Read More . You needed it to remove the ridiculous bloatware added by carriers. And you needed it to replace the horrible user interface that the manufacturer had developed. But with the improvements to Android in the last few years, and the less garish and bloated stock ROMs designed by the phone makers, do you still need to root your device? Reasons to Root an Android Device From performance enhancements to security updates, there are a lot of good reasons why rooting and modding Android is worthwhile. Custom ROMs and OS Updates The ability to install custom ROMs How to Install a Custom ROM on Your Android Device How to Install a Custom ROM on Your Android Device Ready to revitalize your Android phone or tablet? Installing a custom ROM is the best way to do that -- powering it up with even better performance and features. Read More remains the biggest draw for modding and hacking Android. Technically, you don’t need root to do this — you just need an unlocked bootloader and custom recovery — but the two tend to go hand in hand. Being rooted enables you to use a flashing app like FlashFire or ROM Manager, and custom ROMs very often come pre-rooted themselves. In the past, using a custom ROM was essential for enthusiasts to fill the gaps in the Android operating system and to replace the ugly, bloated interfaces that manufacturers would use on their devices. These days Android is very polished, and most stock ROMs are far less offensive than they were. That said, a custom ROM still represents the best — and often the only — way many users will be able to use the latest version of Android. Smartphone manufacturers have a dreadful record for updating their devices, and it’s showing no sign of improvement. Six months after the launch of Nougat, less than 5 percent of devices are running it. One in five devices are still using KitKat from late-2013. Even worse, many of these unsupported devices don’t get the latest security updates either, leaving them vulnerable to attack. The best ROMs, including the CyanogenMod replacement Lineage OS LineageOS Replaces CyanogenMod: How to Try It on Android Right Now LineageOS Replaces CyanogenMod: How to Try It on Android Right Now CyanogenMod was shut down at the end of 2016, but its successor LineageOS is now available to try.

Remove Bloatware No matter how much it bugs users, manufacturers and carriers continue to install extra apps onto their phones. You can’t uninstall this so-called bloatware, although Android does now have a Disable feature that removes them from the app launcher and prevents them from running. Not every app has a Disable option, though, or maybe you’d just prefer to remove them entirely. In this case, a rooted phone with Titanium Backup installed would be able to do the job. And then there’s the ultimate step in anti-bloat: ditching Google itself. Removing Google apps and disconnecting Here's How You Can Use Android But Ditch Google Here's How You Can Use Android But Ditch Google Want to use your Android smartphone or tablet without Google?

Because We Can Finally, we have to acknowledge that many of us root our phones just because we can. Maybe we like the extra control we get from it, want to test the limits of the hardware by installing a custom kernel, or just like to try something different. If this is you, and unlocking the bootloader is the first thing you do when you unbox a new phone, then the next section won’t matter at all. Why You Shouldn’t Root an Android Device Like it or not, there are risks associated with rooting 4 Security Reasons Why You Should Never Root Your Android 4 Security Reasons Why You Should Never Root Your Android Rooting Android -- like jailbreaking iPhone -- brings with it some great function benefits. But there's a down side: what risks do you face by rooting your Android device? Read More . The process opens up access to parts of the system that are normally blocked for security reasons. As a result, a badly-coded app can brick your phone. A maliciously coded app can do even worse. As good as custom ROMs, root apps, and Xposed modules are, you need to be sure you trust them before you let them loose on your rooted device. It’s Getting Harder to Do Perhaps as a result of the risks, a lot manufacturers and carriers are making efforts to lock down their devices. There’s a trend for U.S. carriers to ship their devices with bootloaders that cannot be unlocked Every Android User Should Tweak These 10 Developer Options Every Android User Should Tweak These 10 Developer Options Android's Developer Options menu houses a lot of tools for those writing apps, but you can get something out of it, too. Here are the most useful settings hiding in the Developer Options. Read More . The Galaxy S7 was an example of this. You could still root the phone, but you couldn’t use custom ROMs. It’s likely to be the same story for the S8, and the LG G6 is heading in the same direction. You’ll Have App Problems Equally, you can lose app compatibility. Android has a feature called SafetyNet that determines whether a device has been rooted or had its bootloader unlocked. Developers can use SafetyNet and decide whether to prevent their apps from working on devices they deem insecure. Many banking and other financial apps won’t work on rooted phones, along with Pokemon Go and Mario Run Super Mario Run Is Now Available on Android Super Mario Run Is Now Available on Android Super Mario Run has been available on iOS for a while, but now, finally, it has arrived on Android. Read More . Android Pay doesn’t work where the bootloader has been unlocked. As always, there’s a workaround. The Magisk mod roots your phone and includes an app that allows you to hide it from SafetyNet. As rooting and modding becomes more difficult, and you need to find more workarounds, the process becomes more complex. You could reach a point where the inconveniences of rooting start to outweigh the benefits. And you even risk a greater chance of bricking your phone. Warranty Issues How does rooting affect your warranty? The simple answer is that unrelated problems shouldn’t affect the warranty at all. So if your USB port comes loose, then your claim shouldn’t be rejected just because you’re running a custom ROM. But the warranty won’t cover software problems. Brick your phone when trying to install or use a particular mod, and you’ll need to fix it yourself. And remember that mods can also cause hardware problems. If your phone reboots every time you launch the camera, it may be your custom kernel to blame. Either way, it’s always a good idea to return to stock before making a warranty claim, although some devices permanently record when they’ve had their bootloader unlocked. Is Android Good Enough Without Rooting? We’ve looked at some of the pros and cons, and there are good reasons on both sides. But perhaps the best reason to not root is that Android is now good enough without it. Android used to be very rough around the edges, and rooting felt like a necessity. But in the last three years or so, the operating system has been refined in every way. The redesigned user interface, built around Material Design, gave Android a beautiful new look in Lollipop in 2014. The power management system called Doze debuted in Marshmallow in 2015 and brought improved battery life. Granular control over app permissions came with Nougat in 2016.

But you can get the best features on your phone or tablet without upgrading. Read More over apps running in the background. Many of the best reasons to root are being systematically dealt with, except one: Android’s slow update process. Because to take advantage of those new features without rooting, you need a phone that will receive updates to Nougat, O, and beyond. And that’s one problem that Google shows no sign of being able to solve. Do you still root and use custom ROMs on your phone? Is an unlockable bootloader a priority when you buy a new device?

Reply Doc April 24, 2017 at 5:58 pm Yes, I do need root. I can't do a thorough job backing up an Android phone or tablet without it (Titanium Backup is well worth the money!), and I can't copy files to SD card (under Android 4.x) with a file manager (like Astro); Google stupidly decided to make SD cards second-class citizens in ICS.

As far as I know, that limitation with SD card no longer applies. I rooted my previous device (LG G3) mainly because of the bloatwares and the awful stock ROM, but now I don't feel the need anymore.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Bid Goodbye to Parking Woes with This Nifty New Feature Coming to Google Maps By Zara Ali 14 hours ago 14Shares Share Tweet Submit The best thing about Google is that it keeps working on improving its services by introducing nifty features. Especially for Google Maps, the tech giant is continually awarding it new features that make our lives easier. Keeping up with its habit, Google would soon roll out an on-site parking search feature that would end your parking woes. Last month, Google Maps got a parking related feature that primarily focussed on reminding you where your car is parked and how much time is left for the parking meter to go off. Now, an upcoming parking feature would enlighten you about the on-site parking facility at your destination. It will let you plan in advance if the destination’s on-site parking is paid or free. A report by Android Police states that Google Maps 9.51 beta version has the feature, which means that Google might roll it out in a universal update. Related How to Download Locations on Google Maps for Offline Usage For all those wondering how it will work, here’s the information – the new feature appears under the “details” option of Google Maps when you select a destination, under the address, you will see the information regarding the on-site parking at your destination. If the parking is free, it will indicate “free,” and for paid it will show “paid,” but without displaying the actual cost. Advertisement Photo Credit: Android Police In addition, there is also an “On-site” indicator that shows the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Limited, and On-site) of the parking facility at your destination. This information appears next to time and distance details on the map. All this means that when you enter your destination, the new feature will only tell you whether there is an on-site free or paid parking. It will not inform you whether the parking is full or vacant. However, you can work your way around by typing the nearest destination and looking up for an on-site parking there. Related Google Play Awards 2017 Nominees Announced, Check out the Best of Play Store The report by Android Police also states that Google is going to make the feature even niftier by introducing additional features. One such feature would let users plan their trip around parking spots near their destination. This feature would scan the nearby parking lots around your destination and let you choose one; it will then show you the walking duration from the car park to your destination. We think that this feature would work well for famous spots around the city. What’s your take on this new feature? Do you think it will end your parking woes?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile All Pixel 2 Models Codenamed Walleye, Muskie, and Taimen to Feature Snapdragon 835, According to Google AOSP Code By Omar Sohail 13 hours ago 10Shares Share Tweet Submit The new Pixel series which are currently known to us as Pixel 2 have been rumored to be released in a total of three models. Details are quite scarce to be honest, except for the fact that these devices have been codenamed Walleye, Muskie, and Taimen. While their internals would definitely spark a debate, particularly which one of them would be sporting a Snapdragon 835, a Google AOSP code reveals some extremely interesting revelations about the three devices. AOSP Code Reveals That All Pixel 2 Codename Models Could Be Running a Snapdragon 835 Paying attention to the AOSP code, we see that codenames Walleye, Muskie, and Taimen are present there. Initially, it was believed that Walleye, and Muskie would be a part of the Pixel 2 lineup that was exclusively going to be delivered by Google in collaboration with HTC. Later on, a phone featuring the codename Taimen was also revealed, along with rumors disseminating in several directions that both Google and HTC will be working on a cost-effective Pixel variant. Related Google Could Release a Third Phone This Year – Rumored to Be Bigger Than Pixel XL Things might not be looking too optimistic for future consumers as it looks like all three versions will be running a Snapdragon 835 (via WinFuture). However, after looking at the internals Xiaomi’s Mi6 features it is more than possible for smartphone manufacturers to provide affordable Snapdragon 835-powered devices at lowered prices but that will result in extremely thin margins for these companies. Advertisement After looking at the Pixel and Pixel XL, we do not believe that HTC or Google are ready to embrace the low cost/more sales volumes/lower margins business model which is why we are under the impression that future devices will also carry a premium, but steeper price tag. However, this time we could be seeing support for wireless charging, hardware stabilization for cameras and a much better design as opposed to its predecessor.

While it does not appear that Unroll.Me really sold any personal data to Uber, the angry mob has spoken. If you’re going to sell user data to 3rd-party companies, you need to make that clear in the user agreement nobody reads anyway! The folks at Unroll.Me offer a fairly valuable service for users of email – basically everyone on earth. They organize emails that come from subscriptions into a single list. Instead of seeing a dozen emails each day, a user might only see one. In that one email, The Rollup, I might see briefings on what’s happened on Facebook, and SlashGear, and Pinterest. When I sign up for Unroll.Me, I do so with my Google Account. When I do this, I give permission for Unroll.Me to access my data. To attain The Rollup, I must allow Unroll to see my emails. Not necessarily humans, but software – software that organizes my email into a single list. Unroll (or Unroll.Me, if you prefer) is a “free” service, which means that whatever you’re doing with or contributing to their service is, in turn, being monetized. According to the CEO of Unroll, Jojo Hedaya, “it was heartbreaking to see that some of our users were upset to learn about how we monetize our free service.” He continued, “while we try our best to be open about our business model, recent customer feedback tells me we weren’t explicit enough.” What they sold was anonymous, said Hedaya, and all data sold to Uber was “related to purchases only.” Whenever I get an email congratulating me for purchasing a bag of cookies from Amazon, Unroll would know about it, and probably told Uber that “somebody bought a bag of cookies from Amazon.” Cut them all off While it is not quite as easy on most other services, Google makes cutting off app permissions easy. All I need to do is head over to Google Account Permissions with a web browser in which I am logged in with my Google Account of choice. If I can see my Gmail in a web browser, I’m logged in. OH GOD: Why is Pokemon GO on this list? Inside this Permissions panel I’ll see a list of apps – likely a list of apps that’s a real mixed bag. Some of these apps I recognize and use regularly. Other apps I don’t remember signing up for at all. This page shows app permissions for every app I have connected to Google, and have thereby given access to my Google Account. This is not a list of evil apps. I use several of these apps and I know what they’re capable of. Some of these apps access my Google Calendar to schedule events. An app like DocHub, for example, has access to my Google Drive so it can access files for me to sign inside Gmail. Each bit of access is listed on the right of the list. If I want to remove access to any one of these services or want to know more, I tap the name of that service. Inside is a slightly more detailed list of what the app has access to. Also inside is the date I authorized the app as well as a REMOVE button. It’s a good idea to remove access to most apps every once in a while. Each app will simply ask for permission to gain access again, should I use it. Removing access every once in a while through this Permissions Panel can potentially deter malicious accounts that’ve somehow gotten access to my account without my knowledge. Removing a service from this list means it’ll need to ask for permission again if it wants to gain access. Wrap-up It’s debatable whether Unroll.Me deserves to be forgiven for selling data to Uber. What’s not debatable is how all users need to remain vigilant when it comes to data theft. Cutting all services off from Google Services every once in a while is just one step. Also have a peek at a feature from last year that remains extremely relevant today: It’s not paranoia to cover your laptop’s webcam.

Image Credit: 20th Century Fox I’m very excited about the trio of technology and entertainment visionaries that are the latest speakers for our upcoming GamesBeat Summit 2017: How games, sci-fi, and tech create real-world magic. They include John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Labs and co-creator of Pokémon Go; Ralph Osterhout, CEO of Osterhout Design Group, maker of augmented reality glasses; and John Underkoffler, CEO of Oblong Industries, maker of the Mezzanine collaboration software and science advisor for the film Minority Report. GamesBeat Summit 2017 will take place on May 1-2 at the historic Claremont resort hotel in Berkeley, Calif., just a short distance from San Francisco. You can secure your seat here. Register today and receive 20 percent off current ticket prices. Use the code Deantak. I will moderate the session on the future of augmented reality, games, and new technologies. Our visionaries will have a conversation across the seams of science fiction, real-world technology, and games. Above: John Underkoffler, CEO of Oblong Industries, was science advisor on Minority Report. Image Credit: Oblong Industries Underkoffler has been trying to make the vision of the 2002 film Minority Report, where actor Tom Cruise uses “data gloves” and gestures to control a transparent computer, into a reality. He founded Oblong in 2006, and launched Mezzanine for enterprise collaborators in 2012. Oblong’s technological and design trajectories build on fifteen years of foundational work at the MIT Media Lab, where Underkoffler was responsible for innovations in real-time computer graphics systems, optical and electronic holography, large-scale visualization techniques, and the I/O Bulb and Luminous Room systems. He has also been science advisor to films including The Hulk, Aeon Flux, and Iron Man. He serves on the National Advisory Council of Cranbrook Academy in Bloomfield Hills, MI, and on the Board of Directors of the E14 Fund in Cambridge, Mass., and of the Sequoyah School in Pasadena, Calif. He is the recipient of the 2015 Cooper Hewitt National Design Award and holds a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Underkoffler will also be giving a solo talk at our summit on May 1. Above: John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Labs. Image Credit: Niantic Hanke has been running Niantic and riding the rocket ship of Pokémon Go, which has more than 65 million monthly active users and has generated more than $1 billion in revenue in less than a year. His company is dedicated to building “real world” mobile gaming experiences that foster exploration, exercise and social interaction. Niantic has developed and released two games, Ingress and global phenomenon Pokémon Go. The company was originally founded as a start up within Google to explore the creation of new kinds of entertainment at the intersection of location, social, and emerging mobile devices. Niantic was spun out as an independent company in 2015 with backing from investors such as Google, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. Earlier in his career, John was a founder of Archetype Interactive, creators of one of the very first online massively multiplayer games, Meridian59, and then went on to co-found Keyhole, a company acquired by Google for the technology that lead to the creation of Google Earth. He was vice president of Google’s Geo division (overseeing projects including Maps and Street View) for seven years before founding Niantic. Above: Ralph Osterhout, CEO of Osterhout Design Group Image Credit: ODG Osterhout is a developer, designer and entrepreneur. In his career, he has developed over 2,000 different products and hundreds of separate product lines for companies ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500s, as well as the government. He founded ODG in 1999, after several decades founding, building and selling companies in consumer products, sporting goods, defense contracting, personal electronics and high tech toys. Ralph has over 250 US patents and applications to his name and more than two decades working with head-worn displays. He was the designer of the PVS7 Night Vision Goggles and heads-up displays in scuba masks.

Who hasn’t been influenced by great novels like Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, which gave us virtual worlds, or Tom Cruise’s data gloves and gesture-controlled computer in Minority Report? Now those things have become real, and we want to see what’s coming next. Our theme is about what inspires game developers, executives, and investors to be creative. Part of the event will focus on the inspiration cycle that is accelerating as the walls between science fiction, video games, and real-world technology come down. We don’t think there’s another conference that focuses on the seams between these industries. This event will focus on inspiration and creativity. So much of what used to be science fiction is coming true, and it is inspiring even more accelerated visions of the future in games and other entertainment. We hope to inspire you by taking you to the moments that led to great ideas across multiple industries. You’ll leave refreshed and ready to change the worlds of gaming, technology, and more. We think this conference will offer a rare chance for cross-pollination and networking between high-level people in different industries, and we believe that insights in one place can lead to inspirations in another. This conference is for high-end gaming executives, startup CEOs, developers, investors, publishers, marketers, tech experts, entertainment industry professionals, sci-fi experts, AR and VR executives, and other professionals. I should also point out that this is where we try to create an actual GamesBeat community with our supporters, readers, and attendees. We gather the right people in the room and encourage everyone to get to know each other. Join us. If you’re interested in sponsoring, message andie.rhyins@venturebeat.com.

Everyone can use an Echo Dot: Just $50! Just open Google Maps or Search, search for what you’re interested in and the reviews are automatically translated. Most people will see the translated review in the language they prefer and then see the review in the native language below—eliminating the hassle of copying and pasting into a translation app or trying to decipher reviews using your pocket-sized translation book. It’s pretty simple. Now, when you’re traveling overseas and checking out reviews for that bar or restaurant of interest, you’ll now be able to read (roughly translated, as usual) reviews in your own language without any extra trouble. I’m actually surprised this wasn’t already a feature; somehow I’ve managed to travel internationally many times and not notice this inconvenience. I guess it’s there now, though, so I’ll just have to live with never knowing what it was like to copy/paste reviews in another language.

Back in March, it secured the FAA licenses mandatory to test two new prototypes. Kitty Hawk’s new aircraft’s – N401QZ and N402QZ – are electric and are classified are rotorcraft, meaning they include rotor blades. Larry Page-backed Kitty Hawk aims at creating all-electric, usable flying cars. The flying car startup is led by CEO and former Google self-driving head Sebastian Thrun, who wants to begin selling the personal aircraft by the end of the year. Two years ago, Thrun recruited Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, two aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spin-off company that won a competition for a human-powered helicopter and set a land speed record for a bicycle in 2016. Larry Page's Flying Car Kity Hawk Flyer (Image Credit: Kitty Hawk) As per a New York Times report, Kitty Hawk ran a test pilot at a lake about 100 miles north of San Francisco. NYT says the Kitty Hawk Flyer looks like something “Luke Skywalker would have built out of spare parts.” The flying car is an open-seated, 220-pound vehicle, powered by eight rotors that squall like a speedboat. Kitty Hawk says the flying car is “safe, tested and legal to operate in the US", as long as you fly it in "uncongested areas." The first Kitty Hawk Flyer prototype is designed to fly over water, which explains why it resembles a jet-ski. In the video (below) you can see tester Cimeron Morrissey fly it over a lake in California, gliding roughly 10 meters above the water surface. The flying car startup hasn’t divulged details such as the vehicle’s price tag, but we’re guessing it will be in the six-figure range. However, it is offering an early-bird discount of $2,000 for people who’re willing to shell out $100 now. According to the NYT, the early payment will help you bag both the discount as well as test flights with the Kitty Hawk. The aircraft is designed for hobbyist and recreational use. But, the flying car startup has a different goal in mind. It aims to make flying cars a practical reality as a means to reduce urban traffic congestion. This doesn’t mean that Kitty Hawk is a pioneer in this field. As a matter of fact, it could face fierce competition from half a dozen flying car bigwigs, including Airbus, headquartered in Blagnac, France. Some less known startups include Terrafugia, Volocopter, and ParaJet. The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of the several prototypes the Larry Page-backed company is designing. Thrun, in an interview with the NYT, said the startup has been in contact with the FAA. He agrees that while the concerns over flying vehicles are legitimate, we would need to have to work together in order to understand how new technologies will shape the future of the society.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad 'Personal flying machine' maker plans deliveries this year By Afp Published: 13:01 EDT, 24 April 2017 | Updated: 17:12 EDT, 24 April 2017 e-mail No license needed in the US for the all-electric "personal flying machine," as long as it's used in uncongested areas. The final design will look different to this prototype. A Silicon Valley "flying car" startup, Kitty Hawk, reportedly backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, released a video Monday of its airborne prototype and announced plans for deliveries of a "personal flying machine" this year. "Our mission is to make the dream of personal flight a reality. We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them," said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google's home town of Mountain View, California. "Today we're announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017." The video showed the single-seat aircraft -- with two pontoons and a spider web-like platform -- taking off from a lake at an undisclosed location and hovering above the water, where it is meant to be used. The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and fly at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (40 kph). and can hover at 15 feet (4.5 meters) high. The company describes the Flyer as "a new, all-electric aircraft," which is "safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas" under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot's license is required, and two hours' training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google's self-driving car, tweeted: "Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype." The company announced it was offering three-year "memberships" for $100 to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. - Limited details - The startup offered only limited details about the company. An email response to an AFP query said the lead engineers were Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, who created a startup called Aerovelo which aims to produce the fastest human-powered vehicle. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. A blog post by writer Cimeron Morrissey, who took the flyer for a test run, offered some clues on how it feels. "The prototype looks and feels a lot like a flying motorcycle. You mount the seat and lean forward, just like you would on a bike," she wrote. "I feel light and ecstatic and utterly free. This is just like my flying dreams!" Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines.

Called 'Copyless Paste', the upgrade takes data from your Chrome uses it to improve the experience in other apps.

Users can activate it in chrome://flags in Chrome Canary for Android, but it may not work properly just yet.  But the feature does have some restrictions. It won't work with Incognito Mode on Chrome and it doesn't appear to operate on lower-end Android smartphones. VentureBeat noted that the feature will most-likely hit Chrome 60 in the next few months for Android users, but it could also be more widely available in Android O when it is released. The new features was first reported on by VentureBeat, which stated 'Google has deployed the first code' for a feature set to kill copy/paste. Advanced users can get an early look at the feature by editing files in Chrome Canary for Android, a test version of the software Google uses to try out new features, but it may not work properly just yet. The description, however, shares with users about how it could work in the future. 'If you looked at a restaurant website and switched to the Maps app, the keyboard would offer the name of that restaurant as a suggestion to enter into the search bar,' reads the code's description in the Chrome for Android Canary build. And it shared that any of the data gathered is stored locally and never shared with Google. It seems that the tech giant began developing Copyless Past in February and commuted the code just last week. VentureBeat noted that the feature will most-likely hit Chrome 60 in the next few months for Android users, but it could also be more widely available in Android O when it is released.

The feature will most-likely hit Chrome 60 in the next few months for Android users, but it could also be more widely available in Android O when it is released. It won't work with Incognito Mode on Chrome and doesn't appear to operate on lower-end Android smartphones Using the new Microsoft Authenticator account app, users type in their username for a Microsoft account and will receive a sign-in alert on their smartphone that they approve or deny.  'With phone sign-in, we're shifting the security burden from your memory to your device,' Microsoft director Alex Simons wrote in a blog post. 'Just add your account to the Android or iOS Microsoft Authenticator app, then enter your username as usual when signing in somewhere new. Instead of entering your password, you'll get a notification on your phone.' While Google is set to kill copy/paste, Microsoft is out to dump the password – the firm revealed an alternative method for accessing accounts that is deemed easier than the two-step verification and more secure than typing in a code  'Unlock your phone, tap 'Approve', and you're in.' Simons also explained that the process is easier than the standard two-step verification and more secure than typing in a password – as they are easily compromised or forgotten. 'Using your phone to sign in with PIN or fingerprint is a seamless way to incorporate two account 'proofs' in a way that feels natural and familiar,' he shared. The new method only works for websites that need your Microsoft Account information such as Skype, Outlook and OneDrive To use the new method, download and install Microsoft Authenticator app from the App Store and Google Play and then add your Microsoft account to the app. Then log into a website on a desktop that needs your Microsoft Account information and you should receive a notification on your smartphone after you type in your username. The new method only works for websites that need your Microsoft Account information such as Skype, Outlook and OneDrive.  CHOOSING A SECURE PASSWORD Avoid favorite sports. 'Baseball' and 'football' were often in the top 10 worst password list. Birthdays and years of birth are easy to guess with the help of personal information. Common names such as Michael and Jennifer are insecure, with many making SplashData's Top 50 list, too. Experts suggest using eight mixed types of characters, with seemingly random combinations if possible. They say that passphrases – short words with spaces or other characters separating them – are easy to recall and are relatively secure if seemingly random words are used. Experts also advise having different passwords for different sites, instead of relying on one, which if hacked, could prove particularly serious.    Read more: Google is testing Copyless Paste in Chrome for Android, gives text suggestions in other apps | VentureBeat | Mobile | by Jordan Novet Share or comment on this article e-mail 5 shares Most watched News videos Schoolboy, 14, fends off angry adult using martial arts New video shows aftermath when bouncer punched woman Shocking video shows drug addict writhing around on street School of sharks in feeding frenzy close to shore in Fingal Bay Dramatic footage of fight between Somali pirates and cargo ship Experience what it's like to land a plane after the engine fails Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte Trogneux thank French voters Someone brew it: Man tries to tap a keg but gets beer EVERYWHERE Dramatic moment an ADF aircraft drops bombs on IS target in Syria Playful Prince Harry squirts water at William during London Marathon Police throw protesters to the ground head first in Paris demo Video shows the terrifying moment a 4-year-old falls from a van EXCLUSIVE: This is the 22-year-old 'heroin addicted'...

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide People Are Reprogramming the Galaxy S8's Bixby Button Because It's Currently Pointless Michael NunezYesterday 12:55pm Filed to: Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Bixby Bixby Button digital assistants android technology 57 2 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Alex Cranz/ Gizmodo The Samsung Galaxy S8 is one of the prettiest phones you can buy right now, but it launched as a somewhat incomplete product. Bixby, the phone’s new digital assistant, doesn’t yet have one if its key features—voice recognition. This shortcoming wouldn’t be so obvious if only Samsung hadn’t included a new button on the side of the phone meant to launch Bixby. Thanks to some creative geekery, however, the seemingly useless button now has a purpose. Advertisement Crafty new owners of the Galaxy S8 are reprogramming the Bixby button to launch various apps, including rival digital assistant software like Google Now. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest by far is by using apps like Bixby Button Remapper, BixRemap, Goodbye Bixby, and Bixby Remap—all of which are available for free download in the Google Play Store. The apps essentially let you reprogram the Bixby button so that it can perform almost any task you’d like. That means that you can have it launch other apps, like the camera or flashlight—or you can do something as useful as reprogramming it to launch Google Now (not to be confused with Google Assistant, which is only available on certain phones). The programmer behind the Bixby Button Remapper told Gizmodo in an email that the app stemmed from a simple need. “I initially made the app because, well, I saw a need that wasn’t being met yet,” the programmer, who goes by Phascinate, explained. “Manufacturers do such a great job on the hardware of phones these days, but sometimes make some very odd decisions when it comes to software.” Advertisement Contacted for comment Samsung provided the following statement: With its intelligent interface and contextual awareness, Bixby will make your phone more helpful by assisting in completing tasks, telling you what you’re looking at, learning your routine and remembering what you need to do. The Bixby button is dedicated to activating these features, starting with Bixby Home at launch and expanding to Bixby Voice later this Spring. There you have it! Advertisement Sponsored True to their hacker origins, the apps aren’t exactly pretty. They’re mostly ham-fisted experiments from developers that wanted to make use of the extra button on the Galaxy S8. The description of the Bixby Button Remapper app, for example, says that it doesn’t actually monitor button presses on the phone. Instead, “it detects when the Hello Bixby app is on screen and instantly kills it and triggers whatever action you set within the app.” The BixRemap app is equally as rudimentary, with the creator describing it as “[an app] designed in 20 minutes.” There has been great deal of interest in reprogramming the Bixby button since day one. Popular gadget reviewer Marques Brownlee (aka MKBHD) issued an unofficial challenge to Android fans on launch day to anyone who was able to hack the Bixby button to launch the rival assistant product Google Assistant. The ability became possible in less than a week after his challenge through the All in One Gestures app, but Samsung reportedly eventually disabled the ability. But quite frankly, who can blame Galaxy S8 owners for wanting to get more utility from the extra button on their phones? It’s completely reasonable to be frustrated by Samsung selling a phone for a minumum of $750 that isn’t even a finished product. Don’t forget: This is supposed to be one of the best smartphones on the planet. It’s easy to understand why people are so mad about this useless button.

Google Fit v1.64 for Wear 2.0 can now identify strength training exercises and automatically count reps [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/24 8:19am PDTApr 24, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares125 Android Wear Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Automatically track strength exercises 1.2 Unit Settings 2 Download Google Fit stands as one of Google's only flagship apps on Android Wear, and may be the only one of its apps that matters more on a watch than it does on a phone. There's a new version of the app available on the Play Store for both watches and phones, but this update is all about adding a big feature for Wear. There's a new mode for recording strength training and similar activities that involve counting reps. This update is for Wear 2.0 only, so quite a few people will have to wait until the rollout is complete before testing this out, but it works on the last developer preview as well as any watch that already has the official 2.0 firmware. What's New Official Changelog: Automatically track your strength training exercises on your Android Wear smartwatch. Minor improvements. Bug fixes. Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Settings for units of measure Automatically track strength exercises Did you pick up a Wear device with the intention of recording workouts, then found that there wasn't much you could get out of the box? Sure, you could look to other apps, but if you wanted to use Google Fit, it only supported a few specific activities like walking and running, bicycling, and push-ups; but this did nothing for the wide range of exercises that you can and should do to get in shape. The new version of Google Fit expands the tracking capabilities significantly with a new Strength Training tool that greatly increases the range of activities that can be measured. To launch the Strength Training tracker, either open the "Fit Workout" item from the app launcher on Wear or open the Fit app and tap on the pink button to begin an activity, then look through the list for Strength Training. Once your session is recording, Google Fit will analyze motion of the watch to determine what you're doing and how many reps you've completed. When your set is complete, tap the button at the bottom and Fit will present your rep count. If you're keeping track of the count in your head and the numbers don't match up, you can adjust the count by sliding the top number to the left or right. If you're using weights, you should also slide the second number to the left to record the actual weight. Then scroll down a bit to the buttons titled Save, Delete, or Save and Exit. Saving the set will open up a follow-up screen with a countdown for resting before beginning the next set. In my very brief test, Fit successfully guessed I was doing bicep curls. I'm not sure about the rep count on that one, I was busy fiddling with screenshots. On my second test, I happened to switch arms and change the orientation of the watch, and this may have been enough to fool Fit into thinking I had taken to doing sit-ups. If this happens, you can tap the name of the exercise at the top to set the correct activity. For what it's worth, the rep count was correct. Overall, this is a pretty big addition and makes Wear considerably more useful for fitness tracking, especially in the gym. The workflow might still be a little cumbersome if each new set is supposed to happen immediately after the last, but this is still fine for most traditional workouts. Note: This feature was technically available on the stock firmware for the LG Watch Sport and possibly Style when they were fresh out of the box, but it seemed to disappear with either a server-side switch or an update to the Fit app. With this update, it's back for those watches and now available for all other watches on Wear 2.0. Unit Settings There is one other change worth noting, although it probably go mostly ignored. If you find that the units of measurement aren't to your liking, they can now be changed right on the watch. Just open Google Fit, scroll to the bottom to find the button to open Settings, then tap on the Units button. You can make changes for Height, Weight, Distance, and Energy. Most people probably won't need this, but it's a little more important now that Wear is intended to operate with less reliance on a paired phone. It makes sense if some users don't set up the app on a phone before using it on a watch for the first time. There's no harm in having it there.

Most AW watches I see are pretty nice. Too nice to want to wear as I work out in a gym with free weights. Wouldn't this make more sense with a partnering fitness tracker that you could wear with or without a nice watch? Morten Ulv I work out with a Urbane 2nd ed. Don't really understand what the issues would be? Doug McHone Isn't that watch a nicer piece of wear than what you would typically have on while working up a sweat? It just seems out of place for that application to me. I would rather AW make a fitness tracker similar to a fitbit for swimming and rigorous exercising. Morten Ulv I guess I just don't mind. I guess it could be nice with a fitness tracker companion, but then you might as well just use some existing one? Fitbit doesn't natively sync with Google Fit though, but there are workarounds. I use the watch for music as well (and calls since the Fitness Center watch my kids while I work out and call me if something is up), and then a fitness tracker wouldn't work. John Doe What happened to all the health tracking stuff? http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/01/25/google-play-services-v10-2-prepares-for-google-fit-v2-api-and-fido-certified-security-keys-apk-teardown/ Cody Toombs What do you mean? It hasn't launched yet. John Doe I thought it would launch with Android Wear 2.0. You know, Google Fit v2.0 and Android Wear 2.0? "Rumors have circulated for a while that Fit v2.0 will launch alongside Android Wear 2.0 next month." Cody Toombs Yeah, it definitely would have made sense, but it seems like they're still holding this back. Given that it didn't happen with Wear 2.0, and we're already staring down the barrel of I/O, the odds are pretty good that it will be announced (and probably released) next month. John Doe Google is really fucking things up with Android wear. It would be very embarrassing if I/O is here and all Android wear watches that were promised to be updated are not updated by that time. surethom Still not heart rate monitor Liam Alexander Colman This is also available on my Moto 360 Sport which hasn't been updated yet. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/76b7df372790b088b874c4e00d18392755bba1454b663e00ea922c85b82e6af3.jpg Antti Elonheimo I was about to comment the same. Haven't​ yet tested it out though. Liam Alexander Colman I have done some push ups and it worked ;) Antti Elonheimo Did it record heart rate data for you? I tested it also and it didn't. During rest it showed heart rate with something like "HR: --" under the timer. Don't know if something is wrong or not. It doesn't even show that in the screenshots in AP article. Liam Alexander Colman Yep same with the HR for me. Counts the reps though perfectly! Chewieez Same here. I used it today on my moto 360 sport. It automatically recognized jumping jacks and push ups and squats. It missed side lunges, but it was easy to input the workout. HR didn't seem to be recorded. surethom Google fit wear app is good but it's missing regular heart rate monitoring & sleep tracking F4LL0U7 Agreed, if they could keep the heart rate monitor active during your workouts, it would be great. F4LL0U7 They'd also need to let us do something with that information. When I manually measure my heartrate, that info seems to just disappear. Vadim Shun I cannot imagine it being able to detect pull-ups, chin-ups and headstand push- ups which are staple of my routine in a gym since hands in these exercises are largely stationary in these positions. Also still cannot take watch for activities such as whitewater kayaking so, while helpful for some, the app will still be disabled for me to save on battery. Morten Ulv I just tested chin-ups and it detected it perfectly. No clue how it does it though. Too weak to do headstand push-ups though, sorry! ;) Morten Ulv Detected push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, bicep curls without fault. Bench press was detected as Overhead press, but I just faked it on a sofa, so that might have caused it. Was easy to change it manually though (came up as first alternative). Maximilian Keppeler As a developer of a Push-Ups app, is there an API for identifying exercises? (Push-Ups) Taa Ynwa You don't need AW 2.0 for this. This works perfectly fine on my LG Watch Urbane 2 running AW 1.5 and Google Fit 1.64. Jaime Lopez If you start Sports Gear Tracker on watch and start Fit strength training workout on watch, fit will show average heart rate on fit strength training workout summary. So , both are running at same time. If you teach fit what movement you did after it tries to guess (i.e.) hand stand push up, it will learn the movement. My watch also shows"HR--" so keep hoping it is coming. I have LG Urbane and use Barton quick change bands to make it more workout suitable.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 393 Share on Facebook 119 Share on Twitter Total Shares594 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Jason Brown Given the more-more-more with less-less-less approach of modern news media, I'm astounded they have the time to monitor reader feedback. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. John Marshall’s Ghost Thank you for your response. This is the hallmark of professionalism. Typically, I wouldn't say anything but this is a) my wheelhouse and b) the whole "maximize shareholder value" is a pet peeve of mine because people think it's law when it's not and that has been the basis of 35+ years of failed economic policy (i.e., trickle down economics) and the justification for offshoring jobs. But, thank you again for the response. I thought your article was very well written and I hope this didn't come across as critical. I have done this to the NY Times, The Atlantic and various other organizations. Yours is the only article that has ever responded appropriately. Keep up the good work! 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Christopher Robert I'll bet you money there is a FB employee who reads messages. There is no way 100% of the messages are handled without any human oversight. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't? Railwayman Some interesting theories here. One thing I have a hard time to understand is this logic: "SMS fallback is not supported because Google doesn't make money off SMS" - OK, they don't make any more money from SMS even with a separate client. So if that would be the case, then they would just use the basic AOSP SMS client with absolutely no frills (just the barebones). Since we are talking Google/Alphabet it is a bit hard to see how it can bring "more revenue" to have a lot of different messaging apps. It is one thing that we have WhatsApp, Viber, Skype etc since it is... different companies and they want your money but here we have one company. I just fail to see how it can bring more revenue when you use Google Allo instead of Google Hangouts. Or using Google Duo instead of Google Hangouts. Or... IF there would be any kind of "sensible business" here - i.e. that "many messaging apps=increased revenue" then we would see other companies following suit. I.e. WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Trio, WhatsApp Friends&Family, WhatsApp GetTogether, WhatsApp Connect and so on - IF we buy into the thesis that "many messaging apps=increased revenue". Yet... we don't see this kind of strategy from the competition. Apple, which care a lot about their revenues would also have a couple of different messengers *if* there would be a strong business case here. I can't believe for a second that they would just keep iMessage and FaceTime if there would be a compelling business case of having a couple of other options. To recap: It doesn't make any business sense to develop a lot of different apps from *the same company* for the very basic thing of "messaging". A more appropriate strategy is to make *one* major service and to make it really good. It is actually pretty simple and no excuses about "business cases with many messengers" change it even a little bit. Android need: Android Messenger Description: Android Messenger is the default messaging client in the Android OS. It supports SMS (carrier and Google Voice), RCS and Android Messages instant messages (based off Hangouts). It automatically select Android Messages when the recipient has AM on their device, otherwise RCS with SMS fallback. All messages are automatically backed up to the cloud and integrated with Gmail. The user can setup Android Messenger using their SIM based number, GV number or Gmail address and it is done when the setup guide is running on first boot unless the account is configured already. Android Messenger work on smartphones, tablets and computers - every device that can sign in to a Gmail account is compatible since AM is part of Gmail. When you setup Gmail you simply get AM as well. Android Messenger is the standard client on Android devices shipped with G-Apps and is also the basic part of every G-App package. Android Messenger can be plugged in with a dialer tab for Google Voice accounts and is also seamlessly integrated with the Contacts app. I.e. all messages goes through AM. This would make sense and bring a viable competitor to iMessage. Explanations along the lines of "the business case of having several messages", "the carriers don't like default messaging apps", "Samsung doesn't like default messaging apps" and so on are just... excuses for a messed up system. Google can roll out Android Messenger for the simple reason that they have a dominating platform. What should the carrier do? Every Android device has AM so... their only option then would be to sell iPhone only BUT... they can't put their own client on there EITHER. So should they go back to selling feature phones? And Samsung? Telling Google that they are going to use Tizen if they can't put their own SMS client on? Especially now when they accepted GPM as their music player. I can say this: No OEM or carrier are going to stop using or selling Android because Google roll out Android Messenger in O or P. It is not exactly that way that we are going to see a "mass exodus" from the platform because they decided to integrate AM. If anyone seriously believe that Android is commonplace because the messaging app can be replaced by either "OEM Messenger" or "Carrier Messenger" I must recommend a reality check. And no, I don't think there will be any platform suddenly getting traction because "we hate instant messengers and we boycott Android but embrace new platform X because we can replace its messaging client". Especially not today when the carriers offer "unlimited texting". So Google can create a unified Android Messenger and push it on all devices without any problems with boycott or mass exodus of partners and carriers. The question is rather if they are able to assemble all their different teams and merge them in order to create Android Messenger. One thing is for sure: They have a lot to gain and very little to loose since such a client would get a lot of traction at the expense of WhatsApp and the likes by being integrated and the default option. Immediately when there are two devices with O or P for example everything is just... set and the messages are heading down the Google street. So if Google want to maximize revenue from messages, then this is the way to go - especially with Assistant integration.

(Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 24, 2017 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--YI Technology, the leading, international provider of advanced, intelligent imaging technologies, today unveiled YI HALO, a next generation virtual reality (VR) camera built with Google's Jump technology. YI HALO meets even professional VR creators’ and filmmakers’ most challenging demands. By combining the most advanced capture technology and stitching with ease and versatility, creators can see everything, go anywhere, and create vibrant, immersive VR stories and experiences with confidence. “Virtual reality provides incredible new opportunities for creators,” said Sean Da, CEO of YI Technology, “but it also poses a whole new level of challenges. To truly meet the promise of VR, the image quality, capture and stitching needs to match the immersive experience. To be truly active, you have to be able to shoot when and however you want, from many points of view, and without worrying about losing power; and you have to know it will just work, in your control, now and in the future. That is why we spent so many personal hours researching, perfecting and stress-testing the YI HALO. And why we are so excited to see what today’s amazing creators will do with what is now the most advanced VR system out there.” "We announced Jump in 2015 to make high quality VR video easier to create; streamlining capture, post production, and playback processes," said Amit Singh, VP of Business for Google VR. "Since then, Jump has helped produce immersive, compelling work, and we're excited to see what's possible using YI's next generation cameras." YI HALO is the highest fidelity 360-degree capture solution for maximum stereo effect, fidelity and immersion. It consists of 17 camera units including the Jump platform’s only up-view camera unit, allowing users to experience a scene in every direction without missing a thing. Built by the same engineers who created the acclaimed YI 4K and 4K+ action cameras, the YI HALO’s mechanical structure, hardware, firmware and software have been thoughtfully designed to deliver the highest level of imaging technology. Leveraging industrial design, electrical, firmware and optical engineering yielded a product that generates high quality 8K x 8K, 360º stereoscopic VR video at 30 frames per second, or 5.8K x 5.8K, 360º stereoscopic VR video at 60 frames per second. YI HALO is the most versatile 360-degree capture solution allowing demanding creators to shoot easier, longer and from anywhere. It has a 100-minute battery life, pulling only 50 watts, but also works with AC and alternative power sources. It weighs less than seven and a half pounds, including the battery, and is easy to mount and easily portable. It comes with clear, simple Android, WiFi remote controls, previewing and automated Jump stitching. Finally, YI HALO is a complete solution for 360-degree capture; it has been designed and tested to be durable, reliable and future-proof, undergoing over 100,000 hours of stress tests. It features a state-of-the-art, thermal design and a complete built-in screen system for easy control of camera settings and functions. It is a modular camera rig making it easy to upgrade or add new components as they become available in the future. Finally, users will be covered by a customer support package and one-click firmware upgrades based on direct user feedback. YI HALO is only one of YI’s advanced 360-degree video solutions unveiled today at NAB 2017. The company also announced today the consumer-grade YI 360 VR camera, the only camera to offer 360-degree capture up to 5.7k and automatically video/picture stitching in the device.

Unfortunately, they didn’t. Meaning: Most mobile websites are slooooooooooow. Consumers won’t wait longer than a few seconds. That’s a problem. It means the vast majority of mobile websites are losing money, practically forcing customers to bounce and go somewhere else. Here’s why that’s happening and what you should do about it. Slow Page Load Speed Sabotages Your Revenue The probability of someone bouncing from your site increases by 113 percent if it takes seven seconds to load, according to Google’s mobile page speed industry benchmarks, which were released in February. The problem? The average time it takes to fully load a mobile landing page is 22 seconds, according to the same report. That’s not good. In fact, it’s awful because that trickle down effect hits your bottom line, too. Slower sites cause more bounces which then lowers conversions: “Similarly, as the number of elements—text, titles, images—on a page goes from 400 to 6,000, the probability of conversion drops 95 percent.” This is nothing new. Slow page speeds have long been public enemy number one for years. Over a decade ago, then-Googler Marissa Mayer confirmed that Google themselves saw a 20 percent drop in traffic with just a 0.5-second delay. Mobile-first indexation is coming, and speed is the mobile SEO Achilles Heel. E-commerce brands lose half of their traffic if pages take three seconds or longer, which has motivated some to get up-and-running in less than a second. The primary reason for slow loads? In a word: bloat. Too much. The way you feel after a Thanksgiving feast. Google’s latest industry benchmark report analyzed more than 900,000 mobile ads from 126 countries (so sample size apparently ain’t a problem). Seventy percent of pages were over 1MB and “1.49MB takes 7 seconds to load using a fast 3G connection” (which brings things back to seven seconds and the 113 percent increase in likelihood to bounce). The solution isn’t easy. You’re not gonna like it. In fact, you might be tempted by a shortcut. It might seem easier initially to use a mobile-friendly alternative like AMP or Facebook Instant Articles. But that would be a mistake. Here’s why. The Problem With AMP & Instant Articles The Accelerated Mobile Pages Project (AMP) is a self-described “open-source initiative” with the lofty ideal to make the web faster. Companies who use their technology can see mobile pages load “nearly instantaneously.” It does that by minimizing the amount of resources required through optimizing and compressing notoriously ginormous files like your images. The ideals are lofty and ambitious. And the results are admittedly good. Wired Magazine is just one of many huge publishers to reveal glowing highlights, with a 25 percent increase in click-through rates from search results. Gizmodo’s AMP traffic is 80 percent new visitors (presumably coming via search). Why does AMP perform so well? You don’t need Benedict Cumberbatch for that one. It’s a Google-backed project. So AMP pages tend to get, how should we say, prime mobile SERP placement. That’s a good thing. But there are a few drawbacks. AMP is technically more difficult to implement, for starters. Jan Dawson argues that it’s effectively making it harder to publish on the web, writing: “Technically, these formats use standards-based elements — for example, AMP is a combination of custom HTML, custom JavaScript and caching. But the point here is the outputs from traditional online publishing platforms aren’t compatible with any of these three formats. And in order to publish to these formats directly, you need to know a lot more code than I ever did back in the mid-1990s before the first round of WYSIWYG tools for the web emerged.” Fortunately, things are slightly easier for WordPress sites. Here’s a three-step guide to setting up AMP on a WordPress site. There are other problems, though. Losing your branding on AMP pages is one thing. Not good but not a deal killer necessarily. Losing your mobile traffic to Google is quite another, and it’s also the crux of the issue. AMP content isn’t technically yours anymore. This can impact things like ad revenue, where results are mixed, as seen in the following tweets from Marie Haynes that caught my eye a few months back: Facebook’s Instant Articles work largely the same way as AMP. Similar pros and cons, too. Pages load on super speed on the plus side, reportedly up to 10x quicker. Early results from Facebook Partners also showed a 70 percent decrease in Instant Article abandonment (with a 20 percent CTR to boot). But the same proprietary infrastructure problems have caused many media conglomerates to hit the Pause button. According to analysis from NewsWhip and Digiday, several notable companies have pulled back on Facebook Instant Articles in the last year or so: Boston Globe went from an incredible 100 percent to 0 percent Business Insider posted 10 percent and now barely posts 2 percent The New York Times has dropped to 10 percent The Atlantic went from posting 85 percent to now only around 10 percent Other early adopters like the BBC News, National Geographic, and The Wall Street Journal are now “barely using the platform” Now, this isn’t a Chicken Little, “sky is falling” kinda thing. But it is a cause for concern. Mobile-friendly platforms offer a tremendous shortcut in boosting mobile page speed. However, there are very serious drawbacks, too, like band-aids on broken arms. A more prudent approach is to roll up your sleeves, take the long view, and fix your site from the ground-up. Here’s how to do it. How to Diagnose Slow Mobile Page Speed Test My Site is the new version of Google’s old PageSpeed tool (complete with the latest and greatest, 2017 OC Housewives-style facelift). So start there. Point and click. This page should pop up next. Just plug in your URL and hit Test Now. First, you’ll see the Mobile Friendliness score. Then in the middle is the mobile speed score in question. Ruh roh. Let’s scroll down a bit to find out more details on that near-failing grade. Click on that little box to bring up a detailed assessment of where your site is doing well, along with those areas that aren’t doing so well. Google mercifully goes into the details of which individual elements are causing you the biggest problems. Here’s another view of this mobile page speed assessment on a mobile device. Because… why not? Everyone loves a good meta joke. OK. So the result ain’t pretty. That’s fine. Because now we know what to fix. The next step is to dive into some of these new mobile page speed industry benchmarks and figure out how to increase them. Buckle up. It’s about to get geeky. How to Beat 3 Google Mobile Page Speed Benchmarks 1. Reduce Your Average Request Count Google’s Best Practice: Fewer Than 50 Requests are literal. Someone tries to visit your website and their browser requests information from your server. The data is compiled and sent back. The more requests, the longer it takes. Reduce the number of requests that need to be sent back-and-forth and you can greatly reduce average page loading times across the board. First, reduce the number of files that need to be sent. Yoast cites JavaScript, CSS, and images as your three primary problems. Minifying JavaScript and CSS kills two birds with one stone. It reduces the number of files that need to be sent back-and-forth. It reduces the overall file size, too. The GIDNetwork will help you run a compression audit. Gzip will turn website files into zip files for easier transfers. WP Super Minify is a WordPress plugin that will do a lot of heavy lifting for you. Otherwise, Yahoo’s YUI Compressor can help tackle both CSS and JavaScript compression. Contemporary web design is 90 percent image-driven. I just made up that stat. But you get the point. Today’s websites look like hollow shells if you remove the beautiful, retina-ready images that stretch across your screen. The problem is that images (if not handled properly) will kill loading times. Once again, Yoast recommends using CSS sprites to combine multiple images into one. SpriteMe, for example, will take background images and combine them to decrease the total number of individual images. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can also help you recoup bandwidth and cut down on website requests. They host large image files for you and distribute them across their own global network of servers. MaxCDN and CloudFlare are among the most popular. Last but certainly not least, reduce redirects you use if possible. Redirects create additional requests. So proceed with caution. 2. Decrease Average Page Weight Google’s Best Practice: Less Than 500KB Seventy-eight percent of shoppers want more product images, according to the Omni Channel Retail report from BigCommerce. The problem, as we just discussed, is that images can cripple page loads. They create more requests for servers. But they put your average page weight on a bulking plan that would make those meathead bodybuilders at your gym rage with envy. Page size should be less than 500KB according to Google. And yet a single, unoptimized, high-res image already clocks in at around 1 or 2 MB. You could start by simply cropping the sizes of your images so each is the exact width and height for the space it’s being used. Except, of course, nobody ever does that. Manually. Every single time they upload an image. So instead, let’s start by compressing the image file itself with something like WP Smush.it. A non-WordPress tool like Compressor.io can also reduce an image by up to 73 percent. Let’s run a quick scenario: Average e-commerce website conversions hover around 1-3 percent. That number can rise as high as 5 percent. (One example, Natomounts, sees 5 percent conversion rates with ~85 percent from mobile!) We just discovered that shoppers want more product images. And yet, according to Radware, 45 percent of the top 100 e-commerce sites don’t compress images! 3. Decrease Average Time to First Byte Google’s Best Practice: Under 1.3 seconds Time to first byte (TTFB) is a measurement that shows how long a browser has to wait before receiving its first byte of data from the server. It’s essentially a three-step process: A visitor sends an HTTP request to your server. Your server has to figure out how to respond. This includes gathering the data required and organizing it to be sent back. Assuming all goes well, the request is sent back to the visitor. TTFB is the time it takes for that complete cycle to finish. We’ve already covered a few potential roadblocks during this journey. Too many requests, too many redirects, too many junky WordPress plugins, etc. all take its toll. A website visitor’s own network connection and speed also make an impact. The aforementioned CDNs also help by reducing your server’s workload. They take over the burden of delivering large files so your own server can focus on delivering the rest of your site’s files and content. The best CDNs even go the extra mile. For example, reducing the physical location between the person requesting a file and the server sending it can have a huge impact. Caching reduces TTFB by helping web browsers store your website data. Best of all, it only takes a simple plugin (like W3 Total Cache) or using a premium web host that will set up caching for you at the server-level (so no additional tools or plugins are needed). A web host is like your server’s foundation. You can optimize images all you’d like. Use the best CDN on the market. But if you’re using slow shared hosting that splits resources, your site is going to be slow no matter how many tricks or tips or hacks you use. Last but not least, a little sleight of hand. Technically, removing JavaScript files from the head section and relocating them lower on an HTML document won’t reduce the overall number of requests or reduce file sizes. But it will help the important stuff — like the words on each page — to load a little quicker. JavaScript is selfish. It wants to load all of its code before allowing anything else on the page to have a turn. Pushing it further down forces it to wait its turn until after a few images and basic content can pop up first. Lazy loading is another common technique that won’t load (or display) an image until it’s within view. That way, page content can be loaded first. That’s helpful on long pages with tons of images (like this blog post). WPMU has a list of six lazy-loading WordPress plugins to try out. Conclusion Google has helpfully provided a few mobile page speed benchmarks to shoot for based on their in-depth analysis of what customers want. Unfortunately, the vast majority of websites are nowhere close to them. Slow mobile page speed has been shown to cause users to bounce, which affects where you show up in search results, and ultimately what your website is able to generate in revenue. Start by reducing the number of requests that happen each time someone visits your site. Then reduce file sizes along with average time to first byte. It’ll take some heavy lifting. Definitely some dev help. But it’s your only shot at rescuing sub-par performance that’s sabotaging your bottom line.

Lore Donovan, Google helps kids code at PS 1 STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Along with traditional reading, writing and arithmetic, students at Tottenville's PS 1 got a 21st-century lesson in computer coding Monday, thanks to a new program being rolled out by Google. PS 1 is Staten Island's pilot school for Google's "CS First Roadshow," a computer science program that teaches kids about the importance of STEM education through interactive coding presentations. "It's estimated that more than 500,000 U.S. computer science jobs will be unfilled by 2020. Programs like this are critical to ensuring that our next generation will have the skills they need to fill these positions," said Rep. Daniel Donovan, who attended Monday's program. "It's great to see young students engaged and inspired as they learn valuable skills that will support their future success." Google staffers brought in laptops to introduce each student to computer programing language and coding. Fourth- and fifth-graders used a program called Adventure on the High Seas and coding called "Scratch" to create interactive stories on their laptop. Former Staten Island Congresswoman Susan Molinari, now vice president of public policy for Google, was also at the demonstration. "Your future is going to be all about computers," Molinari told students. "Coding is not hard, it's not mysterious. You can do it. and it can be a lot of fun." Principal Grace Silberstein and Staten Island Schools Superintendent Anthony Lodico walked around looking over students' work and said they were impressed by their enthusiasm and knowledge. "Coding helps you edit and change things you want to do on your computer," explained fifth-grader Nicholas Baillargeon. He added he'd like to design his own app one day "to help people." More information about Google's CS First program is available at www.cs-first.com. (Click on the Comment button above if you would like to discuss this topic.)

The YI Halo, a new virtual reality camera that runs on Google's Jump VR platform. By Heather Kelly SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- What has 17 lenses, costs $18,000, and can make you feel like you're anywhere in the world? The YI Halo, a new virtual reality camera that runs on Google's Jump VR platform. Made by Chinese camera company YI with Google, the Halo shoots 4k video simultaneously on all 17 cameras. It uses Google's Jump software to stitch the footage together into a single, immersive 360-degree VR film. Google announced the new hardware Monday, barely a week after Facebook revealed plans for a pair of its own VR cameras: the x24 and x6. "Cameras are hot. That's good. We planned this a while ago," Amit Singh, Google's VP of business for VR, said at a briefing with reporters in San Francisco ahead of the news release. The YI Halo will go on sale this summer, and Google says some early partners will get rigs right away. Why are consumer tech companies competing to make expensive hardware for a niche professional market? They really just want to sell more virtual reality headsets. But first, they need content people can actually watch on their futuristic face-mounted TVs. The tech industry has spent the past year pushing virtual reality goggles like Facebook's Oculus Rift, the Samsung Gear VR and the Sony PlayStation VR. Google has two of its own lower-cost products, the Cardboard and the Google Daydream View. But virtual reality experiences are in short supply, in part because of how much time and money it takes to produce quality VR movies. Like most VR camera rigs, the YI Halo is a bunch of action cameras cobbled together into a ring with a single camera on top. It looks like an old-school slide carousel and weight about eight pounds. Though it has dabbled in other hardware, including phones and routers, Google partnered with a camera company on the Halo instead of making its own. Google is instead focused on the underlying technology, like algorithms that can stitch footage together with minimal mistakes in hours instead of months. One early YI Halo tester is virtual reality filmmaker Armando Kirwin of Milk VR, who said at the press briefing that Facebook's cameras aren't really direct competition. Instead, the Halo is aimed at lengthy multi-million dollar productions that use expensive special effects artists to put together the footage. As YouTube-owner Google knows well, there can be an advantage to volume over quality when it comes to content. To get more people shooting, Google is launching a program called Jump Start. Filmmakers can apply for free cameras and use of the Jump software. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Disable the Profanity Filter In Google Assistant By Eric Ravenscraft on April 24th, 2017 By default, Google Assistant will filter any bad words that you wouldn’t want to use in front of children. It’s the safer choice, but for adults who prefer their language a little spicier, you might want to turn the *!@$ing filter off. Google’s profanity filter is weirdly inconsistent. When transcribing text or reading search results aloud, Google will censor stronger words, but has no problem with words like “hell” or “damn.” However, search results are a little inconsistent. For example, if I open Google Assistant and search for “fucking hell,” Google will display both words on the screen and show me a search card for the German pilsner I was obviously searching for. However, it will only read the second word aloud uncensored. Obviously, this helps make sure that kids in the room don’t hear really bad words, but if you don’t have children, it’s a frustratingly inconsistent feature. To turn it off, open Google Assistant on your phone by long-pressing your phone’s Home button. Tap the menu icon on the right, then tap Settings.   Scroll down and tap Voice. Disable the toggle that says “Block offensive words.” This process should work if you have any Android smartphone running Android Marshmallow or higher. For older phones, you can also change this from your Settings app. Open up the Settings app on your phone and scroll down to “Languages & input.” Next, tap “Virtual keyboard.” Tap “Google voice typing.” Disable the “Block offensive words” toggle. Both options should allow you to send messages with as many unholy and improper words as you’d like. Google may still censor some words when read aloud, but you’re still free to be as profane as you’d like. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Eric Ravenscraft covers smarthome tech for How-To Geek.

My advice to Google and Facebook on brand safety Columnist James Green calls on tech behemoths Facebook and Google to work together to allow for transparency that will help fight ad fraud and ensure brand safety. James Green on April 24, 2017 at 11:46 am More What do buzzwords and populism have to do with one other? Undoubtedly, you’ve heard the latest buzzword, “brand safety,” as major advertisers like Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Verizon and hundreds of others have pulled their advertising from YouTube and Google Display Network because it was showing up next to hate-promoting videos. We also recently saw major advertisers pull out of traditional television spots during “The O’Reilly Factor” as its eponymous host faced controversial allegations of sexual misconduct. While RBC Capital analysts believe the financial effect to Google will be a minimal 1.7 percent because of Google’s dominance of search, Bill O’Reilly no longer has a job, and brand safety is a serious issue that has gone unnoticed until now. Due in part to the rise of populism and to our polarized political environment, consumers are hyper-aware of controversy. As people and consumers demand action and answers, brands must follow. Whether you work within the walled gardens of Google and Facebook or are part of the thousands of other digital media companies, it’s incumbent upon you to ensure the sanctity of your product and relationship with your customers. The need for transparency In my last article, A digital marketing CEO’s prescription to cure advertising fraud, I laid out a recipe for the marketing industry to combat ad fraud. With the rise of concerns for brand safety, it’s natural to expand on the need for transparency, which is the responsibility of technology vendors, agencies, brands and platforms. Not to pick on the duopoly of Google and Facebook, but they have created a non-transparent environment that must be penetrated. I can’t blame them for vying for greater market share, as every business that has ever been created has tried to corner the market or create an exclusive experience where profits can be reaped with less competition. This is true irrespective of industry. Mining and oil conglomerates exploit natural resources; Microsoft took hold of operating systems, Oracle of databases, AT&T in telecoms; Uber and Lyft disrupted taxis and have their own duopoly in transportation. And as these companies grow larger and larger, bad things happen when competition is reduced: blood diamonds, wars for oil, Microsoft bundling services (e.g., Netscape vs. Explorer), price gouging, poor customer service and predatory behavior. Google and Facebook are pretty great at producing wonderful, crowd-pleasing products. But they are pretty terrible about allowing anyone other than them to have control. Thus, you can do super-granular audience targeting on Facebook, but good luck analyzing that audience off the platform. Or you can reach people who are searching for your product on Google, but you can only target that audience if you have their email addresses. After Facebook battled with metrics problems, it has agreed to have some metrics audited by the Media Rating Council, and Google stated it will introduce MRC-rated companies for YouTube ad verification. But I doubt either company is about to allow the kind of full transparency on their platforms that will end problems that make advertisers wary. The good news is that it’s leading to thousands of smaller companies offering a differentiated product. Brand safety as a buzzword is front-and-center now, but it’s something that many companies always focused on. Transparency (which is all that’s needed to combat ad fraud) should be central to any business model, from inception through growth. A multipronged approach to brand safety What I believe most companies in our space can and should do, including our duopoly friends, is take a multi-pronged approach to brand safety. It means getting the right mix of tech and people working proactively to protect the integrity of brands in their media buys. Along with sophisticated data science that is always getting better at identifying people from bots, implement and use a quiver of partners like Integral Ad Science, Moat, DoubleVerify and anyone else your clients ask for. You can then prescreen ad inventory, conduct site analysis and scoring, do prebid targeting and use category and keyword exclusion to help ensure adherence to brand standards. Couple tech with the right people to manage blacklists and whitelists, and constantly monitor campaigns and post-impression reporting, which will make transparency a reality. Similar to attribution of impressions, variances exist in where accountability lies. Brands ultimately must accept responsibility for wherever their messages are seen, and they need to make their wishes clear to anyone they outsource the buying of media to. A trusted (agency) partner should take responsibility for making sure that ads run in the right place, which is doubly true if the agency is running the ads through its own trading desk. Of course, the agency is then often delegating that trust to partners who actually run the media (like Google and Facebook), who in turn should take full responsibility for their actions. Until solutions are presented and implemented, the issue of transparency continues as more brands demand inventory that is consistent with their good images. Popular culture has helped elevate brands and brand categories; the rise of populism has elevated controversial content categories. To begin solving the challenges of brand safety, and of transparency, I call on the big guys to do as the little guy does, and start working together. Partnerships help create new ideas and can hold each other accountable. You can cross the aisle, build a bridge, open a door, write an API — whatever the choice may be — the solution will come when we do it together.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman YI Technology and Google Unveil YI HALO at NAB 2017 LAS VEGAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–YI Technology, the leading, international provider of advanced, intelligent imaging technologies, today unveiled YI HALO, a next generation virtual reality (VR) camera built with Google’s Jump technology. YI HALO meets even professional VR creators’ and filmmakers’ most challenging demands. By combining the most advanced capture technology and stitching with ease and versatility, creators can see everything, go anywhere, and create vibrant, immersive VR stories and experiences with confidence. “Virtual reality provides incredible new opportunities for creators,” said Sean Da, CEO of YI Technology, “but it also poses a whole new level of challenges. To truly meet the promise of VR, the image quality, capture and stitching needs to match the immersive experience. To be truly active, you have to be able to shoot when and however you want, from many points of view, and without worrying about losing power; and you have to know it will just work, in your control, now and in the future. That is why we spent so many personal hours researching, perfecting and stress-testing the YI HALO. And why we are so excited to see what today’s amazing creators will do with what is now the most advanced VR system out there.” „We announced Jump in 2015 to make high quality VR video easier to create; streamlining capture, post production, and playback processes,” said Amit Singh, VP of Business for Google VR. „Since then, Jump has helped produce immersive, compelling work, and we’re excited to see what’s possible using YI’s next generation cameras.” YI HALO is the highest fidelity 360-degree capture solution for maximum stereo effect, fidelity and immersion. It consists of 17 camera units including the Jump platform’s only up-view camera unit, allowing users to experience a scene in every direction without missing a thing. Built by the same engineers who created the acclaimed YI 4K and 4K+ action cameras, the YI HALO’s mechanical structure, hardware, firmware and software have been thoughtfully designed to deliver the highest level of imaging technology. Leveraging industrial design, electrical, firmware and optical engineering yielded a product that generates high quality 8K x 8K, 360º stereoscopic VR video at 30 frames per second, or 5.8K x 5.8K, 360º stereoscopic VR video at 60 frames per second. YI HALO is the most versatile 360-degree capture solution allowing demanding creators to shoot easier, longer and from anywhere. It has a 100-minute battery life, pulling only 50 watts, but also works with AC and alternative power sources. It weighs less than seven and a half pounds, including the battery, and is easy to mount and easily portable. It comes with clear, simple Android, WiFi remote controls, previewing and automated Jump stitching. Finally, YI HALO is a complete solution for 360-degree capture; it has been designed and tested to be durable, reliable and future-proof, undergoing over 100,000 hours of stress tests. It features a state-of-the-art, thermal design and a complete built-in screen system for easy control of camera settings and functions. It is a modular camera rig making it easy to upgrade or add new components as they become available in the future. Finally, users will be covered by a customer support package and one-click firmware upgrades based on direct user feedback. YI HALO is only one of YI’s advanced 360-degree video solutions unveiled today at NAB 2017. The company also announced today the consumer-grade YI 360 VR camera, the only camera to offer 360-degree capture up to 5.7k and automatically video/picture stitching in the device.

The Yi Halo, as the camera is being called, will sell for $17,000 this summer. It is closely tied to Google’s Jump system, a cloud-based stitching solution that aims to take manual intervention out of producing stereoscopic 360-degree videos. The camera itself is being built by Yi, and comes combines 16 spherically aligned 4K action cameras with an extra camera facing upwards. The Yi Halo also has a dedicated LCD screen to monitor each of these sensors as well as overall battery life and more, and it ships with a bunch of extras, including batteries, an SD card reader, screwdrivers and even two extra action cams in the box in case something breaks while in the field The YI Halo is Google’s second cooperation with a camera maker to introduce a VR camera system that makes use of its Jump cloud stitching infrastructure. Google first introduced a camera rig based on GoPro’s action cameras dubbed Odyssey at its Google I/O developer conference two years ago, and began making that rig available to select partners soon after. But Odyssey was never much more than a test case, combining 16 of GoPro’s existing action cams with dedicated firmware and little more than a plastic rig, and GoPro and Google shipped just north of 100 of those cameras. The Yi Halo on the other hand is a commercially designed camera, with YI Technology CEO Sean Da telling journalists at a recent briefing in San Francisco that the company put a lot of effort into the heat dissipation to make sure that the system works even when teams have to shoot in the desert. Google and Yi also did away with another issue of the original Odyssey rig: The Odyssey was based on an array of 16 cameras that were horizontally aligned for optimal stereoscopic 3D video capture. However, the camera alignment included an obvious blind spot just above the viewer. Look up in any of the footage shot with the camera, and you’ll see blur instead of a blue sky or a detailed ceiling. That’s why Google and Yi added a 17th, upward-facing camera to the Yi Halo. That single camera doesn’t provide stereoscopic video for anyone looking straight up, but in most cases, the depth of the ceiling or sky matters much less than whether or not it’s there at all. What’s more, the camera is not placed on top of the rig, but placed inside of it to best simulate the way the human eye works. Related Virtual Reality in Depth: Inside Google’s Quest to Bring Back 3D Video (EXCLUSIVE) Google also introduced a new program dubbed Jump Start Monday that aims to get JUMP cameras into the hands of 100 additional creators free access to a Jump camera and the cloud-based Jump assembler. That assembler is a key component of Jump, and stitches the individual video file of each camera together to a coherent 360-degree 3D video file, ready to be viewed in a headset. Google has spent a lot of time optimizing the performance of its Jump assembler, bringing the time it takes to process one hour of footage down to 8 hours. Doing the same on a regular desktop PC could take months. Google isn’t the only company introducing a camera for VR video productions these days. Just last week, Facebook showed off its own VR video camera efforts, and GoPro previewed a new 360-degree video camera of its own. But Facebook’s efforts in particular have yet to to turn into a real product, a fact that Yi Da capitalized on while showing off the Yi Halo to reporters. “This is a commercial product,” he said. “It’s ready. It’s not a proof-of-concept.” But Da also readily admitted that the Yi Halo won’t be a huge money-maker for Yi Technologies, telling Variety jokingly that the company doesn’t expect any manufacturing constraints for the camera. So why do it? Developing a camera like the Yi Halo will help the company to build better, and significantly cheaper, consumer-grade VR cameras at some point down the line. “We’re a technology company,” he quipped.

Published on April 24, 2017. 0 Google Play Store is the hub for Android users to download a plethora of mobile apps, games and digital content, both for free and for a fee. Formerly known as Android market, Google Play Store also functions as an online store that sells music, movies and ebooks. Moreover, it also becomes a cloud media player that allows the user to listen to music. Google Play Store was introduced in 2012 which became one single platform which includes Google music services and Android Market. By the second month of 2017, there are already 2.7 million apps as well as 40 million songs. While new Android devices already come with Google Play Store, there are instances where the user needs to reinstall the app. This can be down by downloading the APK version. The most recent update is Google Play Store 7.7.17.0 and it comes with new fixes. For those who want to enjoy the features of the latest version of Play Store, there are two ways to download the APK version: via an Android phone or computer. Via a Mobile Device The first course of action to download and install Google Play Store is to enable “Unknown Sources”. Simply go to Settings > Security and select the box next to Unknown Sources. However, after installation is over, ensure that you deselect the box next to Unknown Sources. Next, go to one of the trusted mirror sites to download the APK file and which is also the latest version of Google Play Store. If you get a message that says “this type of file can harm your device”, simply press the OK button. Open the APK file and if there are new permissions request, read it and select Install to start the process. Via a Desktop or Laptop If your Android device is not currently connected to an internet, you can still download the APK version from your computer with internet connectivity. The process is also the same as downloading Google Play Store on your Android but instead, it will be stored on your computer. Once the APK file is saved on your computer, connect your Android device to your computer via USB cable and copy the downloaded APK version to your device. Next, launch the APK and select Install. Meanwhile, fake reviews on some Google Play Store have been discovered in March which obviously referenced games instead of being legitimate reviews.

Now the Xiaomi-backed Yi is expanding into the world of VR and 360-degree video with two new cameras being announced at the NAB conference in Las Vegas. One is for professionals — it’s called the Yi Halo, and it was made in partnership with Google. The other is a consumer spherical camera called the Yi 360 VR. The Yi Halo is a $16,999 17-camera monster capable of shooting stereoscopic video in 8K resolution at 30 frames per second, or 5.8K at 60 frames per second. It was built to work with Jump, which is a high-end VR creation platform that Google launched in 2015. The core idea of Jump is to encourage VR filmmaking by removing some of the biggest barriers. Google provides general blueprints for the ringed camera rig as well as server space for stitching all the high-resolution imagery together, and then gets to kick back while hardware companies and filmmakers create content to fill its budding Daydream VR platform. Google offers the plans and the tools in hopes that companies will create content for its VR platform Yi is just the second company to build a rig for the platform — GoPro released the 16-camera Odyssey last year. (IMAX is also working on a Jump-compatible camera setup, and Facebook has its own $25,000 and up solution in the Surround 360 rig.) The company is using modified versions of its 4K action camera to make up the Halo. And while it tops out at the same 8K resolution as the GoPro Odyssey, the ability to shoot 5.8K at 60 frames per second is unique. Grid View The Yi Halo also has one more camera than the Odyssey, which is placed on top of the rig in order to better capture 360-degree footage directly above the viewer’s head when observed through a VR headset. It also has a smartphone app, a touchscreen control panel, and there are levels on the rig structure so filmmakers can line up the horizon. Yi has a knack for these small, but meaningful, advantages over what GoPro offers. For instance, Yi was the first to make an action camera that shoots 4K footage at 60 frames per second, something professional GoPro users have clamored for since the Hero 4 cameras were released. Yi has a knack for small details, but the overall user experience is often hit or miss The $399 Yi 360 VR is another example of this overarching strategy. It can capture 360-degree video at 30 frames per second in 5.7K resolution, slightly edging out the 5.2K resolution of Fusion, the spherical camera GoPro announced last week. (That’s also higher resolution than other leading consumer 360-degree cameras like the Nikon KeyMission 360 or the Samsung Gear 360.) But while GoPro was thin on details for the Fusion, Yi showed up at NAB ready with specs for its announcement. The Yi 360 VR uses a pair of overlapping 220-degree lenses, two 12-megapixel Sony IMX377 sensors, and an Ambarella processing chip to stitch the footage together in-camera. It can also live stream 2.5K footage at 30 frames per second over Wi-Fi. Users should expect about an hour of battery life. Grid View Yi is a fly that GoPro can’t swat Yi might be a fly that GoPro can’t swat, but the Chinese company’s weakness so far has been everything beyond specs. Its action cameras aren’t as user-friendly, even if they’re typically cheaper. And, in the case of Yi’s first attempt at a mirrorless camera, they can sometimes be so frustrating that they don’t seem worth the savings. The Yi 360 VR will be available in limited release in June, so we’ll have to wait until at least then to find out of the trend continues. Both cameras, meanwhile, will come to the US before making it to Yi’s home base of China. Yi CEO Sean Da tells The Verge that, while he expects Chinese VR viewership to boom in the coming years, this is because the majority of “high performance, high quality video creators are still US or European creators.” To that end, the Yi Halo will be available starting today as part of a limited access program called Jump Start. As part of the program, Google will take applications from filmmakers to receive access to a Jump camera rig and unlimited use of the its Jump Assembler cloud service. Google plans to give out 100 of the Yi Halo cameras to help boost VR filmmaking, and the application process will be open until May 22nd. Update at 1:43PM ET, 4/24: Clarified that pricing for the Yi Halo is $16,999, not $17,999 as it was originally listed.

(Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 24, 2017 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--YI Technology, the leading, international provider of advanced, intelligent imaging technologies, today unveiled YI HALO, a next generation virtual reality (VR) camera built with Google's Jump technology. YI HALO meets even professional VR creators’ and filmmakers’ most challenging demands. By combining the most advanced capture technology and stitching with ease and versatility, creators can see everything, go anywhere, and create vibrant, immersive VR stories and experiences with confidence. “Virtual reality provides incredible new opportunities for creators,” said Sean Da, CEO of YI Technology, “but it also poses a whole new level of challenges. To truly meet the promise of VR, the image quality, capture and stitching needs to match the immersive experience. To be truly active, you have to be able to shoot when and however you want, from many points of view, and without worrying about losing power; and you have to know it will just work, in your control, now and in the future. That is why we spent so many personal hours researching, perfecting and stress-testing the YI HALO. And why we are so excited to see what today’s amazing creators will do with what is now the most advanced VR system out there.” "We announced Jump in 2015 to make high quality VR video easier to create; streamlining capture, post production, and playback processes," said Amit Singh, VP of Business for Google VR. "Since then, Jump has helped produce immersive, compelling work, and we're excited to see what's possible using YI's next generation cameras." YI HALO is the highest fidelity 360-degree capture solution for maximum stereo effect, fidelity and immersion. It consists of 17 camera units including the Jump platform’s only up-view camera unit, allowing users to experience a scene in every direction without missing a thing. Built by the same engineers who created the acclaimed YI 4K and 4K+ action cameras, the YI HALO’s mechanical structure, hardware, firmware and software have been thoughtfully designed to deliver the highest level of imaging technology. Leveraging industrial design, electrical, firmware and optical engineering yielded a product that generates high quality 8K x 8K, 360º stereoscopic VR video at 30 frames per second, or 5.8K x 5.8K, 360º stereoscopic VR video at 60 frames per second. YI HALO is the most versatile 360-degree capture solution allowing demanding creators to shoot easier, longer and from anywhere. It has a 100-minute battery life, pulling only 50 watts, but also works with AC and alternative power sources. It weighs less than seven and a half pounds, including the battery, and is easy to mount and easily portable. It comes with clear, simple Android, WiFi remote controls, previewing and automated Jump stitching. Finally, YI HALO is a complete solution for 360-degree capture; it has been designed and tested to be durable, reliable and future-proof, undergoing over 100,000 hours of stress tests. It features a state-of-the-art, thermal design and a complete built-in screen system for easy control of camera settings and functions. It is a modular camera rig making it easy to upgrade or add new components as they become available in the future. Finally, users will be covered by a customer support package and one-click firmware upgrades based on direct user feedback. YI HALO is only one of YI’s advanced 360-degree video solutions unveiled today at NAB 2017. The company also announced today the consumer-grade YI 360 VR camera, the only camera to offer 360-degree capture up to 5.7k and automatically video/picture stitching in the device.

Connectivity Google Really, Really Wants Filmmakers to Try Its New VR Camera The search giant is betting that more content will lead to wider consumer adoption of virtual reality. by Rachel Metz April 24, 2017 Google, convinced that live-action films and experiences are the way to get people interested in using virtual reality, is pushing out a new high-end camera system called Halo that it hopes will inspire filmmakers to create more things to watch. Announced Monday for its Jump VR platform, Halo is being made with the Chinese camera company Yi and includes 17 individual cameras—16 arranged in a ring, and one more facing upwards to help turn the resulting footage into a smoother-looking sphere of imagery. Like the previous camera system from Google, made with GoPro and called Odyssey, Halo is aimed at filmmakers and other kinds of professionals: it will cost $17,000, which is $2,000 more than Odyssey cost, but in addition to having a top-facing camera it is lighter and more portable, has a touch-screen display, and includes its own internal battery. Google, Facebook, and a handful of other companies see the development of fancy live-action VR cameras as one way to generate more things to see and explore in virtual reality. That’s important because lack of content is just one of many issues (others include pricey, bulky headsets) that hamper consumer adoption of the technology (see “Oculus Rift Is Too Cool to Ignore”). Google and Facebook in particular also sell VR headsets (Google’s smartphone-centric Daydream View and Facebook-owned Oculus’s Rift), so they have an even bigger stake in the nascent market.

Google’s New Chip Is a Stepping Stone to Quantum Computing Supremacy Big Data Exposes Big Falsehoods Flavor Networks Reveal Universal Principle Behind Successful Recipes Google’s Health Study Seeks 10,000 Volunteers to Give Up Their Medical Secrets And Google’s continued focus on cameras seems to make sense given what people are currently doing with Daydream headsets. At a media event last week to show off the camera, Amit Singh, who heads up business for Google’s virtual-reality team, said that more than half the time people spend with them involves watching videos. A number of companies have used the first-generation Jump camera to make videos, including the New York Times and the NFL. Since many filmmakers can’t afford to cough up thousands of dollars for a VR camera, Google is also starting a program called Jump Start that will let people apply to use Halo for free, along with the software for making VR films that goes with it. Google’s unveiling comes less than a week after Facebook showed off its latest VR camera, which captures live action along with depth data so you can move around while wearing a headset that tracks the position of your head. Most current virtual-reality cameras, including Google’s new Jump model, don’t give filmmakers that option, though you can turn your head around to explore a spherical video or photo.

The YI Halo, a new virtual reality camera that runs on Google’s Jump VR platform. Made by Chinese camera company YI with Google, the Halo shoots 4k video simultaneously on all 17 cameras. It uses Google’s Jump software to stitch the footage together into a single, immersive 360-degree VR film. Google announced the new hardware Monday, barely a week after Facebook revealed plans for a pair of its own VR cameras: the x24 and x6. “Cameras are hot. That’s good. We planned this a while ago,” Amit Singh, Google’s VP of business for VR, said at a briefing with reporters in San Francisco ahead of the news release. The YI Halo will go on sale this summer, and Google says some early partners will get rigs right away. Why are consumer tech companies competing to make expensive hardware for a niche professional market? They really just want to sell more virtual reality headsets. But first, they need content people can actually watch on their futuristic face-mounted TVs. The tech industry has spent the past year pushing virtual reality goggles like Facebook’s Oculus Rift, the Samsung Gear VR and the Sony PlayStation VR. Google has two of its own lower-cost products, the Cardboard and the Google Daydream View. But virtual reality experiences are in short supply, in part because of how much time and money it takes to produce quality VR movies. Like most VR camera rigs, the YI Halo is a bunch of action cameras cobbled together into a ring with a single camera on top. It looks like an old-school slide carousel and weight about eight pounds. Though it has dabbled in other hardware, including phones and routers, Google partnered with a camera company on the Halo instead of making its own. Google is instead focused on the underlying technology, like algorithms that can stitch footage together with minimal mistakes in hours instead of months. One early YI Halo tester is virtual reality filmmaker Armando Kirwin of Milk VR, who said at the press briefing that Facebook’s cameras aren’t really direct competition. Instead, the Halo is aimed at lengthy multi-million dollar productions that use expensive special effects artists to put together the footage. As YouTube-owner Google knows well, there can be an advantage to volume over quality when it comes to content. To get more people shooting, Google is launching a program called Jump Start. Filmmakers can apply for free cameras and use of the Jump software.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Google launches 2nd-generation Jump VR camera rig, the $17,000 Yi Halo Jordan Novet@jordannovet April 24, 2017 9:00 AM Above: The Yi Halo. Image Credit: Google Google today is announcing the launch of the second generation Jump camera rig for recording videos that are suitable for virtual reality (VR). One camera on the 17-camera system is situated on the top, enabling video capture from below, instead of just a 360-degree horizontal landscape. The new rig is called the Yi Halo, from the Chinese camera company Yi Technology, and it will cost $17,000 when it comes out this summer. The first-generation model, GoPro’s Odyssey, had 16 cameras and cost $15,000. The Halo can capture 8K by 8K stereoscopic 360-degree VR footage at 30 frames per second (FPS), or 6K by 6K at 60 FPS, Yi chief executive Sean Da told reporters during a media briefing last week. The rig has a companion Android app that serves as a remote control for the camera, which does have a touch display and provides video previews. After videos are shot, they can be sent to Google’s Jump Assembler cloud service to be stitched together. The Google service now processes 1,000 minutes of footage each week. When the service first launched last year, it returned stitched video in 24 hours; now it happens in eight, Jump product manager Emily Price said. Google chose to partner with another company instead of building its own camera for a second time, partly because “other companies are much better at building cameras,” said Amit Singh, vice president of business for Google’s VR division. Facebook, meanwhile, has chosen to build its own camera for two consecutive years, although this year the social network is looking to camera company Flir to build a brawnier 24-camera rig alongside Facebook’s own smaller six-camera system. Kodak, Lytro, and Nokia, among others, have also come out with cameras for VR. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

These constant shifts have challenged the hospitality industry to keep pace with new technology and trends so as to compete in the online community space. NB: This is an analysis by Jean-Luis Boss, chief marketing and digital services officer at Fastbooking. Optimising a hotel’s online distribution to drive more direct traffic requires digital marketing strategy and tools to be efficient and effective in their efforts within the online community. In 2015, just two years ago, organic traffic accounted for 62% of the traffic in a hotel website. This figure has reduced to 42% in 2017. Undoubtedly, this is still an important source of traffic for hoteliers to leverage on. The apparent reason being is that organic traffic to a hotel’s website is nearly free. However, this is not sufficient to drive more traffic and conversion to a hotel’s website. To compete effectively in the digital community space, an effective digital marketing strategy to drive more qualified traffic and conversion to the hotel’s website is pertinent. This plan, as we all know, encompasses search engine marketing (SEM), pre-and retargeting display ads campaigns, AdWords and the ultimate driver, metasearch. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, Metasearch has grown to become the most important advertising channel for hotels outpacing even AdWords, according to own data. And this trend is escalating. The evolution of metasearch in 2017 We have been managing metasearch campaigns for hotels for more than seven years. From the launch of metasearch, our hotel booking platforms were connected to the leading hotel metasearch channels to advertise direct hotel rates. During this period, we have seen ample growth for this digital channel, and we have learnt the strategy of optimising the various metasearch channels to generate maximum revenue for hotels with the best possible return on ad spend. We found it important to help hotels understand the various digital channels and how they work so that they can make better choices and decisions on advertising budgets. 1. TripAdvisor Over the last five years, TripAdvisor has held the dominant position in metasearch advertising, especially in areas of quality of traffic and revenue generated. The illustration below provides the year-on-year progress on revenue generation and traffic cost versus the return on ad spend. Although TripAdvisor remains as one of the key channels on the market and is still one of the best performing platforms for metasearch, its numbers have recently declined both in traffic volume and return on investment. Brief history: In 2012: The volume of clicks was much higher because TripAdvisor still had its infamous pop-under system (opens a separate page on the website). Anyone searching for information on a hotel would receive six or more offers at the same time. In 2013: TripAdvisor system changed to display dynamic rates, causing traffic to decrease while the cost per click increased. In 2014: The cost per click peaked to 400% from 2012, and the return on the ad spend declined. However, the conversion rate was much higher with much more qualified traffic. In 2015: The prices evened out and a steady reduction in the cost per click. Return on ad spend reverted to the 2012 level which was consistent around 10X the previous levels. Our analysis TripAdvisor produces highly qualified traffic with good conversion rates and has a very international audience even though it is strongest in North America. For hotels in Europe and Asia, this translates into a high return on investment as the average stay is longer than domestic or regional audiences. From our analysis, users who book through TripAdvisor has an average stay of 4.5 days. The bidding system has improved over the years but remains quite opaque. The priority is given to the highest bidder, and as an advertiser, you will not know how much that bid is. One can opt for a “share of clicks,” which somewhat guarantees that one will be visible and receive clicks a certain percentage of the time. Changes in bidding and campaigns can be managed on a daily basis. Our tip Do not systematically bid for the first position as the cost can rapidly raise and returns will lower. Instead, use TripAdvisor’s reporting to stay within the top 3. Additionally, if one’s ADR is low, opt for the “Instant Booking” model to keep costs low. 2. Google Hotel Ads Google launched Hotel Ads as Hotel Finder in 2011. Since then the product has changed names to Google Hotel Price Ads and now to Google Hotel Ads. The product and performance have grown exponentially every year both in terms of click volume and return on ad spend. Following a slightly different business model than other metasearch products, Google launched with a pay-per-click model that was based on the total cost of the potential reservation. They retained this model but added a performance model which is a percentage of the actual booking fee. Based on click volume, Google’s Hotel Ads matured in 2016, and today the click volume equal or surpasses TripAdvisor while keeping a very profitable Return on ad spend. As Google is integrating the ads deeper into its search results, maps, and other products, it is poised to become one of the leading hotel metasearch providers in the market. Our analysis Google Hotel Ads currently has the most qualified traffic of all metasearch providers. Traffic volume is now at a level that makes it a compelling investment for hotels and hotel groups of all sizes. However, it is quite complicated to manage the bidding system that offers extremely granular possibilities. This is too complex to manage unless one has a full-time e-commerce or advertising manager. Google Hotel Ads has stopped developing direct connectivity with hotels and is always connected through a third party. With Google’s experience and expertise in AdWords, they have developed a management system to optimise bidding and precise geo-targeting. The bids are managed every few minutes if not instantly, making it a reliable metasearch platform for budget control and adjustments. The system is very open and offers full transparency on performance, competitiveness and opportunities. Our tip To be effective when advertising on Google Hotel Ads, we recommend for budget hotels to switch to the performance model and for Deluxe and luxury hotels with a higher ADR to use the cost per click model. Hotels must ensure that these multiple campaigns are constantly monitored and managed. 3. Trivago Trivago has always been one of the main click volume producers on the metasearch market. The cost per click is the lowest of all the metasearch providers, yet the ROI has not been as good as TripAdvisor or Google Hotel Ads, although it is increasing. The steady growth of the platform since the part equity acquisition by Expedia in 2013 and the subsequent large investment in brand visibility through TV ads make this platform a very attractive option for hotels that require a boost in brand awareness. Our analysis From a budget management perspective, this is a platform that requires careful observation and management. We have seen massive traffic increases each time TV ad campaigns are launched. However, the conversion rate is relatively low. To ensure that budgets are not depleted, we recommend hotels to make sure that their budgets and bids are properly managed for maximum returns. Small changes in bids (such as a single cent increase) can have a significant impact on impression share and can result in budget over-spend. There is no built-in budget capping, though some third parties have created their own. The platform is improving quite frequently, including in its management possibilities. Trivago can be used successfully for international traffic, but it is most efficient with inbound travellers from Europe. Finally, the business model is the cost per click only. As many of the hotels used for this analysis were located in Europe, the average length of stay was shorter than TripAdvisor (2 nights versus 4.5). The ranking system is prioritised by the best rate first and the bid second, if there is full rate parity the bid obviously takes priority. Our tip As Trivago’s ranking model prioritises rates if one can have a slightly lower rate on their website one will get more clicks at a lower cost. 4. HotelsCombined HotelsCombined is one of the most important metasearch partners for our hotels in this area. One of the first companies in the hotel metasearch market, HotelsCombined delivers an excellent return on investment for hotels targeting travellers going to Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand demographics. Our analysis Although the click volumes are lower than TripAdvisor, Trivago, and Google Hotel Ads, the demographics served by HotelsCombined are a valuable addition to hotels seeking travellers from Asia Pacific region. Click volumes are stable, and the business model only costs per acquisition with very little control over visibility. However, it is a must if one wants to add traffic from those regions. 5. Google AdWords We have included Google AdWords, even though it is NOT a metasearch channel, as a comparison between advertising costs and returned on investment for hotel marketers. AdWords are still one of the most cost-efficient advertising channels for hotels both in terms of return on ad spend and click volumes. AdWords have consistently had the highest return on investment, and even though metasearch has recently overtaken AdWords as an advertising channel, in terms of revenue generated, it remains a vital channel for hotel marketers. The efficiency of AdWords is extremely high when using it to protect one’s hotel brand name from OTAs or other third parties trying to advertise on one’s name. Our tip Be careful when targeting broad or generic keywords such as “Hotels in [city]” as these keywords are very expensive and have a low return on ad spend for individual hotels. Focus instead on a mix of 80% brand keywords and 20% broader keywords with extreme care on budget spend. 6. Display advertising We also included display advertising as we have noticed through our campaign management that this nicely complements metasearch advertising, both in brand awareness and conversions. Through running multiple campaigns using targeted display channels and retargeting, we have seen an average return on ad spend of 10.2X. This makes it a very profitable addition to the advertising mix. Our tip Individual results depend on the hotel’s location: High-interest destinations such as the main cities tend to have a better return since there is more traffic from the pre-targeting campaigns. The trick here is to ensure that there is enough display volume to generate brand awareness without over-saturating the ads to the travellers, and knowing when to turn the campaigns off so as not to display irrelevant advertising to the guest. Key takeaways and recommendations Metasearch can help you drive more traffic to your website: Metasearch is to become the most important advertising channel for hotels. Select the different digital players that are most pertinent to your business according to your sales area and your objectives: mass volume or high return on investment. The efficiency of your direct booking strategy depends on your price: We have noticed a substantial difference in return on ad spend for hotels that chose to give advantages to direct bookings. Lowering rates for direct bookings is one of the most efficient ways to make metasearch generate substantial direct revenue. We have noticed a return on ad spend by an average of 2.5X. As a general rule of thumb, if one is selling at higher rates on one’s website the results will not be profitable. At rate parity, the results are acceptable, although this lowers the direct booking percentage. Look for professionals: To secure a hotel’s direct bookings or simply to increase revenue across multiple sources, metasearch and digital advertising channels have become mandatory channels for both independent and chains hotels. We recommend hotel groups and chains to create an internal team for campaign management and optimisation. For independent hotels, it would be wise to use an experienced digital agency. Keep monitoring: Metasearch, like all online advertising platforms, is not set-it-and-forget-it platforms. It requires optimisation to ensure that the return-on-ad-spend is kept profitable. (One final) Food for thought The constant change in technology has kept hoteliers on their toes with constant adaptation. Different shifts in digital strategies to maximise direct traffic includes metasearch in the hotel distribution mix. We have witnessed that if digital marketing strategies are handled with experience, paid traffic can represent 30-50% of market share per hotel. This is definitely worth the effort and attention. Metasearch, notably Google Hotel Ads, are strong allies to Independent hotels. This would provide high visibility and conversion as compared to OTAs. Now the question that remains is “How to be connected to Metasearch?“ Hotel distribution is not going to get simpler; it will require a constant shift of strategies. Mobile, new technologies such as chatbots, etc. will continue to transform the digital landscape. But this also mean new opportunities and improved performance possibilities for hoteliers that embrace these new trends and technology.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website William Beckler ROAS is the wrong number to look at for these channels, as so many of them are non-accretive. The real number to think about for a hotelier is *incremental* ROAS. If a click comes from Tripadvisor, that is not necessarily incremental, since that customer probably would have booked even if they had not clicked on a hotel website link on Tripadvisor moment. Same goes for the other channels, but in every case the incrementality factor changes depending on the kind of searches happening on those channels. Tripadvisor gets hotel-specific searches. Same with Google HPA. Trivago and Kayak are dependent on what other bids are coming in, because they adjust overall rank based on bids. In most cases, when OTAs are competing for clicks, the incrementality factor is affected by the commission rates of the OTAs, because a nondirect click doesn’t mean a nonbooking, it just means a booking via an OTA. Reply 4 days ago   tralari nondirect click doesn’t mean a nonbooking, it just means a booking via an OTA. Hence more expensive. Metasearch is no so much about incremental bookings but about getting those bookings at a cheaper commission and taking some business out of OTAs so they become less important in your overall distribution. Reply 22 hrs ago   Martin Agreed it is not necessarily incremental. To generate incremental bookings requires a much larger strategy working on the inspiration end of the marketing funnel. Metasearch and (arguably) adwords are more focused towards the end of the funnel. Hence why working with OTAs is beneficial. But when talking about direct bookings it is more about optimizing channels than adding new incremental revenue.

Here's how to delete the Google Search bar on Android without rooting your phone. Remove the Google Search bar from Android by disabling Google Now, or using a custom launcher or ROM By Marie Brewis | 24 Apr 17 Recognise this? That's the Google Search bar, and on some Android phones it is set to appear at the top of every home screen, taking up room you'd rather give to app shortcuts. Also see: Best custom Android UIs There are a couple of quick and easy ways to remove the Google Search bar, and we'd advise starting with the most obvious: tap and hold the search bar, and see if you can drag it to a remove button at the top of the screen. Unfortunately, if the phone came like that out the box, this probably isn't going to fix your problem. Here are some alternative fixes. See all Android tutorials Disable the Google app The second easiest way to remove the search bar is to disable the Google app. However, it's not ideal because that space doesn't then become available for app shortcuts. It also stops Google Now working, so use this method only if you want to remove the search bar for aesthetic reasons. • Open Settings • Select Apps • Choose Google App • Tap Disable • Tap Disable App when prompted Use a custom launcher A better alternative is to install a custom launcher, which allows you to customise the way your Android home screen looks and works without removing any functionality from the phone. There are literally thousands of free launcher apps, many of which can be found in Google Play. (We'd recommend sticking to only those launchers for security reasons.) Simply go to the Play Store and install the launcher you most like the look of. There are paid-for and free launchers. Here's Nova Launcher in action: • Open Google Play • Search for Nova Launcher • Select the app and click Install • Once the installation has finished click Open • If you've used Nova Launcher before you may have a backup you'd like to select, otherwise choose Skip • Tap the Nova Launcher icon on your home screen to switch to that interface • Now when you tap and hold the Google search bar you will be given options to resize, remove or edit it. Should you remove it this space can be used for apps • You can set Nova Launcher as the default launcher app in Settings, Apps, App Settings (click the cog icon), Home app Read next: Best Android phones and Best Android tablets 2017 Follow Marie Brewis on Twitter Tags: Smartphones, Software, Android Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

[Photo: courtesy of Google] By Daniel Terdiman04.24.17 | 12:00 pm Almost every day, it seems, a new camera for shooting virtual reality content is announced. Ranging from consumer-grade devices that cost a few hundred dollars to those meant for Hollywood filmmakers that come with five-figure price tags, the goal is the same: to ensure that there’s more and more VR content so that people buy more VR headsets. advertisement Last week it was Facebook, which unveiled its professional-quality x24 and x6 cameras. Today, it’s Google’s turn, with the unveiling of the company’s second high-end VR camera, the Jump Halo. Developed by Google and made by China’s Yi, the $17,000, 17-lens Jump Halo—and its associated post-processing software and distribution system—is meant to shoot high-quality 360-degree video, stitch it together automatically, and be light enough at 7.5 pounds to take just about anywhere. [Photo: courtesy of Google] Google launched its first Jump camera last year. This Jump is all new and includes what the company said was the most-requested feature for a second-generation: an upward-facing lens that ensures the video it shoots captures not just 360 degrees, but also everything above the camera, and then stitches it all together seamlessly. The Jump Halo can shoot 8K by 8K stereoscopic 360 video at 30 frames per second, or 6K by 6K at 60 frames per second. It also gives filmmakers total control over parameters such as ISO, white balance, and the like. It’s optimized for Google’s VR platform, says Yi CEO Sean Da, and ensuring content works with Google’s stitching algorithms, which aim to remove most if not all of the telltale lines that often betray where content from one lens didn’t quite mesh with that of the next one over. The camera can be powered by a mobile app that gives a “consumer-type experience,” Da says, giving filmmakers control over things like a live view from the camera, as well as the ability to change settings remotely. And once shooting is over, it’s meant to be easy to load the footage into an assembler program. Content then is processed and ready in a matter of hours. According to Emily Price, Jump’s product manager, the Jump assembler software is able to return fully stitched video in about eight hours, down from the 24 hours it took just a year ago. But, she says, the tool can show a “rough stitch” preview on a laptop while still shooting. advertisement With high-end VR cameras from Facebook, Jaunt, Nokia, and now Google available, one might imagine filmmakers would have a hard time choosing. But according to Armando Kirwin, a VR filmmaker with Samsung’s Milk VR who had early access to the Jump Halo and was one of the first to use Facebook’s $30,000 first-generation Surround 360 camera, there really isn’t that much confusion. “It’s a different tier,” Kirwin, who spoke at a Google press event unveiling the camera, said of the Jump Halo in comparison to the new Facebook devices. [Photo: courtesy of Google] By that, he means that Google’s new camera is meant to be portable, affordable, and within the reach of many filmmakers. Facebook’s camera, on the other hand, is aimed at professionals on multimillion-dollar shoots. “You can [use the Jump Halo] by yourself,” Kirwin said. “Facebook’s camera requires teams of professionals, which are more expensive. His point was really to stress that although it might be tempting to position the VR cameras from Google and Facebook as competitors, they’re really aiming at totally different markets and shouldn’t be thought of as such. [Photo: courtesy of Google] Still, Kirwin appreciates that VR filmmakers now have many choices for shooting their projects. “When we started making cinematic VR, there were zero cameras” on the market, he said, “so we had to build our own. advertisement Now, there’s a proliferation of cameras, and that means that soon, VR production will be “democratized.” Added Kirwin, “That’s fine. That’s the way Hollywood works now. It’s inevitable VR would work that way.” And that’s nothing but a good thing as the need for VR content to motivate people to buy VR headsets becomes more acute. “Within a year, cameras that [once] cost us $1 million will cost $10,000,” he said. “The number of people creating content is exploding. That makes a huge difference in the industry.” About the author Daniel Terdiman is a San Francisco-based technology journalist with nearly 20 years of experience.

Its Assistant-powered smart speaker can now recognise and distinguish between different voices, enabling it to seamlessly switch accounts and talk to everyone in a family. The capability has been a top request from customers since the device's launch. Its release enables Google to step up the fight against smart home leader Amazon and its digital assistant Alexa. Home speakers can now be connected to multiple phones owned by different people. If you're registering as a new family member, you can connect to the Home by selecting it in the list of available devices and tapping "Link your account." Your identity will be added as another user and you'll be asked to train Home to recognise your voice. Once setup, you'll be able to use the Home app on your phone to customise your unique preferences for the device. When you're speaking to Home, it'll use the settings from your phone. If another family member starts a conversation, Home will immediately connect to their linked account instead. Google distinguishes between voices using an advanced neural network. By listening to how you say the activation hot phrases "OK Google" and "Hey Google," it can work out your identity. When you configure your account, the fingerprint of your voice is saved to the device. The next time you say "OK Google," Home will compare your voice to its saved samples and determine which account to use. The inclusion of a neural network means the process takes an almost imperceptible amount of time. According to Google, it should be a "matter of milliseconds" before Home has worked out who you are. Once the device has established your identity, you can talk to it as normal and it'll access your data and preferences as if you're the only user. Google is recommending that you do not rely upon voice recognition alone to secure your data and Home. The device could occasionally misidentify you or grant access after hearing a voice recording. For now, the feature is solely designed to alleviate one of Home's biggest problems, its inability to easily serve everyone in a family. The implementation of the feature also gives Google a marked advantage over key rival Amazon. Alexa already supports multiple user profiles, enabling different family members to talk to devices. However, it currently lacks the automatic identity detection system that Google has developed, restricting its usefulness. Home now offers a more seamless solution that lets anyone in a family ask Home a question without having to reconfigure the device first. Google Home's multiple user support is already rolling out to devices in the U.S. When it's available, a "multi-user is available" notification and card will be displayed in the Home app. You can tap the card to start adding another user. The feature will arrive on devices in the U.K. "in the coming months."

The company's share price has seen a lot of volatility, but there are a few things Himax investors should be looking forward to. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 24, 2017 at 10:51AM Himax Technologies' (NASDAQ:HIMX) stock price has seen some highs over the past few years on the prospects that design wins in augmented reality (AR) devices will bring big gains for the company -- only for share prices to tumble as those opportunities never quite panned out. The first instance of market excitement happened a few years ago when Alphabet's Google took a 6.3% investment stake in Himax, with an option to purchase another 14.8%. Google was building out its Glass device, and many Himax investors were expecting huge benefits from the partnership between the two companies. In the end, Glass hit major roadblocks -- mainly from the public -- and it never became the device Google or Himax expected. Due, at least in part, to the Glass partnership sputtering, Himax's share price took a cliff dive in early 2014: HIMX price chart by YCharts. Since then the company's share price has been much more volatile, and subsequent AR design wins, like the Microsoft Hololens, have also failed to bring share-price gains for Himax, though the stock hasn't experienced anything as dramatic as the 2014 slide. So are Himax's growth days over? The short answer: probably not. But it could take a little while longer before the company regains its bearings.  Why Himax has more room to grow It's easy to fall into the trap of believing that whatever's happened in the past will happen again in the future. For Himax, that means that failing to capitalize on Google Glass and Microsoft's Hololens doesn't necessarily mean that the company can't substantially benefit from this market.  The AR market will reach an estimated $117 billion by 2022, according to Markets and Markets research, and Himax has a strong position in the space. The company has been working with 30 AR-related companies over the past 15 years, and that experience and exposure to the augmented reality market could be lucrative -- but the company has noted that the benefits might not be seen until later next year.  The caveat is that investors shouldn't get fixated on Himax grabbing one big design win for an AR device. The company will likely need several design wins across a handful of AR devices in order to bring long-term, sustainable growth.  One promising bit of news lately was the company's investment in Emza Visual Sense, which makes visual sensors and proprietary machine-vision algorithm tech. Himax now owns 45% of the company with a one-year option to purchase the rest of it. The company says that gaining some of Emza's technology could help it expand its offerings across a handful of its businesses, including augmented and virtual reality. I've been bearish on Himax in the past because I think investors tie this company too closely to one AR play, and then when that device doesn't pan out, the stock tanks. I'm not changing my position on that, but I do think the company has potential if it can score several big design wins and spread its risk out among several companies. Himax is gearing up for new products within its AR business in the latter part of this year and into 2018, which could eventually help bring revenue and boost the share price as a result. In light of this opportunity, I'd take a carefully optimistic approach to Himax for the time being, and wait to see how the company fares over the next few quarters.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares202 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezelless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen-to-body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8 or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold on to it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that are specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on your phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode. Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is an all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart MJ Yeah, it's just horrible here so don't believe anything you hear and certainly don't waste your time immigrating here. whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ My son just got his S8+ and the white is white as snow. The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe it is a defect, I don't know. If I got a pink one, I'd return it. I wouldn't accept a software update. I'm also wondering if at least some of the people who think they have pink displays simply have the blue filter turned on. 4Ui812 The blue filter shouldn't be causing that sort of issue. Hell the blue filter on my s7e doesn't make that much of a difference. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½.

The very first Android phone, the G1, had the buttons in this order: Phone - Home - Trackball - Back - Hangup/Power So the back button was originally on the right.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! TheScientists I'm kind of amazed someone hasn't already done this. It's the most basic of necessary functionality in an 'assistant'. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ So after posting this yesterday I looked into it, and sadly there's still no official API for creating reminders, and surprisingly no one has made an unofficial one either. So then I extracted the Inbox APK and decompiled it, I'm working my way through the code to see if I can't start pinning something down, but I'm betting they'll release actual support before I manage to do that. TheScientists Kudos to you, sir. I would have thought there would be something of note in the Google app apk? Or maybe some 1/2-assed way to do it via IFTTT. And, no, I wouldn't take that bet. Google is in no rush to do anything. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The problem is that the decompiled source doesn't exactly come across in a way that makes perfect sense. If a Java class isn't named in the manifest, it ends up getting somewhat obfuscated by proguard, so instead of seeing something like ReminderBuilder I end up with something named C12345, and even the classes are built in such a way that an object ends up being built up through multiple classes instead of just in a singular method, so it's complicated. I did look into IFTTT as well yesterday hoping for a quick solution but was disappointed. We'll see how far I get before either finding some options or just giving up out of frustration. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. dcdttu Once you can distinguish between users isn't all you need for reading/writing appointments....you've got to actually code that process, too. That's likely what they're doing now. So far in my testing at my house, it's quite good at knowing the different voices in our household. I wouldn't see their lack of confidence being a problem, honestly, because before the multi-user features were enabled, you could get personal information off Google Home for one user. Adding more than one user, even if it's giving the info to the wrong person, doesn't seem to be any worse. pfmiller My assumption was that they already have the code for writing data to their services since it's already done in every other application. That part of the problem isn't exactly novel. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! Jimjames Esson Well said,, Google to me ,if i have a Rheumotolgy appointment i simply use Google Calendar..!! Easy peasy lemon sqeasy..lol Blake What's an SRE? M6 https://landing.google.com/sre/ Petr Faitl I highly suspect that the answer is a highly political. No doubt it's product managers who can't agree with privacy gurus to prevent a few pranksters (i.e. one's kids) adding events to your calendar. abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Lars Jeppesen Who cares mustbepbs I do, because when I want to add a few minutes to a kitchen timer, I have to cancel the current one and create a new one with the new time. Kitchen timers from fuckin Dollar General have this "feature". abc He does. As he just said. Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. Ryan Music, pairing it with Smartthings to be a home controller, etc. I USED to use it for my shopping list, which was great. But they broke that function just recently. Nicholas Conrad People I think don't understand what Google Home is for. It's not an Assistant appliance, it's a good (admittedly not great) chromecast speaker at an entry-level price point. Assistant baked in is gravy, but not the primary use-case. It's basically only there for Google to farm Assistant interactions to jump-start their ML dataset. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. Lars Jeppesen I love mine - I'm sorry you can't figure out why it could be useful. Ryan I got mine on discount, so that helped. But I use it as a voice control for my smart-home features and to play music. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget... A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk— Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 trickytree1984 Support for exchange calendars is just as important. Most of the world don't use one personal Google calendar for their work and home life Navarr Barnier I'm assuming that MU was a blocker ticket, and they just pushed it out as quickly as they could - so reminders and appointments would be a WIP now that the blocker is out of the way. Surely.. right? right? Jonathan Sorry, but I just don't care about not having this feature, and I don't think many average users do either. But it wouldn't be a post about the Home if AP didn't gripe about it! Ryan Id use it daily, just like how I used the shopping list daily. Its a pretty basic feature that most people use (which is apparently by the unlimited competing choices for calendar and todo apps). Jonathan I agree that it's a basic feature that seems simple enough to execute and should have been implemented from the start​. I just don't think that many people are clamoring for it in their Bluetooth speaker outside of the AP sphere. And it's just getting silly and petty that the AP writers mention it in 95% of the articles they write​ about it. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The Home isn't just some Bluetooth speaker. It's SUPPOSED to be an assistive device that currently doesn't do the most basic tasks. I set reminders constantly across my phone, my watch, and in my car. It drives me crazy that I still can't do this on what is marketed as being the flagship device for Google Assistant. Ryan Or place items in Keep, like it used to be able to do. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I would love to be able to add items to ANY list in Keep. When my wife and I organize parties we use shared lists in Keep and it would be great to just add things as we talk about them. Stephen Cunningham I cant' get over Google taking the shopping list out of Keep. They are walking backwards not forward. I was hoping you would be able to add to any Keep list or add a note to Keep. Mike Jones i would like to add calendar appointments and i would like to add another minute to a timer too but that doesn't kill Home for me. i have a lot of home automation and i get a ton of use out of that. i just had a scare the other night where i thought i heard something in my house right as i was getting into bed. "google turn on the lights" and my house lit up like daytime.... it made it simple to check out the house. papastevez Can't cast videos from google play movies yet either. ಠ_ಠ Follow Android Police 1.5M 466k 142k 108k Latest Deals 24 [Update: Now it's cheaper] Deal Alert: Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/24 7:35pm PDTApr 24, 2017 23 dbrand debuts grippy new Black Dragon skin, offers 20% off storewide until midnight ET 2017/04/24 5:26pm PDTApr 24, 2017 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 35 temporarily free and 26 on-sale apps to get your week going 2017/04/24 2:54pm PDTApr 24, 2017 5 [Deal Alert] Ring Video Doorbell Pro down 20% to $199.99 on Amazon 2017/04/24 5:27am PDTApr 24, 2017 35 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $136.99 ($163 off) from eBay 2017/04/23 12:36pm PDTApr 23, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Microsoft is expected to unveil Windows 10 Cloud next month, and leaked specs suggest that it is being positioned as a competitor to Google's Chromebook platform. And what about the iPad? By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | April 24, 2017 -- 14:45 GMT (07:45 PDT) | Topic: Microsoft Microsoft is expected to unveil Windows 10 Cloud next month, and leaked specs suggest that it is being positioned as a competitor to Google's Chromebook platform. Must read: Apple's big $1,000+ iPhone gamble Windows Central got its hands on an internal document that outlines the basic specs for Windows 10 Cloud devices, as well as drawing direct comparisons to Chromebook devices. The basic specs are as follows: Quad-core (Celeron or better) CPU 4GB of RAM 32GB of storage (64GB for 64-bit) A battery with a capacity greater than 40 WHr Fast eMMC or SSD storage technology Optional pen and touch The performance comparisons suggest that Windows 10 Cloud systems would have battery performance figures identical to that of a generic Chromebook, and boot and login times in the same ballpark. Windows Central what's hot on zdnet The death of the smartphone is closer than you think. Here's what comes next IBM's five years of falling revenues have left it smaller than Apple, Microsoft and Google Digital transformation is a work in progress for most companies Does Microsoft have what it takes to take on the Chromebook and the iPad? The wording also makes it clear that these devices are aimed at the education market, and perhaps are designed to pave the way for more affordable versions of the Surface Book. On paper at least, the specs are impressive. Doubly so because we're talking about Windows here, and not Google's Chromebook platform, which was designed from the ground-up to be fast and lightweight. Another striking thing about the hardware specs for Windows 10 Cloud is how they're better than the baseline specs for Windows 10. It's clear that Microsoft is keen for Windows 10 Cloud to make a good impression as it prepares to go head-to-head with the Chromebook. This will encourage OEMs to build better systems (although on the flipside, it remains to be seen if people will be willing to pay for those systems). But can Windows 10 Cloud unseat the Chromebook? Much of the popularity in schools of Chromebooks has little to do with the hardware specs, and more to do with the low-cost, high-security, ease of administration, and the ease with which damaged or stolen Chromebooks can be replaced. Fast hardware and rapid boot times are nice, but these are low down the list of priorities for schools. Who "wins" and who "loses" in this battle is going to come down to more than just the hardware specs. But what about the iPad? The increase in Chromebook adoption in schools has put a serious dent in iPad sales, and Apple's recent bout of price slashing makes it clear that the Cupertino giant isn't going to just sit back and let Google walk into schools without a fight. Adding a third player into this fray just means more competition. And PC OEMs who are struggling with razor-thin margins might not have the stomach for any real fight. Both Windows RT and Windows Mobile have, in part, died because hardware makers gave up on them. It's also a little bit unclear as to why Microsoft really cares about this market. On the grand scale of things, Chromebooks are a drop in the ocean, and while you could say the same for Macs or iPads, you can be sure that no one selling Chromebooks is banking on a 30+ percent profit margin like Apple is with its hardware. Other things to watch out for Also, let's not forget that tech is fast moving, and that it's unlikely that Google is going to sit still in this space. However, just like Microsoft, Google has to convince other OEMs that it's a platform worth supporting and fostering. And hardware makers are only interested in doing that if there's money in it. I've seen theories that suggest that if students are exposed to a platform at school, they're more likely to use that platform in later life. Given the explosion in use of Android, iOS, and macOS, I'm not sure if this thinking holds true anymore (or whether it ever did). But all that aside, if those hardware specs translate into real-world machines then Windows 10 Cloud is a space that everyone -- educators, consumers, and enterprise -- will need to keep a close eye on, because some interesting things could come from it.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION Larry Page’s Kitty Hawk announces ultralight aircraft you don’t need a license to fly Paul Sawers@psawers April 24, 2017 8:05 AM The fledgling “flying car” industry just received a major boost as Google cofounder Larry Page officially launched his new startup out of stealth. Founded in 2015, Kitty Hawk has been known to exist for some time already, but we’ve hitherto had no real idea about what it was all about — beyond it having something to do with flying cars. But earlier this morning, company CEO Sebastian Thrun, who once headed up Google’s self-driving car efforts and later went on to found online learning platform Udacity, tweeted out a link to the company’s website and Twitter page. Kitty Hawk’s website now offers some clue as to what we can expect. Check out the new @kittyhawkcorp Flyer https://t.co/wqFtZ0sUPY. — Sebastian Thrun (@SebastianThrun) April 24, 2017 It transpires that Kitty Hawk isn’t working on a “flying car,” as such, instead it’s working on a personal “ultralight aircraft” designed to be flown in “uncongested” areas, particularly over fresh water — it can’t be flown in cities. And, crucially, it doesn’t require a pilot’s license, which opens things up to widespread recreational use, though this will naturally raise some safety concerns. The “Flyer,” as it’s known, will go on sale by the end of 2017, and although we do not yet have a firm price, Kitty Hawk does hint that this will be a pricey contraption. Interested parties can pay $100 now for a three-year membership, which gives them “priority placement” on the waiting list plus a $2,000 discount on the retail price — so it’s safe to assume that the final unit will likely cost well into the tens-of-thousands of dollars realm. The membership also serves up access to key “experiences,” including a flight simulator, demonstrations, and other events. This is the prototype photo provided by Kitty Hawk, though the company stresses that the final vehicle will sport a different design. Above: Kitty Hawk: The “Flyer” Image Credit: Kitty Hawk Kitty Hawk represents just one of a number of startups operating in the personal flying machine fray. Larry Page is actually working on a second aviation startup, called Zee, which was founded in 2010 with a view to “designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.” It’s currently working on a “small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically,” according to a Bloomberg report. Elsewhere, Mass.-based Terrafugia has been working on prototypes of “roadable” aircraft for more than a decade. And just last week Germany’s Lilium announced the first test flight of its electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) jet, as it works toward building an on-demand air taxi service by 2025. Meanwhile, Slovakia’s AeroMobil announced preorders for a flying car, with prices starting at $1.3 million. Zunum Aero is also striving to take aviation into the future with a small electric aircraft that taps thousands of smaller regional airports to transport people up to 700 miles.   ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Silicon Valley startup Kitty Hawk, backed by Alphabet CEO and Google co-founder Larry Page, has finally launched today – and it promises its electric flying cars will be available to the masses by the end of the year. The company will be led by former X chief and Google self-driving car originator Sebastian Thrun, who earlier today took to Twitter to unveil Kitty Hawk for the first time. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT The tweet in question teased a prototype of the company’s upcoming Flyer electric aircraft, along with a link to Kitty Hawk’s website and the ambitious promise to change “the future of personal transportation.” Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype https://t.co/mbX5Z0WpTo — Sebastian Thrun (@SebastianThrun) April 24, 2017 You can catch a peek at Kitty Hawk’s futuristic single-rider Flyer in action in the video below. The footage was reportedly recorded at a lake nearby San Francisco during one of the company’s trial sessions, according to the New York Times. The NY Times further says the open-seated vehicle weighs approximately 220 pounds and packs eight battery-powered propellers (as loud as a speedboat) to soar into the air. Interestingly, the publication adds that – thanks to its lightweight design – customers will be able to fly the aircraft without the need for any special licenses under current Federal Aviation Administration regulations. But this only applies to sparsely populated areas. Despite Kitty Hawk’s goal to push the flying vehicle to market by the end of the year, pre-orders are still closed as of now. You can, however, pay a one-off fee of $100 to subscribe to Kitty Hawk as a ‘Flyer Discovery Member.’ In addition to early access to updates and upcoming demonstrations about the aircraft, the membership will also entitle you to ‘priority placement’ as well as a $2,000 discount once the Flyer actually launches. While the price is yet to be determined, you can head to Kitty Hawk’s website here for more details about the airborne single-rider. on Kitty Hawk Official Website Read next: Why the fuck is will.i.am advising this UK fintech startup?

The head of Google Cloud Diane Greene thinks that the company can overtake Amazon Web Services as the market leader by 2022. Speaking at the Forbes CIO Summit in California on Sunday, Greene, who was named SVP for Google’s cloud business in 2015, said: “I think we have a pretty good shot at being #1 in five years. “I actually think we have a huge advantage in our data centers, in our infrastructure, availability, security and how we automate things. We just haven’t packaged it up perfectly yet.” Read more: Cloud Wars: Google Cloud just made a lot of its services free to use Under Greene’s leadership, Google Cloud has made a number of acquisitions focused on making the company have a greater enterprise appeal, while also ramping up the messaging around the company’s dedication to the cloud market and restructuring the company’s portfolio in the market. In 2016 the company spent $625m to acquire Apigee. Diane Greene, SVP Google Cloud. On the subject of acquisitions, Greene spoke of the company’s push around the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence with the deals to acquire the likes of DeepMind (Jan 2014) and Kaggle in March of this year. Google’s push in these areas could help to create a competitive differentiator from the likes of AWS and Microsoft Azure, although both of these companies have their own flavours of AI and machine learning technology. Google has already had a number of notable projects using these technologies, with the likes of AXA using Google TensorFlow to better predict large-loss major traffic accidents. Asked by the audience as to how Google would compete with the market leaders, Greene said that the company would focus on its technical capabilities and pointed to the partnership with SAP as proof that its cloud offering is already starting to appeal to enterprises. Greene said: “Google is just built for having the most technology. “That’s what we’re good at, and that’s who we’ve hired.” Tags AWS Cloud Google Google Cloud Homepage News List Microsoft Azure Previous ArticleMachinations of power: unlocking success with machine learning Next ArticleBrexit and Trump fail to shift CEOs’ focus on digital growth & profits Most read Red Hat brings legacy apps back to the future with Kubernetes James Nunns 13th April 2017 Cloud wars: Oracle CEO plans to beat AWS without as many data centres Hannah Williams 13th April 2017 Accenture claims to be the biggest user of cloud & Office 365 in the world Byomakesh Biswal 12th April 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Overcome the Attacker Advantage with McAfee Endpoint Security By Intel Editor’s Pick Bluewolf CEO on cloud’s people problem & bringing the IBM tech stack to Salesforce James Nunns 20th April 2017 Exploring Antarctica with Eugene Kaspersky: From art and penguins, to the Glaciator robot Ellie Burns 18th April 2017 Open Source Hippie to Software Standard: Ubuntu CEO signs off on a decade at Canonical Ellie Burns 13th April 2017 Related News Cloud migration is essential, but it’s a marathon not a sprint James Nunns 24th April 2017 How to download from Google Drive Joe Clark 22nd April 2017 Microsoft brings IoT to the enterprise Joe Clark 21st April 2017 Latest in 4th Revolution 4th Revolution The Connected Factory: How manufacturers can ride the current wave of uncertainty Ellie Burns 21st April 2017 Internet of Things Baidu open sources autonomous driving with Project Apollo Hannah Williams 19th April 2017 4th Revolution Hands-free umbrella and dog nanny – Ford blueprints for futuristic drones revealed Ellie Burns 18th April 2017 Latest in Analysis Why a 3D David Attenborough points to a Planet Earth driven by virtual customer experience Ellie Burns 20th April 2017 Exploring Antarctica with Eugene Kaspersky: From art and penguins, to the Glaciator robot Ellie Burns 18th April 2017 Register to Vote Cyber Attack: Who Hacked Brexit?

What is a chatbot? What is a chatbot? They come in two flavors: Virtual assistants, which help you find information, remember stuff, or buy things. Think Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google’s Assistant. These are powered by machine learning, meaning they rely on artificial intelligence to learn and figure out what you want. Messaging apps, which essentially allow businesses and brands to be online 24/7 providing customer support (e.g., instant responses, quick answers, complaint resolution). Think Facebook Messenger, Kik, WeChat, and Slack. These types of chatbots are only capable of interacting with users by following pre-programmed rules. What you see and experienced so far is just the beginning of what is forecast to be a billion-dollar industry in less than 10 years. Many top brands, including Uber, Sephora, and CNN, have already adopted chatbots. Here are 11 amazing facts you might not know about chatbots. Fact 1: 1.4 Billion People Use Messaging Apps The top four messaging apps are bigger than the top four social networks, according to BI Intelligence. More than 1.4 billion people used messaging apps in 2016, according to eMarketer. By 2019, more than 25 percent of the world’s population (roughly 1.75 billion people) will be using mobile messaging apps. Fact 2: People Are Ready to Talk to Chatbots According to a report (Humanity in the Machine) from media and marketing services company Mindshare, 63 percent of people would consider messaging an online chatbot to communicate with a business or brand. A survey conducted by myclever Agency found that they would use chatbots to obtain “quick emergency answers.” Fact 3: People Want to Contact Retailers via Chat Online chat and messaging apps are the preferred way for 29 percent of people to contact retailers when making a purchase decision, according to [24]7. That means people are equally likely to contact a retailer by phone or use a chatbot and more likely to use a chatbot than to contact a retailer via email (27 percent). Fact 4: There Are More than 30,000 Facebook Chatbots As of September, there were 30,000 chatbots on Facebook. Those chatbots have been used by millions of people in 200 countries. Fact 5: Most Chatbot Conversations Start With “Hi” “Hi” and “hello” are the two most popular ways to start a conversation with a chatbot, according to Dashbot.io, a bot analytics provider. Other popular messages included a question mark, “hey,” “help,” “yes,” and a thumbs up icon. Fact 6: Consumers Are Ready to Buy Things via Chatbots Thirty-seven percent of Americans say they are willing to make a purchase through a chatbot, according to DigitasLBi. On average, consumers would spend more than $55 per purchase. If a chatbot were available, 33 percent of UK residents would buy basic items like clothes and food, according to myclever Agency Fact 7: Consumers Won’t Put Up With Bad Chatbots One bad chatbot experience could be costly. According to the DigitasLBi report, 73 percent of Americans said they wouldn’t use a company’s chatbot after a bad experience. According to Mindshare’s report, 61 percent of people would find it more frustrating if a chatbot couldn’t solve a problem vs. a human. Fact 8: Consumers Want Recommendations From Chatbots Thirty-seven percent of all consumers — and 48 percent of millennials — are open to receiving recommendations or advice from chatbots, according to DigitasLBi. Breaking this down further, consumers are interested in recommendations for products from retail stores (22 percent); hotels/accommodations (20 percent); travel (18 percent); products from a pharmacy (12 percent); and fashion/style (9 percent). Fact 9: Don’t Blur Lines Between Bots, Humans An overwhelming majority of consumers (75 percent) said they want to know whether they are chatting with a chatbot or a human (48 percent considered chatbots pretending to be human “creepy”), according to Mindshare. The robotic and artificial nature of responses clued in 60 percent consumers that they were interacting with a chatbot, according to DigitasLBi. Fact 10: Chatbots Will Be Indistinguishable From Humans by 2029 Ray Kurzweil, an inventor, futurist, and engineer at Google (who has a pretty good knack for making accurate predictions) predicts that chatbots will have human-level language ability by the year 2029. “If you think you can have a meaningful conversation with a human, you’ll be able to have a meaningful conversation with an AI in 2029. But you’ll be able to have interesting conversations before that,” according to Kurzweil, as quoted in The Verge. Fact 11: People in China Seriously Love Chatbots Xiaoice is a ridiculously popular chatbot in China, according to Engadget. The average conversation length is 23 conversations per session (CPS). The average CPS for pretty much every other chatbot: 1.5 to 2.5. Bonus fact: Pretty soon chatbots will be ridiculously popular in the U.S. as well. Are you ready for the amazing chatbot revolution?

A grand jury on Friday charged 53-year-old Robert Arias in a 26-count indictment with possessing and distributing child porn. Arias, who was convicted in 2006 of similar charges and required to register as a sex offender, is set for a Wednesday arraignment. Arias has been jailed on $100,000 bond since April 14. Google sent a tip to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, who in turn went to the Ohio Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, in February that someone had uploaded a photograph of a nude child to a Google service, according to court records. Investigators tracked the IP address to Arias' Seneca Boulevard apartment. During an April 14 search of the apartment they found hundreds of files of child pornography, including the picture flagged by Google, on cellphones, mobile devices and a laptop, records say. Children in the photographs that Arias possessed ranged in age from 2 years old to 9 years old, prosecutors say. The 7-year-old boy whom he photographed was well-known to him, prosecutors say. Arias admitted to investigators during the search to possessing child porn, the records say. Arias was sentenced to four years in prison in 2006 after he pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography.  He was also convicted last year of failing to register a new address. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley in a news release Monday morning said called Arias a "sexual predator" who has escalated to grooming young children. "This indictment demonstrates that we will not tolerate this in our community," O'Malley said.

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 46 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response?

A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager.

Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. Tuesday's update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or "getting lost." advertisement | advertise on newsday With the update, Google Earth now works on Google's Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there's no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Some older features will still require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook's Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares202 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezelless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen-to-body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8 or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold on to it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that are specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on your phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode. Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is an all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart MJ Yeah, it's just horrible here so don't believe anything you hear and certainly don't waste your time immigrating here. whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe it is a defect, I don't know. If I got a pink one, I'd return it. I wouldn't accept a software update. I'm also wondering if at least some of the people who think they have pink displays simply have the blue filter turned on. 4Ui812 The blue filter shouldn't be causing that sort of issue. Hell the blue filter on my s7e doesn't make that much of a difference. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue.

EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS!

Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off. Rest of the settings are stock out of the box. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d6d107fe72843084747728a2ff7d6ed0c69dbb8828498d680a8e574909c8d80.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/69216e0f531ae12996c1fea6d785844e4b1d5cb6f74e5a1f1b39973b6d6f25d5.png LineOS for exynos! They will never learn how to make it smooth! I give up.. s7e here on lineage os.. The only way is to build tw from the base.. take lineage and build on it.. avnow I'd be good if the edge screen has more functionality in these new flagships Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back." The very first Android phone, the G1, had the buttons in this order: Phone - Home - Trackball - Back - Hangup/Power So the back button was originally on the right. MANOJ Galaxy S8 seems to be promising device from South Korean manufacturer. Hope Samsung have learned from the mistakes, they had done last time with note series.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About April 25, 2017 Neural Networks: You’ve Got It So Easy 18 Comments by: Steven Dufresne April 24, 2017 Neural networks are all the rage right now with increasing numbers of hackers, students, researchers, and businesses getting involved. The last resurgence was in the 80s and 90s, when there was little or no World Wide Web and few neural network tools. The current resurgence started around 2006. From a hacker’s perspective, what tools and other resources were available back then, what’s available now, and what should we expect for the future? For myself, a GPU on the Raspberry Pi would be nice. The 80s and 90s Neural network 80s/90s books and mags For the young’uns reading this who wonder how us old geezers managed to do anything before the World Wide Web, hardcopy magazines played a big part in making us aware of new things. And so it was Scientific American magazine’s September 1992 special issue on Mind and Brain that introduced me to neural networks, both the biological and artificial kinds. Back then you had the option of writing your own neural networks from scratch or ordering source code from someone else, which you’d receive on a floppy diskette in the mail. I even ordered a floppy from The Amateur Scientist column of that Scientific American issue. You could also buy a neural network library that would do all the low-level, complex math for you.  There was also a free simulator called Xerion from the University of Toronto. Keeping an eye on the bookstore Science sections did turn up the occasional book on the subject. The classic was the two-volume Explorations in Parallel Distributed Processing, by Rumelhart, McClelland et al. A favorite of mine was Neural Computation and Self-Organizing Maps: An Introduction, useful if you were interested in neural networks controlling a robot arm. There were also short courses and conferences you could attend. The conference I attended in 1994 was a free two-day one put on by Geoffrey Hinton, then of the University of Toronto, both then and now a leader in the field. The best reputed annual conference at the time was the Neural Information Processing System conference, still going strong today. And lastly, I recall combing the libraries for published papers. My stack of conference papers and course handouts, photocopied articles, and handwritten notes from that period is around 3″ thick. Then things went relatively quiet. While neural networks had found use in a few applications, they hadn’t lived up to their hype and from the perspective of the world, outside of a limited research community, they ceased to matter. Things remained quiet as gradual improvements were made, along with a few breakthroughs, and then finally around 2006 they exploded on the world again. The Present Arrives We’re focusing on tools here but briefly, those breakthroughs were mainly: new techniques for training networks that go more than three or four layers deep, now called deep neural networks the use of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to speed up training the availability of training data containing large numbers of samples Neural Network Frameworks There are now numerous neural network libraries, usually called frameworks, available for download for free with various licenses, many of them open source frameworks. Most of the more popular ones allow you to run your neural networks on GPUs, and are flexible enough to support most types of networks. Here are most of the more popular ones. They all have GPU support except for FNN. TensorFlow Languages: Python, C++ is in the works TensorFlow is Google’s latest neural network framework. It’s designed for distributing networks across multiple machines and GPUs. It can be considered a low-level one, offering great flexibility but also a larger learning curve than high-level ones like Keras and TFLearn, both talked about below. However, they are working on producing a version of Keras integrated in TensorFlow. We’ve seen this one in a hack on Hackaday already in this hammer and beer bottle recognizing robot and even have an introduction to using TensorFlow. Theano Languages: Python This is an open source library for doing efficient numerical computations involving multi-dimensional arrays. It’s from the University of Montreal, and runs on Windows, Linux and OS-X. Theano has been around for a long time, 0.1 having been released in 2009. Caffe Languages: Command line, Python, and MATLAB Caffe is developed by Berkeley AI Research and community contributors. Models can be defined in a plain text file and then processed using a command line tool. There are also Python and MATLAB interfaces. For example, you can define your model in a plain text file, give details on how to train it in a second plain text file called a solver, and then pass these to the caffe command line tool which will then train a neural network. You can then load this trained net using a Python program and use it to do something, image classification for example. CNTK Languages: Python, C++, C# This is the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) and runs on Windows and Linux. They’re currently working on a version to be used with Keras. Keras Languages: Python Written in Python, Keras uses either TensorFlow or Theano underneath, making it easier to use those frameworks. There are also plans to support CNTK as well. Work is underway to integrate Keras into TensorFlow resulting in a separate TensorFlow-only version of Keras. TF Learn Languages: Python Like Keras, this is a high-level library built on top of TensorFlow. FANN Languages: Supports over 15 languages, no GPU support This is a high-level open source library written in C. It’s limited to fully connected and sparsely connected neural networks. However, it’s been popular over the years, and has even been included in Linux distributions. It’s recently shown up here on Hackaday in a robot that learned to walk using reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique that often makes use of neural networks. Torch Languages: Lua Open source library written in C. Interestingly, they say on the front page of their website that Torch is embeddable, with ports to iOS, Andoid and FPGA backends. PyTorch Languages: Python PyTorch is relatively new, their website says it’s in early-release beta, but there seems to be a lot interest in it. It runs on Linux and OS-X and uses Torch underneath. There are no doubt others that I’ve missed. If you have a particular favorite that’s not here then please let us know in the comments. Which one should you use? Unless the programming language or OS is an issue then another factor to keep in mind is your skill level. If you’re uncomfortable with math or don’t want to dig deeply into the neural network’s nuances then chose a high-level one. In that case, stay away from TensorFlow, where you have to learn more about the API than Kera, TFLearn or the other high-level ones. Frameworks that emphasize their math functionality usually require you to do more work to create the network. Another factor is whether or not you’ll be doing basic research. A high-level framework may not allow you to access the innards enough to start making crazy networks, perhaps with connections spanning multiple layers or within layers, and with data flowing in all directions. Online Services Are you you’re looking to add something a neural network would offer to your hack but don’t want to take the time to learn the intricacies of neural networks? For that there are services available by connecting your hack to the internet. We’ve seen countless examples making use of Amazon’s Alexa for voice recognition. Google also has its Cloud Machine Learning Services which includes vision and speech. Its vision service have shown up here using Raspberry Pi’s for candy sorting and reading human emotions. The Wekinator is aimed at artists and musicians that we’ve seen used to train a neural network to respond to various gestures for turning things on an off around the house, as well as for making a virtual world’s tiniest violin. Not to be left out, Microsoft also has its Cognitive Services APIs, including: vision, speech, language and others. GPUs and TPUs Iterating through a neural network Training a neural network requires iterating through the neural network, forward and then backward, each time improving the network’s accuracy. Up to a point, the more iterations you can do, the better the final accuracy will be when you stop. The number of iterations could be in the hundreds or even thousands. With 1980s and 1990s computers, achieving enough iterations could take an unacceptable amount of time. According to the article, Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview, in 2004 an increase of 20 times the speed was achieved with a GPU for a fully connected neural network. In 2006 a 4 times increase was achieved for a convolutional neural network. By 2010, increases were as much as 50 times faster when comparing training on a CPU versus a GPU. As a result, accuracies were much higher. Nvidia Titan Xp graphics card. Image Credit: Nvidia How do GPUs help? A big part of training a neural network involves doing matrix multiplication, something which is done much faster on a GPU than on a CPU. Nvidia, a leader in making graphics cards and GPUs, created an API called CUDA which is used by neural network software to make use of the GPU. We point this out because you’ll see the term CUDA a lot. With the spread of deep learning, Nvidia has added more APIs, including CuDNN (CUDA for Deep Neural Networks), a library of finely tuned neural network primitives, and another term you’ll see. Nvidia also has its own single board computer, the Jetson TX2, designed to be the brains for self-driving cars, selfie-snapping drones, and so on. However, as our [Brian Benchoff] has pointed out, the price point is a little high for the average hacker. Google has also been working on its own hardware acceleration in the form of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). You might have noticed the similarity to the name of Google’s framework above, TensorFlow. TensorFlow makes heavy use of tensors (think of single and multi-dimensional arrays in software). According to Google’s paper on the TPU it’s designed for the inference phase of neural networks. Inference refers not to training neural networks but to using the neural network after it’s been trained. We haven’t seen it used by any frameworks yet, but it’s something to keep in mind. Using Other People’s Hardware Do you have a neural network that’ll take a long time to train but don’t have a supported GPU, or don’t want to tie up your resources? In that case there’s hardware you can use on other machines accessible over the internet. One such is FloydHub which, for an individual, costs only penny’s per hour with no monthly payment. Another is Amazon EC2. Datasets Training neural network with labeled data We said that one of the breakthroughs in neural networks was the availability of training data containing large numbers of samples, in the tens of thousands. Training a neural network using a supervised training algorithm involves giving the data to the network at its inputs but also telling it what the expected output should be. In that case the data also has to be labeled. If you give an image of a horse to the network’s inputs, and its outputs say it looks like a cheetah, then it needs to know that the error is large and more training is needed. The expected output is called a label, and the data is ‘labeled data’. Many such datasets are available online for training purposes. MNIST is one such for handwritten character recognition. ImageNet and CIFAR are two different datasets of labeled images. Many more are listed on this Wikipedia page. Many of the frameworks listed above have tutorials that include the necessary datasets. That’s not to say you absolutely need a large dataset to get a respectable accuracy. The walking robot we previously mentioned that used the FNN framework, used the servo motor positions as its training data. Other Resources Unlike in the 80s and 90s, while you can still buy hardcopy books about neural networks, there are numerous ones online. Two online books I’ve enjoyed are Deep Learning by the MIT Press and Neural Networks and Deep Learning. The above listed frameworks all have tutorials to help get started. And then there are countless other websites and YouTube videos on any topic you search for. I find YouTube videos of recorded lectures and conference talks very useful. The Future Raspberry Pi 7 with GPU Doubtless the future will see more frameworks coming along. We’ve long seen specialized neural chips and boards on the market but none have ever found a big market, even back in the 90s. However, those aren’t designed specially for serving the real growth area, the neural network software that everyone’s working on. GPUs do serve that market. As neural networks with millions of connections for image and voice processing, language, and so on make their way into smaller and smaller consumer devices the need for more GPUs or processors tailored to that software will hopefully result in something that can become a new component on a Raspberry Pi or Arduino board. Though there is the possibility that processing will remain an online service instead. EDIT: It turns out there is a GPU on the Raspberry Pi — see the comments below. That doesn’t mean all the above frameworks will make use of it though. For example, TensorFlow supports Nvidia CUDA cards only. But you can still use the GPU for your own custom neural network code. Various links are in the comments for that too. There is already competition for GPUs from ASICs like the TPU and it’s possible we’ll see more of those, possibly ousting GPUs from neural networks altogether. As for our new computer overlord, neural networks as a part of our daily life are here to stay this time, but the hype that is artificial general intelligence will likely quieten until someone makes significant breaktroughs only to explode onto the scene once again, but for real this time. In the meantime, which neural network framework have you used and why? Or did you write your own? Are there any tools missing that you’d like to see? Let us know in the comments below.

Report comment Reply dcfusor2015 says: April 24, 2017 at 8:10 am Back in the day, I found Timothy Masters’ books to be most informative and pleasant to read – he’s that most unusual combination of a mathematician who can also write English – and C++. He correctly predicted/diagnosed all the current complaints about NN’s back in the early 90’s, which are now being brought up due to failing to follow his advice and guidlines from “way back when”. Such as “don’t go too deep until you prove you need to” – we now have deep learning as the rage which is often fooled by the simplest noise. “Use high precision math to find the error gradient when it’s flat” – so now we have (in order to promote the often misused “deep doo doo, or um, learning”) reduced precision floats. I just have to laugh, this is yet another case of the new guys being unaware of what went before, re-inventing the wheel (and of course, taking credit), and missing what has been learned already with great effort. Guess what – things still work the same as ever. “Practical Neural Network Recipes in C++” ISBN 0-12-479040-2 The basics of MLFF neural nets, as well as Kohonen and others, with history, tips, and working code. “Signal and Image Processing with Neural Networks, a C++ sourcebook” where Timothy extends NN theory to the complex number domain (also with source code). ISBN 0-471-04963-8 Both by Timothy Masters (who also has a web site, but links here take too long to post). Now you *really* have it easy. The first book is actually fun to read… Resubmitted with this change as wordpress login is hosed and thinks this is already posted, but it isn’t.

Us truly old geezers know that the 80s and 90s were actually the second resurgence of artificial neural networks. The first started with the invention of Perceptrons in the late 50s: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron Report comment Reply Equality says: April 24, 2017 at 1:15 pm The reason for the cycles: 1. A new generation comes up, reads about the past, and wonders “why didn’t they ever finish this? Must not have been good enough technology at the time…” begins work on it, starts a new fad. 2. New fad generates lots of new ideas, propels the science even further 3. Giant corporations buy up the Intellectual Property rights to those ideas, then quash them because they can’t be easily used to force mass wealth transfer while violating consumers dignity. 4. Innovators and inventors go broke and can no longer pay for food and shelter 5. ideas and motivation to the few survivors languish for a few years 6. Back to step one.

It was my HAD in the 80s. TAB books had an “electronics book club” advertised in it. One of those $4.95 for your first 5 books then every month another book would show up that you could return if you didnt want it but youd end up paying for it because it was easier than returning….like the .99c cd clubs. Well one month in my package contained “Experiments in Artificial Neural Networks” by Edward Rietman 1988…I must admit that at 14 it was beyond my skillset or interest so I returned it. But thats the first time I had any exposure to the concept….for historical reference.

Well, it seems that ranking boost isn't going to get any stronger. Gary Illyes from Google said on Twitter that Google has no plans to increase the weight of the HTTPS ranking boost, more than it already is. He said "we revisited the idea a few months back but we decided against it." Here is Gary's tweet: @dr_pete No. We revisited the idea a few months back but we decided against it.— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) April 21, 2017 Google denied previous allegations that they increased the weight of the HTTPS signal in the past as well. Keep in mind, there are now estimates that 50% of Google's search results have HTTPS URLs in them. Going HTTPS is not a bad thing and Google is pretty good at migrating all the ranking signals when you move. But if you mess up, it can be pretty bad for your rankings. So be careful.

Home > Google News > Google Tests Dropping AMP Logo From Search Results Google Tests Dropping AMP Logo From Search Results Apr 24, 2017 • 8:13 am | (50) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story When Google took AMP live in their search results, they were accompanied by the AMP logo in the search results snippets. First that logo was a green color and then soon after they muted the logo to a dull gray AMP icon. Now Google may be testing removing the AMP logo completely from the search results. Sergey Alakov spotted an example of Google showing a URL that went to an AMP page but there was no logo in the search results listings in Google. Here is an animated GIF of the AMP logo showing in one case but gone in the other case for the same query and same URL. The last snippet, you will see the AMP logo there and then gone: It wouldn't surprise me if Google is testing not showing the AMP logo in the search results. I mean, they use to have a mobile friendly label until they dropped that label over time. I personally wouldn't mind if the AMP logo went away. Forum discussion at Twitter. Update: A Google spokesperson said "as you know we do tens of thousands of experiments in search every year but there are no such plans at this moment to change anything. The logo tells users that the page they will open will do so reliably and consistently fast."

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos TheTape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsWill Google Be The First To Achieve Quantum Computing Supremacy? Will Google Be The First To Achieve Quantum Computing Supremacy? The search giant has designed a qubit chip that is now ready for testing. April 24, 2017 WSP For more than seven years (starting in 2009), Google has been collaborating with D-Wave Systems, a Canadian tech startup which at the time claimed to be the first company to produce a commercial quantum computer. In 2013, Google even bought D-Wave Two, one of D-Wave’s machines. Sadly, a number of tests  published in 2014 debunked D-Wave’s claims — their machines were not doing any better than traditional computers because they did not seem to be using quantum physics to solve problems and run computations. Or simply, their  machines weren’t quantum computers at all. It was in that same year when University of California professor John Martinis joined Google to establish a quantum hardware lab in Santa Barbara. His mission was to develop his own versions of the kind of chip being used inside a D-Wave machine. In other words, he was tasked to make improvements on D-Wave’s hardware based on the premise that their chip had the kind of quantum physics needed to do quantum computing, it just wasn’t working the right way to deliver the superior computational power that a quantum computer is supposedly capable of. Three years later, Martinis has given himself a clear deadline: he says that by the end of 2017, his team will be the first to achieve ‘quantum supremacy’, meaning, they will be able to build the first true quantum computer. And his confidence stems from the fact that they are now ready to test the quantum chip they have been working on for the past few years. As reported by the MIT Technology Review, Google’s quantum chip has 6 qubits arranged in a 2 by 3 configuration which, according to Martinis, shows that the technology will work when the qubits are arranged side by side as they will need to be in bigger devices. The use of qubits (short for quantum bits) is what makes the high speed computational power of quantum computers possible. Conventional computers process data through bits which can represent 0 or 1. Quantum computers, on the other hand, process data by using qubits that can represent 0, or 1, or 0 and 1 simultaneously through the bizarre quantum process known as superpositioning or the ability of being in two different states at once. Aside from showing its feasibility for large scale application, Google’s 6-qubit arrangement is also a test to show if initially using one chip to store the qubits and another chip for the wiring that controls the qubits before eventually ‘bump bonding’ them together will work. Apparently, the results are positive. Which is why the team is now moving fast forward. According to Martinis, their quantum supremacy experiment would require a 49-qubit grid. And they are now in the process of designing 30 – 50 qubit devices for this purpose. Pulling off this experiment of making a 50-qubit device actually perform quantum computations is a giant leap that will push Google to the forefront of the race to build the first quantum computer. Make no mistake about it, if successful, this will be a giant step forward. That said however, the finish line is still quite far off and there’s much more work that needs to be done. Still, a step forward is always a welcome development. And everyone at Google (and probably even the rest of the scientific community) is excited about the prospect of witnessing the realization of a technology that has so far been elusive and one which could fundamentally alter the way our society operates.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MARKETING Google adds TV inventory to DoubleClick Bid Manager so advertisers can measure video campaigns across linear and digital Paul Sawers@psawers April 24, 2017 5:40 AM Image Credit: ofcom.org.uk With viewing habits shifting from the living room environment to multiple online platforms spread throughout the house and elsewhere, broadcasters and advertisers face a unique set of challenges in their efforts to capture consumers’ attention across screens. In recognition of this hurdle, Google is now adding traditional TV inventory to its DoubleClick Bid Manager platform in the U.S. DoubleClick, for the uninitiated, is Google’s ad-serving subsidiary that gives agencies and media companies the tools to target and track their online ad campaigns. DoubleClick Bid Manager is where advertisers can control their programmatic ad purchasing, creating and measuring campaigns across desktop, mobile, and video from a centralized dashboard. For its latest initiative, Google is integrating with Wideorbit and Clypd, two adtech platforms that work with cable networks and TV stations, as well as its own Google Fiber service, to serve access to “national, local, and even addressable” TV inventory through DoubleClick Bid Manager. “As the lines blur between TV and digital video, it’s important that marketers are able to reach their audiences across screens,” explained Rany Ng, director for product management at Google, in a blog post. In effect, this means that advertisers are better able to manage their video campaigns across “linear” TV and digital TV, pulling everything together into a single platform. For example, an advertiser will now be able to see the result of broadcasting its ad on TV and can connect the dots with any associated online search and digital activity, such as consumers Googling for a product they see on TV or watching a product demo video on YouTube. Through DoubleClick Bid Manager, advertisers can track all of the activity to help inform decisions around future ad purchases and to generally stay better-informed around their ad spend. “Historically, TV and digital advertising have been bought and measured through different systems and currencies,” added Ng. “By adding traditional TV buying into DoubleClick Bid Manager, we are taking the first step toward allowing advertisers and agencies to manage their video campaigns across digital and linear TV, in a more efficient and effective way.” Today’s news comes a day after a new Accenture study revealed that computers have overtaken TVs as the preferred devices for watching TV shows, with just 23 percent of people now preferring to watch shows on a physical TV — down from 55 percent on the previous year.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares208 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. Scott Breitbach How is '60s surf music going to help a ghost problem? Scott Breitbach Or were they the '60s R&B guys? kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Đức Thành I guess you missed the part where I said 6 smart home devices weren't any where near enough. Bring me 16 and we're talking. :D Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? SavageJeep Oh, god. People are buying none of these cutting edge technological products. Are they poor or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library. Paul Quinn I can access a single song, an album, any of my playlists, or a Google Music Playlist. I can access music from my library or from Play Music's entire catalog. I am subscribed to Google Play Music. It's possible you are seeing this if you do not have a subscription. However, you should be able to access Google's curated lists. Michael I do have the subscription. I find this really odd. Can you verify you are able to play a song that exists only in your library and not available from Play Music? How did you ask for it to be played? I have a song in my library called Alligator.MP3 as well as many others and she cannot play it. There is an entire thread on this feature not being available so I would really appreciate it if you can double check. Thanks https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/googlehome/zC9dUi3FUsk/3W6KPacnAgAJ Paul Quinn I stand corrected! It is difficult to find songs only in my library and not in GP's library but I found a couple and it will not play them on the Home. That link in the product forum has an answer that says it should work. Am I reading that wrong? It's marked as "Best Answer." Michael Well, it should work if/when Google supports it. The bad thing is they are completely mum on the subject and won't really commit on it. People who report it are being given the old "we'll send your feedback to to the developers​.". Every other Android device works as we expect it to but not Home. It will only play your playlists and that doesn't depend on the subscription. Julie Ankrom I'm seeing a niche service here, where you buy one or more "friends" and they respond to you via a particular Google Home. You can say, "Max, what do you think of the Reds this season?" or even "Everyone, what are you doing today?" and get responses. Going somewhere? Take your Google Home "friend" with you. Google home "friend parties"! Watch TV shows or movies with your "friends". A stay at home job for the "friends" and a whole new industry. Anthony DeRobertis Well, if you've got a Opera Ghost haunting your house, you'd best keep box five empty. I hear the chandeliers will start falling on you if you don't ☺. Odd it doesn't work—it seems to mostly work (in a not so great way) with assistant on a phone (normally, I ask the phone to text someone, and Google Home interrupts and announces it can't text yet—thanks, Google). It works with Echos, though. I have a bunch of Echos and Echo Dots, and (ever since the update that added it), I've never had multiple ones respond. It's not always the closest one that responds (especially if the closest one has a bunch of background noise nearby), but never more than one. I don't even have all the Echos on the same access point (though they're all on the same network). Google Home seems better at answering random questions than Echo, I just wish Google were as good as Amazon at making a product actually work (and that's not asking for much). Google Home has a lot more false activations than the Echos, too (though I think the Echos have now erred too far on that side, and sometimes I have to yell at them to activate them.) F4LL0U7 Could you avoid all of that (and save hundreds of dollars) by saying "OK Google" to your phone or your watch, if you have a smart watch? Todd Yates A phone will not hear you properly from across the room or even in your pocket, and neither will you hear its response. It's really not comparable at all. F4LL0U7 To each his own, of course. I just think it's worth it to save the $130, and just take my phone out of my pocket if I need to use voice commands. Paul Quinn There are more benefits to the Home beyond what a phone can do. Namely, the fact that it is a very good speaker for music. I also use it for news and podcasts. Sure, I could use my phone but that drains the battery. It also assumes I am carrying my phone with me from room to room in my home. It's usually sitting on a table somewhere when I'm home. But - if you don't have any smart home gear and don't listen to music other than with headphones, the Home is probably much less of a tool.

Mark Walton (UK) - Apr 24, 2017 12:46 pm UTC Enlarge reader comments 101 Share this story Google has announced a series of workshops designed to apparently tackle the spread of online hate speech and fake news. The "Internet Citizens" workshops aimed at teenagers are intended to promote "tolerance" and "empathy" and to raise "awareness" of the plethora of social issues that plague online communities. It's promised that the workshops—hosted by YouTubers Nadir Nahdi, Alain Clapham, and Efe Ezekiel and created with the advice of the Metropolitan Police and the Active Change Foundation—will teach teens how to deal with offensive speech, flag inappropriate content, and moderate comments. Google will also note how to spot fake news and (because this is Google, after all) use online video services like YouTube to increase diversity. The Internet Citizens programme launches in Liverpool and will visit youth clubs across the country in the coming months, Google said. Google's workshops come in response to a storm of criticism over YouTube's restricted mode, which censored some LGBTQ+ content. The mode—which screens out "potentially mature content that you may prefer not to see or don't want others in your family to see"—is off by default but removed some content with LGBTQ+ themes and videos affiliated with LGBTQ+ YouTubers. Further ReadingFacebook—in hate crime clash with MPs—claims it’s “fixed” abuse review tool Hashtags #YoutubeIsOverParty and #YoutubePartyIsOver quickly trended on Twitter, before YouTube tweeted that "some videos have been incorrectly labelled and that's not right. We're on it." Google recently came under fire in the UK after government-funded advertising appeared in front of extremist videos on YouTube. The ads were later removed. In a report by The Times, several extremist creators even received payouts for the ads that ran on their channels, which the government said included "rape apologists, anti-Semites, and banned hate preachers." Further ReadingUK government suspends YouTube ads after some appear on extremist videos Politicians have become been increasingly involved in criticising the spread of hate speech and offensive content online. In March, MPs clashed with Facebook over a BBC investigation that highlighted how easily obscene material could be found on the free content ad network. Over the weekend, the European Union was reportedly considering legislative measures to unify how the likes of Google, Twitter, and Facebook remove hate speech. In a draft policy paper seen by Reuters, the European Commission apparently said there is a "high degree of variation in the approaches taken to removal of illegal content—be it incitement to terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse material, or infringements of intellectual property rights. Such divergences may be justified in some cases (e.g. for certain types of illegal content); but in other cases they reduce the effectiveness of the system (e.g. by delaying the removal of terrorist propaganda)." A UK cross-government meeting on "cyber hate" was due to be held in June, but thanks to Theresa May's surprise General Election it has now been postponed until a later date.

Buy Now GOOGLE STREET VIEW Ruth Smith, a children's librarian with two young kids, got a lot of notoriety out of the gesture she made toward the Governor's Mansion in 2011.  RUTH SMITH PHOTO Ruth Smith and her husband Tim Meehan. RUTH SMITH PHOTO Ruth Smith doesn't regret her 2011 gesture immortalized for the time-being on Google Earth, but says, "What I did was pretty crude, and it doesn't help anything." Timing is everything. Ruth Smith was running her regular route from her Tenney Park home, through Maple Bluff, and past the Governor’s Mansion. It was June 2011, during the passionate Act 10 protests, and Smith admits part of her routine was “giving the bird” in the direction of the Executive Residence. “If I was going to run directly by the mansion, I did make a habit of calling out or expressing my frustration vocally, and I guess also by gestures,” Smith says now. That day, she noticed a small, white car coming toward her with what looked like a tripod and camera mounted on top. She guessed it was the Google car capturing street views, and decided to hold her gesture “a little higher and a little longer.” She went home and told her husband the humorous story, but said she honestly thought Google would edit her out. Smith checked the Google Street View of the Executive Residence online for a couple of weeks to see whether she made it in, but later forgot about it. Then, early this year, a friend of Smith’s, who’s also a runner, posted a story on Facebook from the student-run Badger Herald with the Google Street View image of a mystery woman with her finger extended and face blurred, and wrote, “I wish this were me, but sadly, it’s not.” The headline was: “Woman gives Governor’s Mansion middle finger, is crowned hero of Google Earth.” Smith said she didn’t even need to open up the story. She knew it was her. The Google Street View can be accessed here: https://www.instantstreetview.com/@43.108993,-89.36828,286.53h,-16.81p,0.45z The story ended by saying, “If anyone knows this person please contact The Badger Herald staff immediately so she can receive an award.” Smith, who moved to Colorado with her husband and two daughters in 2014, and works at the Boulder Public Library, plays down her actions. “Being a children’s librarian and having two young kids, what I did was pretty crude, and it doesn’t help anything,” she said. “It doesn’t invite conversation. And it doesn’t solve any problems.” Still, Smith is glad the story has been a source of humor and entertainment. “It’s important to have those releases and that kind of laughter during this time of frustration.” Almost two dozen of Smith’s friends posted the Badger Herald article about her gesture or another from the website mashable.com on her Facebook page. One friend called her an icon. Another said: “cyber disobedience, I love it.” Smith said she’s not the only person to run by the mansion and flip the bird. While she gained some notoriety, the real credit goes to those who are fighting Walker’s policies, and pushing back against what is now playing out at the federal level, Smith said. “I want to make sure that people who are really on the forefront, on the front lines fighting for justice for all, every day, are the people who really get that title,” she said about the label “hero.” Christian Schneider, a columnist for the Journal Sentinel, blogged about Smith’s act in 2014 before her identity was discovered, saying “she evidently decided to use (the Google) technology to give her tantrum everlasting life.” Smith, in a recent phone conversation, objected to Schneider’s use of the word tantrum. “I was thinking, ‘Dude, if you have kids, you will know that’s not a tantrum,’ ” she said, joking. Meanwhile, Tom Evenson, a spokesman for Gov. Scott Walker, reacted to Smith’s gesture in an email, by saying, “Thankfully, the majority of voters feel differently as they’ve given him the thumbs up in three elections for governor.” Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Enable Google Smart Lock The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have oddly positioned fingerprint scanners, but look a bit deeper into your settings to find another option to help keep you phone safely unlocked. By Matthew Miller for Smartphones and Cell Phones | April 24, 2017 -- 12:47 GMT (05:47 PDT) | Topic: Mobility ZDNet's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes posted an article on Friday asserting that the Samsung Galaxy S8 has a major design flaw. He included statements from reviewers across the internet who universally lament the placement of the fingerprint sensor. samsung galaxy S8 Samsung's near-perfect comeback leaves competitors in the dust 11 reasons why Galaxy S8 is better than iPhone 7 for business Galaxy S8 does DeX: Is it a Chromebook challenger or virtual desktop play? Android flagships: Which is best for the enterprise? Samsung confirms Galaxy S8 red display issue Samsung blocks ability to remap Galaxy S8's Bixby button After spending more than two weeks with the Galaxy S8 Plus, I can confirm the fingerprint sensor is not positioned in the best location and often makes unlocking the Galaxy S8 an exercise in frustation. Adrian brought up a good point about regular fingerprint failures and the process to unlock causing an impact on productivity. You could also try the iris scanner, which is secure and works well most of the time. But while it works OK for me, I'm not a real fan of having to hold my phone up so high in front of my face when I am on the train or walking around the city. I feel self-conscious doing it, as if I am taking lots of selfies or photos of those sitting across from me when I hold my phone up in this manner. Thankfully, Google includes another option for Android smartphone owners. Given my frustrations with the current S8, I dove into my settings to further explore and enable Google Smart Lock. I highly recommend you check out Google Smart Lock on your Galaxy S8, as there are several options for using the technology in your phone to enable a more intelligent locking process. Keep in mind, these Smart Lock options may reduce the level of security as they offer different strategies to keep your phone in an unlocked phase. The most secure approach is to always lock your phone, but for many of us who use our phones as a vital tool we rarely let it out of our sight and don't need to lock it every single time we are not actively using it. On-body detection This is one option I have never tried before and may also be the least secure Smart Lock option. After enabling this mode, your phone will remain unlocked while you hold it or carry it with you. If your phone is with you and unlocked and then is stolen without being set down, the thief may get full access to your phone. I'm curious to hear of other experiences with this mode to find out how well it does at remaining unlocked while being carried in your pocket. Can Android really determine when you are carrying it or when you happen to lay down with it in your pocket while still carrying it? I will have to test out this mode more before giving up other methods of securing my device. Trusted places When you select this option, your Android phone opens Google Maps and lets you select places to add as "safe zones" where your phone will remain unlocked. I currently only have my house selected as a trusted place. When you add a trusted place, your device should remain unlocked within a radius of up to 80 meters from that designated location. Trusted devices I've used this mode in the past with Android Wear watches and now have it setup to work with my Samsung Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch. Trusted devices include devices connected via Bluetooth and also NFC tags that you setup and scan with your phone. Trusted devices can be watches, headphones, other Bluetooth gear, and NFC stickers you position. Trusted voice The Trusted voice option is associated with Google Assistant and its voice detection system. I don't think this works that well with the Samsung Galaxy S8, as I cannot ever get Google Assistant to launch on the S8 Plus unless the phone is plugged in and charging or the display is on. With the LG G6 I can just state OK Google any time to have it launch, but not with the S8. While one method may not perform as you desire, you can easily enable all four of these modes in Google Smart Lock. I enabled on-body detection, added my home as a trusted place, added my Samsung Gear S3 Frontier as a trusted device, and enabled the trusted voice option on Friday after reading Adrian's article. My weekend was spent in Galaxy S8 Plus unlock bliss as these methods worked and meant I had a seamless experience in picking up and using my phone. I simply picked up the phone and pressed on the virtual home screen button to start using the phone with no other steps required. The frustration that I experienced before was gone and I plan to keep using Google Smart Lock. If you want to use the fingerprint sensor to unlock your phone every time, then I recommend using a case that will help you target the proper area next to the camera. I've been using Caseology, Speck, Tech21, and VRS Design cases and find they do help me hit the fingerprint sensor much better than when the S8 Plus is naked.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman New for OSCON 2017: Tensorflow Day and Infrastructure Boot Camp SEBASTOPOL, CA–(Marketwired – April 24, 2017) – O’Reilly Media announces the addition of TensorFlow Day and Infrastructure Boot Camp to OSCON, the O’Reilly Open Source Convention, May 8-11, 2017, at the Austin Convention Center. „Open source continues to be a catalyst for innovation. Machine learning and containers are two of the most exciting current examples, and we’ve added two special new events, TensorFlow Day and Infrastructure Boot Camp, that give OSCON attendees a great way to get right to work using these important new technologies,” says Rachel Roumeliotis, who chairs OSCON along with Microsoft’s Scott Hanselman and Google’s Kelsey Hightower. Designed and presented by Google’s Amy Unruh and Yufeng Gu, TensorFlow Day is an intense introduction to Google’s powerful, flexible, and popular open source library for machine learning. Kicking off with a keynote on the state and future of TensorFlow, the day includes lots of demos that show the incredible range and impact of machine and deep learning, powered by TensorFlow. Infrastructure Boot Camp is a four-day immersion in the key technologies of modern, cloud-based infrastructure containers, Docker, and Kubernetes. Software developers and devops engineers will learn how to deliver efficiency and innovation with continuous integration via the cloud from expert practitioners from Google, Cloudera, Netflix, Docker, and other leading companies. With over 25 workshops and hundreds of sessions across four days, OSCON is the one place that engineers and technology decision-makers can discover the latest tools and technologies, get in-depth training in crucial languages, frameworks, and best practices, and survey the entire range of open source applications. Registration remains open, and a limited number of media passes are available for qualified journalists and analysts. For more information or to request an interview, contact maureen@oreilly.com.

Meyers April 24th, 2017 Half of Page-1 Google Results Are Now&nbspHTTPS Search Engines | Technical SEO 15 16 Just over 9 months ago, I wrote that 30% of page-1 Google results in our 10,000-keyword tracking set were secure (HTTPS). As of earlier this week, that number topped 50%: While there haven't been any big jumps recently – suggesting this change is due to steady adoption of HTTPS and not a major algorithm update – the end result of a year of small changes is dramatic. More and more Google results are secure. MozCast is, of course, just one data set, so I asked the folks at Rank Ranger, who operate a similar (but entirely different) tracking system, if they thought I was crazy... Could we both be crazy? Absolutely. However, we operate completely independent systems with no shared data, so I think the consistency in these numbers suggests that we're not wildly off. What about the future? Projecting the fairly stable trend line forward, the data suggests that HTTPS could hit about 65% of page-1 results by the end of 2017. The trend line is, of course, an educated guess at best, and many events could change the adoption rate of HTTPS pages. I've speculated previously that, as the adoption rate increased, Google would have more freedom to bump up the algorithmic (i.e. ranking) boost for HTTPS pages. I asked Gary Illyes if such a plan was in the works, and he said "no": As with any Google statement, some of you will take this as gospel truth and some will take it as devilish lies. While he isn't promising that Google will never boost the ranking benefits of HTTPS, I believe Gary on this one. I think Google is happy with the current adoption rate and wary of the collateral damage that an aggressive HTTPS ranking boost (or penalty) could cause. It makes sense that they would bide their time.. Who hasn't converted? One of the reasons Google may be proceeding with caution on another HTTPS boost (or penalty) is that not all of the big players have made the switch. Here are the Top 20 subdomains in the MozCast dataset, along with the percentage of ranking URLs that use HTTPS: (1) en.wikipedia.org — 100.0% (2) www. amazon.com — 99.9% (3) www. facebook.com — 100.0% (4) www. yelp.com — 99.7% (5) www. youtube.com — 99.6% (6) www. pinterest.com — 100.0% (7) www. walmart.com — 100.0% (8) www. tripadvisor.com — 99.7% (9) www. webmd.com — 0.2% (10) allrecipes.com — 0.0% (11) www. target.com — 0.0% (12) www. foodnetwork.com — 0.0% (13) www. ebay.com — 0.0% (14) play.google.com — 100.0% (15) www. bestbuy.com — 0.0% (16) www. mayoclinic.org — 0.0% (17) www. homedepot.com — 0.0% (18) www. indeed.com — 0.0% (19) www. zillow.com — 100.0% (20) shop.nordstrom.com – 0.0% Of the Top 20, exactly half have switched to HTTPS, although most of the Top 10 have converted. Not surprisingly, switching is, with only minor exceptions, nearly all-or-none. Most sites naturally opt for a site-wide switch, at least after initial testing. What should you do? Even if Google doesn't turn up the reward or penalty for HTTPS, other changes are in play, such as Chrome warning visitors about non-secure pages when those pages collect sensitive data. As the adoption rate increases, you can expect pressure to switch to increase. For new sites, I'd recommend jumping in as soon as possible. Security certificates are inexpensive these days (some are free), and the risks are low. For existing sites, it's a lot tougher. Any site-wide change carries risks, and there have certainly been a few horror stories this past year. At minimum, make sure to secure pages that collect sensitive information or process transactions, and keep your eyes open for more changes.

It would be interesting to know what is the percentage of websites (out of these 50%) recently moved to https (after Google announced it as a ranking signal). Also, which industry is adopting this change more rapidly? I suspect it might be eCommerce and News verticals, but not sure. Thanks 3 0 Reply <p>Interesting stats, Dr. Pete!</p>

We saw a big bump up over a year ago when Wikipedia went HTTPS, because they have such a huge footprint. There's been a very steady progression of sites switching, though. That trend line has looked roughly the same for well over two years. 2 0 Reply <p>The migration has been pretty gradual.

Comparing to the domain migration that was quite a nightmare from a rankings perspective 4.5 years ago, this switch was smooth and quick. We've been thinking about migrating to HTTPS for the past couple of years, but it was only this article on TechCrunch about a Chrome notification for HTTP domains that actually made us go ahead and do it. Of course, there's some work involved, and there are quite many things to make sure that are in place. But it's very doable, and I don't see a reason to stay with HTTP in 2017. Even if only from a branding point of view. 2 0 Reply <p>We switched all of Investing.com's 30 subdomains to HTTPS exactly 3 months ago.</p>

I also didn't realise that it was growing this rapidly. Because online security hacks are becoming more intelligent these days it's definitely important to provide customers with this extra security to give an overall peace of mind. I think because the security certificates are inexpensive/ free we will eventually see all if not most websites opting for a HTTPS site, after all it does make sense. 1 0 Reply <p>This is a very interesting article. </p>

According to Google Trends, Monday, Ahn's overall index is at 47, lower than the Democratic Party of Korea candidate Moon Jae-in's 77. The election is slated for May 9. Google Trends is a real-time dataset launched in 2006 that shows the search frequency of certain keywords, with 100 as the maximum Google index and zero as the lowest. It does not show which candidate is doing better in the presidential race, but provides a glimpse of what is on voters' minds. Ahn was a laggard in the presidential race until March, but the software mogul-turned-politician surged past Moon in terms of search frequency following his nomination, April 4. However, since Ahn last outnumbered Moon, April 18 — 87 to 68 — voters have searched the latter more frequently than the former, with the gap becoming 100 against 66 as of April 19. The drop in his search frequency may pose an additional blow to Ahn whose support rating is falling as the search trends are largely in line with public surveys. According to the latest five public polls in the past three days, Moon's lead over Ahn ranged from 9 percentage points to 12 percentage points — a sharp contrast to the early-April polls showing that Ahn was neck and neck with Moon. In the latest poll conducted by the conservative daily Chosun Ilbo and research firm Kantata Public between April 21 and 22, Moon garnered 37.5 percent, and Ahn 26.4 percent. This compares with an April 7 and 8 survey in which Moon gained 35.7 percent and Ahn 37.5 percent. Currently, Ahn faces questions about the 2011 employment of his wife as a professor at Seoul National University, with some claiming that she received favors thanks to Ahn's status. In addition, Ahn failed to impress voters through the first three TV debates on April 13, 19 and 24 among the top five presidential candidates that also included the Liberty Party Korea's Hong Joon-pyo, Bareun Party's Yoo Seong-min and Sim Sang-jung of the Justice Party. Google Trends made its name after predicting Brexit, or Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, and the election of President Donald Trump last year. Back then, the consensus was that the U.K. would vote against Brexit while a majority of experts and media outlets predicted Trump's defeat against Hilary Clinton. However, some critics point out that Google Trends is not a perfect tool to replace public polls because search trends data that are irrespective of pros and cons may not have a strong correlation with each candidate's support rating. Another hitch in Korea is that Google is not a dominant player here. It is a distant No. 3 search engine following the dominant Naver and runner-up Daum, which prompts suspicions that Google Trends data may not be sufficient to offer relevant search trends. ksw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Candidates disappoint voters in TV debates Which candidate is winning on social media?

Published on April 24, 2017. Marc Speichert, chief digital officer of GSK Consumer Healthcare Credit: GSK Most Popular Marc Speichert has looked at digital marketing from both sides now -- or maybe three. The former chief marketing officer at beauty giant L'Oreal turned heads three years ago by moving to Google to consult with brands across industries. Now he's back in packaged goods in a new role as chief digital officer of GSK Consumer Healthcare, marketer of such brands as Sensodyne, Theraflu, Flonase, Alli and Boost. That comes after a stint last year in a similar role at Swiss luxury manufacturer/retailer Richemont. Being an alum isn't making him soft on Google: GSK is among companies that recently paused advertising there over brand-safety issues. It illustrates how the marketer role he returns to is different than what left. Spending is up, and with that comes increased expectations. Speichert's remit includes digital marketing, media, insights (market research) and e-commerce. GlaxoSmithKline has a relatively new leadership team from CEO Emma Walmsley on down. Consumer Healthcare has no global CMO, but Speichert reports to Carlton Lawson, global head of categories, and will be based in London. Here he talks about how digital marketing has changed and what he learned at Google. Ad Age: Why did you come to GSK? Speichert: GSK was one of my clients at Google. So it's good when you get an inside view of what the client is all about. This gives me a chance to go back to the client side and drive some major transformation, and I could see myself fitting in from a cultural perspective. Ad Age: Why did you leave Richemont? Speichert: It was a great brand builder on one side and retailer on the other. I learned a lot. In the end, I was looking at where I could drive the biggest impact and innovation.

Speichert: Being at Google enabled me to look under the hood and understand how things work. I worked with many different clients – CPG, beverage and tech clients. But what was interesting was that even though the industries were very different, they had similar hot topics. Everyone was talking about data and insights into data. Do I have scale? Can I build competitive advantage by leveraging my first-party data? The other interesting area was content. It's even more fragmented and the need for it greater than ever. How do you build the right ecosystem of suppliers? A lot of people are developing their own direct-to-consumer sites and trying to do it themselves. But the other question is how do you become a better partner with the retailers and what does that mean about your media dollars and how do you do activation. And the other was looking at things in a much more granular way from a media side – how do you do precision buying? Ad Age: Do brand marketers need to get under the hood to better understand the technology they work with? Speichert: I think everybody in the organization should understand the fundamentals. Going back to my Google days, we had a lot of discussions with my clients around what marketing in a digital world and data-driven marketing should be about and how Google can help. In certain instances, you realize that some folks are jumping into things without having the fundamentals in place. Things like properly tagging your site so you can get learning from first-party data. These are foundational things that people aren't really doing. Here I'm really trying to push forward how an idea or technology can help them from a business perspective, and demystify and take it to a broader business conversation. We spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to build the right pipe from a programmatic side. And, yes, we need to build the right pipe, but it's also important to be as smart about what you put into the pipe and how you build an ecosystem to get you the right assets. Ad Age: There's been a lot of industry pushback lately on your old employer Google, both on audience measurement and brand safety. What's your take on that? Speichert: We are very stringent about brand-safety expectations. And we've taken some measures, some close, direct conversations in terms of what's required moving forward. Ad Age: Did you pause advertising with Google? Speichert: We did pause some of our advertising, and we are talking with Google about what are some of the tools that will give us full confidence in going back. We're waiting to get the measure of the tools they have in place before we go back. Ad Age: Is it harder to do digital now with all the measurement and brand-safety worries? Speichert: Absolutely yes in regard to brand safety. Given the criticality of brand-safe environments, it's requiring a great deal of resources. This is time that would be better spent developing and executing digital programs to grow our brands. As it relates to viewability and whitelist strategies, most major advertisers like GSK already have plans in place to ensure these KPIs are effectively met, so that is not adding additional complexity. Ad Age: How do you handle programmatic buying? In house? Through an agency? A combination? Speichert: We're really leveraging our agencies now – both PHD (Omnicom) and WPP -- to operate our programmatic campaign, and we're developing some internal capabilities as well to ensure it's a real partnership. Ad Age: What should be the role of the big players in digital media – Google and Facebook? Where do you look to them for help? Speichert: The focus on a shorter list of publishers is a good thing, because it lets you go deeper and drive the partnership in a more robust way. When you look at what I sometimes call the shiny-object syndrome, it's very tempting for marketers to experiment with the new players. I'm a big believer in nailing the basics. We've done a lot of great things already from a search perspective. Something with a company like Google is critical in that context. It's very important to have that short list of publishers we have a privileged relationship with, and then of course we want to have a handful of folks we do experimentation with, test and learn, and make sure that's properly orchestrated. We did some really cool stuff with IBM Watson in the U.S. before I arrived. That was a great example of AI-powered ads that very smartly helped you. It was a very smart move and we were one of the first companies to do that in the U.S. And we're now scaling to do that much farther and deeper. Ad Age: Do you still need both digital and general creative agencies? Speichert: As we simplified our agencies recently, we felt it was important to [have both]. It really depends on the level of maturity of the brand. As long as you have a powerful way to connect the agencies and have them work together, I think it's less about having a one-stop shop but having a complete collection. Speichert is focused on relationships with biggest players, but cites this program using IBM Watson as example of experimentation with others.

TECHNOLOGY Why the AI Brain Drain Won't Last The artificial intelligence brain drain is becoming a real problem. By Scott Maxwell Scott Maxwell has worked in venture capital since 2000. In 2006, he founded OpenView Venture Partners, focusing on expansion-stage tech companies. He graduated from MIT with a Ph.D. in engineering and an M.S. in management. @scottsnews Founder, OpenView Venture Partners@scottsnews WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement As AI becomes the biggest disruptor in tech, the top firms are trying to corner the market on talent. In the last year or so, Google has assembled one of the industry's biggest teams of AI experts, including Fei-Fei Li, the head of Stanford's AI Lab. Uber also poached a team of 40 researchers from Carnegie Mellon University. Competition for talent among those companies plus Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Baidu is so intense that some recruits start out with seven-figure salaries. To some, it looks like top-tier firms have hoarded all the talent. Google has admitted that it now houses "less than 50% but certainly more than 5%" of the world's leading experts in machine learning. If a handful of tech companies monopolize all the talent, the thinking goes, then they will control the future of AI and tech. While this is a legitimate cause for concern - especially since the firms are raiding teachers from academia - the effect isn't likely to last. High salaries, global competition, open-sourced algorithms/platforms, and the lure of starting one's own company or joining an elite start-up will ensure that AI innovation will be democratized, even if it takes a few years. The lure of a hot new career AI talent is in such demand now that Microsoft research chief Peter Lee has likened the cost of acquiring an AI researcher to nabbing an NFL quarterback. As word of such salaries filter down, more undergraduates will inevitably consider AI as a career. Interestingly, a 2016 survey of the "hardest jobs to fill in tech," AI didn't make the list. I suspect it will in 2017 or 2018 based on what I see happening in tech. That ranking reflects the fact that so far, it's just the leading edge companies and schools schools that are throwing resources at AI. That will inevitably change as more firms realize that AI is essential to innovation and more students and software developers see the opportunities in AI. Seven-figure salaries may also convince tech workers in other fields to learn AI as well. Such workers have resources like Andrew Ng's course on Coursera and Kaggle, which teaches machine learning coding. The lure of entrepreneurship Another argument against a generational AI brain drain is the entrepreneurial drive. If someone who knows AI well can command a seven-figure salary, then she can probably also get funding for her startup or may prefer to join an elite team in a start-up working on an important problem. While the possibility of becoming a billionaire is a strong draw for going this route, there are other motivations. Some want to change the world. Others want to work on difficult problems with small, elite teams. Still others want to do things their way. As Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard has stated, "If you want to understand the entrepreneur, study the juvenile delinquent. The delinquent is saying with his actions, 'This sucks. I'm going to do my own thing.'" People with that mentality don't do well in a corporate environment. For proof of this, look at Andrew Ng. A Google veteran, Ng recently left Baidu to pursue his own path. Though it's not clear where he's going, Ng's Medium post on the topic referred to "rich opportunities in entrepreneurship." The global marketplace While universities in the U.S. and Canada can rightly charge that Google and others have raided their staffs, let's not forget that we're living in a global economy. In 2020, the U.S. and the European Union will only account for 25% of the world's college-educated people. China, meanwhile, opens a new university every week. In 2013, 40% of Chinese graduates completed STEM educations. That's double the U.S. rate. By 2030, China and India could account for 60% of STEM graduates in major economies versus 4% for the U.S. Those are sobering figures. At the moment, the U.S. is still winning the competition for AI talent, but Chinese firms - especially Baidu - are aggressively pursuing AI talent. China's universities also began focusing a few years ago on AI so the fruits of that effort won't be seen for a few years. The end of the brain drain In addition to those factors, some tech companies have started making moves to ensure that there's more AI talent in the pipeline. As one AI professor told MIT Technology Review in 2014, tech companies have stepped up their grants since they realized they'll soon run out of recruits. Elon Musk and other top tech leaders pledged to spend over $1 billion for OpenAI, a not-for-profit initiative that will share its work with the public. Initiatives like this could lead to open platforms that make it quite easy for even less advanced software developers to incorporate AI algorithms into their software products. These are positive signs, showing the market won't allow a vacuum much longer. Assessing the scene from a global level, Google, Apple, Uber and others look like they're trying to plug leaks in a dam with their fingers. They can't hold off the torrent though.

Secure Axcess, LLC v. PNC Bank National Association, Case No. 16-1353 (Fed. Cir., Feb. 21, 2017) (Plager, J) (Lourie, J, dissenting); Twilio Inc. v. Telesign Corporation, Case No. CBM2016-00099 (PTAB, Feb. 27, 2017) (Arbes, APJ); Google Inc. v. Klaustech, Inc., Case No. CBM2016-00096 (PTAB, Feb, 27, 2017) (Zecher, APJ). These decisions come on the heels of the Federal Circuit's Unwired Planet decision, where the Court found Unwired Planet's patent to be ineligible for CBM review because the PTAB improperly used an overly broad definition of a CBM patent ( IP Update, Vol. 19, No. 12). In Secure Axcess, the patent at issue relates to computer security with a focus on authenticating a web page. The PTAB instituted CBM review of Secure Axcess's patent, explaining that "because the patent is directed to solving problems related to providing a web site to customers of financial institutions . . . , the patent covers the ancillary activity related to a financial product or service." The PTAB also reasoned that the patent disclosed a need by financial institutions to ensure that customers are confident that a financial institution's web page is authentic. In its final written decision, the PTAB maintained that Secure Axcess's patent was subject to CBM review. Secure Axcess appealed. On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the PTAB, concluding that "the statutory definition of a CBM patent requires that the patent have a claim that contains . . . a financial activity element." The Court explained that Congress intended the CBM program to be more limited in scope, and that a broad reading of the statute would allow any patent to qualify for CBM review if it claimed a method or corresponding apparatus for performing any operations that happen to be used in "the practice, administration, or management of a financial product or service." According to the Court, to find otherwise would give the CBM program "a virtually unconstrained reach." In this case, as part of its broader discussion of what is a "financial product or service," the PTAB concluded that "[t]he method and apparatus claimed by the [] patent perform operations used in the practice, administration, or management of a financial product or service and are incidental to a financial activity" (emphasis in original). Citing Unwired Planet, the Court explained that the phrase "incidental to a financial activity" is not part of the statutory definition of a CBM patent. Thus, by expanding the definition, the PTAB reached beyond the question of whether the claims, as understood in light of the written description, met the statutory definition. For these reasons, the Court vacated the PTAB's ruling and remanded the case back to the PTAB. In dissent, Judge Lourie argued that that the claims of the patent are directed to "a method or corresponding apparatus for performing data processing or other operations used in the practice, administration, or management of a financial product or service" (emphasis in original). He also argued that the patent met the statutory definition for a "financial product or service" because of the discussion in the specification regarding specific applications in the management of a financial service. Judge Lourie acknowledged that the term "financial" does not appear in the patent claims, but argued that should not decide the outcome because, as a matter of patent law, claims are not required to recite uses of products. In Telesign, the PTAB denied institution of a CBM review of a patent directed to the verification of user identity during an online registration process. The PTAB determined that the claims of the challenged patent failed to meet this definition. Citing the Federal Circuit decision in Unwired Planet, the PTAB explained that the challenged patent must have at least one claim that contains "a financial activity element" to be eligible for CBM review. In this case, the PTAB found the words "service" and "notification event," as used in the claims, to be "generic, context-neutral terms, without any express or implicit connection to financial products or services." Even though the PTAB agreed with the petitioner that the specification describes embodiments pertaining to finance-related services, the specification does not indicate that such embodiments are limited to finance-related activities. Rather, the specification describes the embodiments in contexts beyond those that are financial in nature.� In Klaustech, Google filed a petition challenging claims of Klaustech's patent directed to internet advertising with centralized control of ad content being presented at a browser. Before the patent owner's preliminary response, the PTAB afforded the petitioner an opportunity to file a paper in view of the Federal Circuit's decision in Unwired Planet. After considering the issues, the PTAB declined to institute CBM review, finding that the patent did not include any claim that satisfied the financial prong of the CBM patent eligibility test. The PTAB also considered Secure Axcess, but found that that case did not alter the final outcome or analysis, concluding it was consistent with Unwired Planet.� The PTAB explained that the CBM patent eligibility test is focused on the claim language and requires determining whether the claims recite explicit or inherent terminology or limitations that are financial in nature. The PTAB was not persuaded by petitioner's argument that the claims, when read in light of the specification, are directed to a CBM, explaining that the examples in the specification were permissive and did not limit the scope of the claims to being financial in nature. Although the PTAB acknowledged that internet advertising involves the sale of ad space, it concluded that the fact that a sale has occurred or may occur is not sufficient to transform a patent into a CBM-eligible patent when the challenged claims neither recite a sale nor are otherwise directed to the practice, administration or management of a financial product or service. Practice Note: Going forward, petitioners seeking CBM review should be careful to make a showing that the challenged patent claims specifically relate to finance, since, in the wake of Unwired Planet, the PTAB is giving significant scrutiny to the "financial product or service" aspect of the CBM definition.� Petitions Seeking CBM Review Continue Uphill Battle After Unwired Planet The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

"Open source continues to be a catalyst for innovation. Machine learning and containers are two of the most exciting current examples, and we've added two special new events, TensorFlow Day and Infrastructure Boot Camp, that give OSCON attendees a great way to get right to work using these important new technologies," says Rachel Roumeliotis, who chairs OSCON along with Microsoft's Scott Hanselman and Google's Kelsey Hightower. Designed and presented by Google's Amy Unruh and Yufeng Gu, TensorFlow Day is an intense introduction to Google's powerful, flexible, and popular open source library for machine learning. Kicking off with a keynote on the state and future of TensorFlow, the day includes lots of demos that show the incredible range and impact of machine and deep learning, powered by TensorFlow. Infrastructure Boot Camp is a four-day immersion in the key technologies of modern, cloud-based infrastructure containers, Docker, and Kubernetes. Software developers and devops engineers will learn how to deliver efficiency and innovation with continuous integration via the cloud from expert practitioners from Google, Cloudera, Netflix, Docker, and other leading companies. With over 25 workshops and hundreds of sessions across four days, OSCON is the one place that engineers and technology decision-makers can discover the latest tools and technologies, get in-depth training in crucial languages, frameworks, and best practices, and survey the entire range of open source applications. Registration remains open, and a limited number of media passes are available for qualified journalists and analysts. For more information or to request an interview, contact maureen@oreilly.com.

Follow @Bershidsky April 24, 2017 6:12 AM EDT a | A By Leonid Bershidsky I met Las Vegas lawyer Robert Barnes during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Long before everyone else I know, he was betting -- literally, through U.K. bookmakers -- on Brexit and Donald Trump's victory. He made hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself and the clients he advised from these bets. In Sunday's French election, however, he says he merely broke even. Barnes told me he'd bet on progressive centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-left Jean-Luc Melenchon to make the run-off round. At 20-1, he believed the risk-reward ratio was worth it. And lots of non-polling data were increasingly pointing toward Melenchon, just like they had been toward Brexit and Trump: Facebook, Twitter and YouTube engagement, mentions on the media, Google searches. Then, on Sunday morning, after watching Google search trends, Barnes added a separate bet on Macron to win the first round. That's how he narrowly avoided a loss. Betting on "black swans" and protest votes can be profitable. But it appears that only the U.K. and the U.S., two countries where elites have long talked condescendingly of continental Europe, have produced unsettling political surprises in the current election cycle. I'm being polite; others would say they made stupid, perhaps disastrous, choices. Sickly old Europe, whose demise has been predicted over and over as the European Union endured years of recession, stagnation, high unemployment, mediocre leadership and pessimism, has consistently resisted the appeal of populist leaders -- both the nationalist kind represented in France by Marine Le Pen and Melenchon's radical leftist kind. Before France, the populists lost in Austria and the Netherlands. After France, they will almost certainly suffer a resounding defeat in Germany. The liberal European project doesn't just live to fight another day, as some pundits have grudgingly conceded; it continues to celebrate what outsiders deride as weakness. It's pointless to add up Sunday's fringe votes. Le Pen plus Melenchon isn't just a classic case of apples and oranges -- the people who voted for them probably couldn't spend 15 minutes in the same room without throttling each other. The pattern in recent and ongoing European elections is that in the run-up, voters show their disgruntlement by elevating noisy populists in polls, but then they cast ballots responsibly. The first round of a French election is a kind of glorified poll, a chance for people to make extravagant statements. In 2015, Le Pen's National Front did great in the first round of regional elections only to lose everything in the decisive round; the same is about to happen to Le Pen herself this year. She stands to win just a third of the vote to Macron's two thirds, a landslide by any standard. I say that with reasonable confidence because, unlike in the U.K. and the U.S., but like in the Netherlands, polls in France have turned out to be highly accurate. Going into the weekend, they put Macron two points ahead of Le Pen and Melenchon and conservative candidate Francois Fillon neck-to-neck about two points behind her. That is exactly how the race played out. Good Job, Pollsters! The French polls predicted the first round result with a frightening precision   Sources: BFM.TV, Financial Times, official early results There is, therefore, no reason to distrust poll predictions for the second round; barring an unexpected disaster, Macron is about to win comfortably. And a disaster is highly unlikely: If anyone could compromise Macron, they would have done it before the first round, when he was weaker and there were other options for middle-of-the-road voters. The accuracy of polls is just one way in which continental Europe has been more normal than the English-speaking countries. Both the Dutch and the French campaigns have been hard-fought and unusually dirty, but no one can claim foreign interference or hacking has affected the results. Macron claims there have been numerous attempts to hack his campaign, but if any have been successful, they turned up no damaging material. There was plenty of "fake news" to be found in France too, but it seemed to have played no role in determining the results.  That persistent normalcy reflects continental Europe's equally persistent divergence from the U.S. and the U.K. The continent has higher government expenditure and lower growth, but also less inequality, higher saving rates and lower household debt. People's lives are less precarious in the core EU than in the English-speaking countries. Voters in the major continental nations may get angry and disappointed -- say, with French President Francois Hollande's feckless leadership or with the recent inflow of refugees from the Middle East -- but they don't get desperate enough to vote in a Donald Trump or to inflict Brexit-style turmoil on their countries. Core EU countries may lose on certain economic parameters, but they win the sanity competition. That is a major, and underestimated, achievement of the EU: It has fostered a non-radical culture and a non-radical consensus that even powerful turbulence cannot destroy. What, however, if the populist wave has merely slowed down, and, frustrated with more of the same, Europeans will give the populists a chance to govern in the next election? That's highly unlikely. Centrist leaders will work to consolidate their power and weaken their rivals' arguments. It's likely to mean tougher border policies and more pressure on newcomers to integrate, and certainly more targeted job policies to increase voter security. The EU unemployment rates are already on the way down, and, for better or for worse, there's less of a threat of tech-driven job destruction than in the U.S. because the EU's embrace of the tech revolution has been more cautious. Leaders such as Macron, Mark Rutte in the Netherlands, and Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz in Germany are visibly learning from their interactions with the hard left and far right. If anything, they will be tougher to dislodge in four or five years. Barnes is smart to be betting on Macron in the second round as well, just as he was smart not to bet on Hillary Clinton. It's time to stop making disparaging comments about the EU and shorting the euro because of political fears. The biggest risks today are in the English-speaking world -- at least until it fully internalizes its populist inoculation.
