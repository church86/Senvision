The BlackBerry Priv is among a group of devices that achieved an update rate of 60 percent to 95 percent for its monthly security releases, including the Pixel devices; Nexus 5, 6, 5X and 6P; OnePlus and OnePlus 3; Samsung Galaxy S7; Asus Zenfone 3; LG V20 and Sony Xperia X Compact. “We are honored that PRIV was included in Google’s Android Security: 2016 Year in Review, and we take this as a signal that we’re living up to our promise to deliver the world’s most secure Android software platform,” stated BlackBerry senior vice-president and general manager of the mobility solutions division Alex Thurber in a blog post on Inside BlackBerry, adding: “It’s especially gratifying that the Priv was named among the market’s security leaders for the second year in a row.” BlackBerry was also named as one of four manufacturers (the others being LG, Samsung and OnePlus) that deliver Android security updates to flagship devices on the same day that Google updates its own smartphone — at least for unlocked devices bought directly from BlackBerry or its manufacturing partners. Thurber acknowledged that carriers sometimes hold updates “for various reasons.” Additionally, the report lauds BlackBerry for deploying a fix to a zero day vulnerability known as “Dirty Cow” — which was publicly disclosed on October 19th, 2016 — in time for the November 2016 security update. Google wrote in its report that in 2016, Android security updates addressed 655 vulnerabilities, 133 of which were critical in severity, 365 high, 154 moderate and three low — representing a more than 275% increase from 2015.

Lil’ Sooky Denton Shoggy ain’t allowed outta the basement till he clears those crusty tissues out from under the bed… Dimitri And yet many put Blackberry down yet even Google agreed that the Priv is the most secure device out there. I am proud that Google showed this. Maybe now some can actually believe it but hey, they all have their own opinions. Also when did Samsung and LG send out the updates? Lol the carriers barely release them as is. Dean Lubaki But it does not matter because Android, even with BlackBerry is still more insecure than iOS. We’re starting to use iPhone in the Ontario Public Service, and Android, even with BlackBerry, are nowhere to be found. Pretty sad! 2112 More insecure than iOS? gee I guess all the iOS hacks recently are false? the Cia openingly hacks iPhones all the time, theres a reason why top execs and governments use secure Blackberries, get your facts straight ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Well even Bla1ze pointed out there was an original version that did NOT include the Priv for some reason. And both DTEKs are still not on the list. Bill Patrick I love my DTEK60, but I’m still waiting for the Nougat update 🙁 🙁 >:( Ken Aisin I love my Priv. Also waiting for the Nougat update too. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Until BlackBerry stands behind their current phones and actually update them to Nougat, the KEYone’s “software” and “secure” promise rings hollow. TheCuddlyKoala They got your money, you’ll never see an update.. Ken Aisin That’s fine. I still love the phone though. TheCuddlyKoala They got your money, you’ll never see an update. Rev0lver Is there an echo in here? Lil’ Sooky Denton Congratulations on the 59 Tomahawks by the way. That’ll learn Ass-Ad good, reeeeeeeal gooood. canucks4life Most secure because no one bought it? Sorry couldn’t resist 🙂 2112 I have 2 Detek 60’s, 2 Detek 50’S AND 2 Priv’s … the Detek60 is the clear winner phone wise, But I agree PRIV is more secure. TheCuddlyKoala how do you talk on all of them? Are you an Octopus? J-Ro An octopus has ears? Magic18 Yes… 8 of them… Octa=8 Lil’ Sooky Denton Lol! And also in the news; ‘The CEO of Tata automobiles says Tata vehicles are the safest on the roads…’ TheCuddlyKoala Until Chen hands over your “privacy” to authorities….. 2112 Heck iPhones are just plain hackable period ask the CIA…or a 5 year old Lil’ Sooky Denton I’m 3 and a half an’ I never heard that. Lil’ Sooky Denton True dat ^^ ^^ (2 cats behind a wall…) JD If they remade this thing with the SD820, all the short comings fixed and <$700 CAN It would sell like hotcakes. tacoma I am user of Priv for 2 years now, previously Galaxy Note, Sony and Moto phones. Verdict: very very happy with Priv. High performance in all respects. Absolutely trust it. With today’s lower price, an amazing bargain for such a premium device. But what do I yearn for? Well, there is always something… I love to have a bigger, wider physical keyboard. Yes, BB, its the keyboard thing again. I want more … So happy BB remains in the mobile phone business. But what could a Priv Mark 2 be? Here’s a few suggestions: – Keep the format, the slider so that the OLED big screen stay – Wider and generally bigger physical keyboard. Love to see a numeric row, if this can be done. If screen size have to slightly smaller to get a bigger keyboard, so be it. – Dual front loudspeakers. – Removable battery. Allow extended off-grid or cold weather usage with multiple battery packs. This is an engineering challenge but the designers are up to it. – Shorten boot time. – Wireless charging for all models. Two USB ports (any type). But why? One for charging and one for data connection to USB devices that do not provide power, but drain considerable power instead. – General hardware update – Stainless steel construction. OK is this a joke and an wild crazy dream.

After taking a screenshot there’s an option to crop or draw in the share window, above the usual share options. The ‘Crop’ setting allows users to cut a portion of the screenshot, with a done or cancel option at the bottom. While ‘Draw’ lets users choose from six different colours to draw on the screenshot with, it also has an undo to the bottom left and a X for cancel and a check mark for done at the top. Although editing screenshots isn’t new and is possible with apps, this new integration would be a much quicker and more efficient method than before that’s easily accessible on all Android devices. This feature is currently only available in the beta version of the Google App, however this might be a feature coming to everyone in the future. Although we couldn’t replicate the feature in the MobileSyrup office, here is how you can become a beta tester, so you can give it a try for yourself.

Here’s how to get the most out of them Subscribe to our newsletter. Abhijit Ahaskar Maps not only provides price estimates and availability of cabs, but even allows users to book a cab and make payment form the Maps app itself. What makes Google Maps one of the most popular navigation apps is the sheer amount of options it offers. Google has no desire to rest on the laurels and has been regularly adding new features to its Android and iOS apps to make it more relevant and user-friendly. We take a look at some of the latest features that have been added to Maps and how they can help users get the most out of them. As of now, Route options you can add are avoid motorways, avoid toll roads and avoid ferries. Remember route preferences Google Maps by default shows the fastest possible route based on the traffic status on all the possible routes. So, if a route is longer and has several tolls but less traffic, Maps will show only that route. Now Maps allows users a bigger say in the roads they want to take and will remember it for future route suggestions. As of now, Route options you can add are avoid motorways, avoid toll roads and avoid ferries. To access it, open Maps->enter destination, start navigation and tap on the three dots icon at the top of the page and select Route options. Anyone can share their real-time location with their Google contacts for a fixed duration or until the user turns it off manually. Share your location Google Maps not only shows your own location and routes but can also show the route of a family member or friend travelling late at night. Anyone can share their real-time location with their Google contacts for a fixed duration or until the user turns it off manually. To activate it, go to Menu->Share location and follow the instructions. The feature works within Maps and doesn’t ask users to download another app. You can book a cab and see all the options in Maps just like in an Uber or Ola ap. Book a cab from Maps Maps not only provides price estimates and availability of cabs, but even allows users to book a cab and make payment form the Maps app itself. This means you can book a cab and see all the options in Maps just like in an Uber or Ola app. Payment can be made through Paytm, cash or credit cards. The good part is that you don’t need any of these apps to be on your phone to book a cab. However, you will need to link your Ola and Uber accounts with Maps, so it can open the API of these apps within its own interface.

Photo by David Drexel via Wikimedia Commons (CC BY 2.0) Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world. Elections have become a time when Internet censorship, online harassment, and the deliberate spread of misinformation escalate. Last year, social media networks were blocked in Uganda and Montenegro during national elections. In the Gambia and Gabon, the Internet was shut down altogether. Harassment of political candidates and activists alike was a hallmark of special parliamentary elections in Macedonia, presidential elections in the US, and last week’s chief executive elections in Hong Kong. As elections approach in Iran, hardliners are pressuring the Rouhani administration to block the Telegram messaging app. And the tide of harassment is rising in both Russia and France, as both nations prepare to choose their next leader. Elections in Armenia and Ecuador last week proved to be no exception. The lead-up to general elections in Armenia was marred by apparent attempts to thwart the online activities of journalists and at least one incident of fake news. A prominent civil society figure reported attempts by government-backed hackers to access his email account, and several Armenian journalists said their accounts on Twitter were suspended just before the vote. Their accounts have since been restored. Election monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe (OSCE) said the elections, which resulted in the victory of the current ruling Republican Party of Armenia, were generally well-administered, but still tainted by credible accusations of vote-buying and undue influence on civil servants and employees of private companies. Meanwhile in Ecuador, opposition party candidates and supporters faced a wave of social media account suspensions, as did media rights NGOs. Pro-opposition websites and a handful of NGOs publishing voter education information noticed a sharp decline in web traffic on local ISPs on the evening of the election, leading to suspicions of interference. The website for the Internet access group Usuarios Digitales also experienced a DDoS attack a few days before the election, as did the website of opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso. LiveJournal seals deal with Russia, bans ‘political solicitation’ After the blogging platform LiveJournal — which was acquired by the Russian company SUP Media in 2007 — moved its data servers from California to Russia. This means that the website’s data will now be fully accessible to Russian police, in accordance with Russia’s recently enacted “anti-terrorist” legislation. Along with other restrictions, an updated LiveJournal user agreement prohibits “political solicitation”, but does not define the meaning of the term. Will Google go back to school in China? Google Scholar may be the first Google service to return to China, according to a statement by senior Chinese lawmaker Liu Binjie. “China has been in touch with Google through various channels,” Binjie said, signaling hope that a part of Google’s business (which Binjie described as “service functions that do not involve [politically] sensitive information”) would return to China first, and be gradually followed by others. Google pulled its services from the Chinese market in 2010 due to a conflict over China’s strict censorship rules, but has expressed interest in returning to the market. Binjie’s remarks did not make clear whether censorship would be implemented in any of Google’s services. Bangladesh regulator rejects Facebook bedtime ban The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission rejected a proposal to block Facebook between the hours of midnight to 6:00am, a measure proposed by lawmakers who argued that Facebook was “dimming the working capabilities of the youths” and should therefore be inaccessible during bedtime hours. The BTRC instead has suggested that parental controls and privacy and security features would be a better method to achieve this objective. The BTRC’s recommendation now leaves the final decision up to the government. UAE intellectuals and activists face threats in court, and online Prominent academic Dr. Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced by a UAE court to 10 years in prison for “posting false information” on Twitter about UAE leaders “in order to harm the reputation and stature of the State.” According to Amnesty International, bin Ghaith made comments on Twitter that he had not been given a fair trial in an earlier case in which he and four others were prosecuted for “publicly insulting” the country’s leaders in online comments, in what is known as the “UAE Five” case. He may appeal the sentence within 30 days. Dr. bin Ghaith’s case follows that of Ahmed Mansoor, another member of the UAE Five, who was arrested the week prior. Supporters of Mansoor who tweeted about his arrest were attacked for defending a “traitor that deserves to die”. Global Voices volunteers analyzed the interactions between supporters of Mansoor and those who attacked them and found that some of the most influential tweets critical of Mansoor came from accounts that appear to belong to government employees or affiliates, who led hardline government supporters in online attacks against Mansoor. Spy stingrays spotted in Canada An investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation found that IMSI catchers, devices that spy on cellphones within a geographic area, are being used in the area around Ottawa’s Parliament Hill. Also known as Stingrays, IMSI catchers work by mimicking a cellphone tower and scooping up the data available within an area, typically of all devices within a radius of half a kilometer. Though CBC journalists confirmed that the IMSI catchers were being persistently used around Parliament, they were not able to determine who was using them. Indian developers take on “fake news” on WhatsApp, Facebook Two Indian technologists, Bal Krishn Birla and Shammas Oliyath, are working to build a website, check4spam.com, which will help to detect fake messages spread using WhatsApp and Facebook. The initiative aims to curb the spread of false and malicious information and to “make life easy for the common man and life trouble for spammers.” New Research Big Data: un aporte para la discusion de la politica publica en Colombia – Fundacion Karisma     Subscribe to the Netizen Report by email     Afef Abrougui, Ellery Roberts Biddle, Rezwan Islam, Kevin Rothrock, Nevin Thompson, Laura Vidal and Sarah Myers West contributed to this report.

At a court hearing Friday (April 7),  a Labor Department official said the agency found “systemic compensation disparities against women” at Google. The government sued Google in January, demanding statistics on employee compensation. Federal contractors are required to comply with federal civil rights law. The government says Google was selected randomly for an audit and refused to hand over data despite repeated requests. “They run the risk of losing all their federal contracts — that’s a significant punishment,” says attorney Randolph McLaughlin, who teaches labor law at Pace Law School. “To be accused in this day in age of paying hundreds of thousands of women across the board at a lower rate, that significantly has the potential to damage the brand. In a statement, Google says it vehemently disagrees with the government. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” said Google’s statement. “Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the Department of Labor hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” Google pointed us to a tweet it sent out on equal pay day, an op-ed and its pay equity guide. It did not provide us with any data nor would it tell us whether it has supplied the Department of Labor with the hard data it has asked for.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

(AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2017, file photo, YouTube CEO Susan Wojicki speaks during the introduction of YouTube TV at YouTube Space LA in Los Angeles. Google’s online package of about 40 television channels debuts on Wednesday, April 5, 2017, in the tech industry’s latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for television. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) New York • YouTube TV, Google's new streaming package of about 40 television channels, is the tech industry's latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for live TV over the internet. It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don't confuse the YouTube service, which debuts Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T's DirecTV, YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. VIDEOS TOP JOBS But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven't been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet; getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century . ——— WHAT YOU GET ... AND WHAT YOU DON'T YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS — but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won't get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you'll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of "The Walking Dead." Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area — all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. ——— SEARCH PARTY As you'd expect from Google, search is one of YouTube's big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as "aliens" or "road trips." Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress. A search for "nerd comedy" brings up "The Big Bang Theory," but "comedy about nerds" does not. And a search for "Modern Family episode on basketball" doesn't bring up the episode titled "Basketball." YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually — too much work for a service that promises simplicity. » Next page...

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 102 Plus 1 on G+ 151 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares310 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) 66 Follow Share Tweet Technology giant Google is being sued by the Department of Labor over accusations that the company systematically underpays women for the same work as men. Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, made the claims during a court hearing in San Francisco on Friday, according to the Guardian. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” she said. Further, Labor department regional solicitor, Janet Herold added, according to the Guardian: The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters. The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry. Google vehemently denied any wrongdoing in a statement. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” they said. But for years, there has been a problem with Silicon Valley’s hiring practices, considering that a large portion of tech company employees are white and Asian men. According to the Associated Press, just one-third of Google’s employees are women. Even then, just 19 percent of the overall workforce consists of women in technology roles. More from the AP: The Labor Department’s probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers’ privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs. The allegations come just days after national “Equal Pay Day,” a day where companies and activists nationwide gathered to fight the alleged pay gay between men and women. Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today → https://t.co/KTuGTJMV16 pic.twitter.com/rBciSK21uF — Google (@Google) April 4, 2017 In addition, the company added on its famous homepage under the Google search bar: “Google supports equal pay.” That, however, might be false if the government’s allegations prove correct.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Verizon-Verizon+ Android-Android+ Software updates-Software updates+ Google-Google+ Google released Android 7.1.2 Nougat factory images and OTA files for the Nexus and Pixel devices, but the update won't be available for other Android OEMs for a while. Moreover, Google included the April security patch in the update, thus being the first to provide it to its customers. Verizon's Pixel smartphones received the update as well, but the US carrier is rolling out another one that brings a couple if improvements on top of those released by Google. The update is available for both Pixel and Pixel XL at Verizon, but it won't change the Android version, your phone will remain at Android 7.1.2 Nougat. However, Verizon's update has the build number NHG47K, whereas Google released build numbers N2G47J and N2G47E for Pixel and Pixel XL, respectively. So, aside from better performance and connectivity for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, Verizon's update adds a new feature that allows Pixel users to back up and restore 1st-party apps like Calendar, Drive, and Messenger. Also, both Pixel and Pixel XL should perform better during voice calls. Verizon mentions that the update is supposed to fix certain HD Voice and Wi-Fi calling options that were missing after the phone's software was updated. Last but not least, a bug that prevented the phone from receiving text messages in rare cases has been addressed too. Make sure that your battery is fully charged before starting the software update though.

VZWuser76 (Posts: 4650; Member since: 04 Mar 2010) Where do you guys see in the article that is says US networks have an upper hand? The only thing I see that's close to what you're talking about is that in addition to what Google has released to it's Pixel phones, Verizon added a few other features. To me it's no different than how they used to do it, where the update would come with carrier tweaks (usually bloatware) but in this case it actually appears like the tweaks are beneficial to the users instead of the carriers. But so far each of the build numbers for Verizon Pixels have been different than the build numbers for phones bought through the Google Store. posted on yesterday, 15:45 0 Reply 7. tuminatr (Posts: 812; Member since: 23 Feb 2009) https://community.verizonwireless.com/thread/923796 posted on yesterday, 15:52 0 in response to #6 in response to #6 Hide Reply 8. nebula (Posts: 769; Member since: 20 Feb 2015) Because kahuna here is Verizon. posted on yesterday, 15:19 0 Reply 3.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies.

It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don't confuse the YouTube service, which debuts Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T's DirecTV , YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven't been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet; getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century . ___ WHAT YOU GET ... AND WHAT YOU DON'T YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS — but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won't get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you'll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of "The Walking Dead." Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area — all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. ___ SEARCH PARTY As you'd expect from Google, search is one of YouTube's big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as "aliens" or "road trips." Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress. A search for "nerd comedy" brings up "The Big Bang Theory," but "comedy about nerds" does not. And a search for "Modern Family episode on basketball" doesn't bring up the episode titled "Basketball." YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually — too much work for a service that promises simplicity. One big plus: YouTube's unlimited DVR will store recordings for nine months, long enough for entire seasons of network shows. Sony's PlayStation Vue — the only similar service offering an unlimited online DVR — offers only 28 days of storage, nowhere near enough for binge-watching. YouTube TV works on phones, tablets and laptop browsers. Watching on an actual TV requires Google's Chromecast, an inexpensive streaming stick you control with your phone. (Early subscribers get one for free.) ___ ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY This being Google, your viewing and search histories might be mined for targeted advertising. You can suspend tracking in the settings, though that will hinder personalized recommendations. (It's too early to tell if that's a loss or not, though some of the early recommendations have been spot on.) You can share your subscription with five friends or relatives in your household, with three simultaneous streams allowed. No need to share passwords; they sign in with their own Google accounts. Recordings and recommendations are kept separate, so your roommates can't make fun of you for bingeing "The Real Housewives."       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business The Canadian Press 2017         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   AURAK Signs MoU with OAIRO Alliance Triton Aviation Finance Announces That It is Considering Strategic Alternatives FANUC Introduces R-30iB Plus Robot Controller           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

It’s even better if you take advantage of its numerous useful features. Many users never think to adjust default settings. By customizing Google Calendar to your needs, you can save time Save Your Time With 10 Underused Google Features Save Your Time With 10 Underused Google Features Google's tools and services do everything for us. But there are a lot of features that go underused. Save a few seconds and get more done with the Google tools you use every day. Read More and be more organized in the long run.

However, you will see several others you can customize. To access the settings for your default calendar on the web, go to calendar.google.com, log into your account, click the Settings (gear icon) from the top navigation, and select Settings. Make sure you are on the General tab and click the Save button after any changes. Default and Custom Views Do you find yourself constantly changing to the Day or Week View when you first sign in? Or maybe you would prefer to see a three-day instead of a five-day view. You can adjust both of these settings. Default View You can choose from day, week, month, custom, and agenda views as your default. Just scroll down to Default View and pick your preference. Custom View Right below the Default View setting is an option to set the Custom View. You can choose from 2–7 days or 2–4 weeks. Your choice will replace the default five-day view on your main calendar screen. Local Weather Are you planning a weekend getaway or business trip? You can use the local weather option to pop a forecast for the next few days right onto your calendar. This eases planning and lets you stay within Google Calendar to get your forecast. Just scroll down to enter your Location with city and state or zip code. Then, below that enable either Celsius or Fahrenheit for your preferred temperature. This puts a small icon onto your calendar for each day showing sun, clouds, or rain. You can also either put your mouse over the icon or click on it to see the high and low temperatures for the day. If you want to make sure those you have shared your calendar with see this information, click the Copy to Calendar link.

Invitation Options Do you receive event invitations that pop onto your calendar even though you have not accepted? And, you have no interest in attending them? Changing one simple default setting can save you from a cluttered calendar of events you will never attend. You can change this in the Automatically add invitations to my calendar setting. You can choose Yes to have all events displayed or No to have none at all. An in-between option will display the event, but not send a notification to the coordinator until you respond with Yes or Maybe. Two items to note on this setting. First, if you choose the No setting you will not see events you want to attend until you respond with Yes. Second, if you have shared your calendar, others will see those events even if you have not responded yet. Default Event Duration and Speedy Meetings Do you prefer to set the end time for events as you create them? Or would you like to encourage quick meetings for your employees? You can easily set your default duration and include the option to create Speedy Meetings. Default Event Duration You can choose from No end time to 15 minutes and up to 120 minutes for your events by default. This is handy if you prefer to pick end times without a default or always schedule one-hour meetings. Make your choice in the Default Event Duration drop-down box. Speedy Meetings Google Calendar has a feature to assist you with meeting efficiency. If you are in a position where you must attend consecutive meetings, this can be convenient to get you there on time. Mark the checkbox for Speedy Meetings and then the duration will be adjusted per your default. 30-minute meetings will end five minutes early, one-hour and longer meetings will end 10 minutes early. This default setting will set durations as 25, 50, 80, or 110 minutes. The intent is for you and your participants to wrap up quickly so you can move onto the next meeting or task. Settings for Your Other Calendars You might create, import, or access shared and public calendars Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar A calendar keeps every aspect of your life focused in one place, allowing you to worry less and accomplish more. Here are some useful ways to import important information into your Google Calendar. Read More . If you set up one on your own, you have complete control. But you can also make a few adjustments to other calendars to make them more useful to you. To access your other calendars on the web, click the Settings (gear icon) from the top navigation and select Settings. Click the Calendars tab and you will see those that you can view and modify along with those you can only view. Change the Display Name What if you would like your spouse’s calendar to show their nickname or the Holidays calendar to be called Celebrations. For shared and public calendars, you can change the name displayed for your viewing. Click on the calendar, change the Calendar Name at the top, and hit Save. Edit Notification Settings Would you like to receive a daily agenda via email or find out when your spouse cancels an event on their calendar? Any calendars that allow you to adjust the notification settings will display a link in that column. Once you click that link, you have a variety of options. At the top, you can choose to be notified via email for timed and all-day events. Just click the Add a notification link and select the amount of time before the event to receive the notification. In the next section, you can pick how you would like to be kept up-to-date with the calendar. You can mark the checkboxes next to new, changed, or canceled events as well as event responses and a daily agenda. You will then receive an email for those you have chosen. Click Save and you’re set. Shared Calendar Options What if you hire a new employee and want to share your calendar? Or, maybe you want to let your spouse make changes to events on your calendar? If you have shared your own calendars, you can adjust those settings at any time. While still in the Calendars section, click the Shared: Edit Settings link for your calendar. You can quickly add a person by entering their email address or remove someone by clicking the trash can. For new people you add and those already listed, you can adjust the permission settings. Open the permissions drop-down box and then make your choice. You can allow that person to make changes and manage sharing options, only make changes to events, view only your free and busy times, or see all event details. Since these permissions can be adjusted differently for each person you share with, it can be very convenient for work situations. For example, you might want your boss to see all event details, but your employees to view just free and busy times. Calendar and Event Colors Do you want your work events to show up in a bold red color, but personal ones to display in sunny yellow? By default, the color assigned to a calendar will display events in that same color. If you only use one calendar, then this is probably not an issue for you. However, if you have more than one of your own and access to shared and public calendars, consider changing their colors for better organization. This is done on your main Google Calendar page. Simply select the arrow next to the calendar that you want to change in the left navigation. Then, pick your color and that’s it. Color-coding your calendars and events helps you to see what is on your schedule with a quick glance. Which Default Settings Do You Find Most Helpful? While many of the default settings can be obvious, people do not often change them. Either they are unaware that these changes can be made or simply have not taken the time to do so. But if you use Google Calendar regularly How to Make Google Calendar Collaboration Even Smarter How to Make Google Calendar Collaboration Even Smarter There are many ways to make Google Calendar smarter. Here are eight tools to make your schedule work better for you with minimal effort on your part. Read More , then setting it up just the way you want it is essential.

Pulling information from PolitiFact, a website dedicated to fact-checking U.S. politics, as well Snopes, another fact-checking website, this time dedicated to debunking urban legends, the company will now display information on whether something a website or news piece claims is accurate. Google first added fact-checking functionality to Search back in October of last year. At that point, the feature was only available to search engine users in the U.S. and U.K. In addition, at that point, Google had only partnered with Jigsaw. The company later expanded the availability of the feature to other countries this past February. Notably, the fact checks do not come directly from Google; instead, the company is depending on third-party organizations to do the hard work of vetting information. The company also notes its sources may sometimes contradict one another. “This information won’t be available for every search result, and there may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions,” says the company. “Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.” Source: Google Via: The Next Web Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Reddit Featured Articles CRTC reveals phase one of plan to transfer telephone subsidy to broadband funding Kik CEO says he wants to create a completely new payments experience in chat Electronic Arts pledges to invest $500 million in Montreal’s game industry over 10 years Poop Troop Emoji Keyboard provides you with a poop animation for every situation Graceful Explosion Machine is the first Canadian-developed Nintendo Switch game Sign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Thank you for your subscription Related Articles News Apr 6, 2017 3:16 PM EDT Support for self-dismissing notifications announced for Android O News Apr 7, 2017 2:07 PM EDT Doodling on screenshots might be possible in the future for all Android users News Apr 5, 2016 10:55 AM EDT Google’s new search feature will have you making animal noises News Mar 22, 2017 9:53 AM EDT Google adds handy shortcuts to Search Comments Cameron Davidson Nicely done!

The fad gadget you strap to your wrist has seen a precipitous fall in the last year. Pebble closed its doors after releasing a solid fitness tracker, and Fitbit has struggled (though we liked its new Fitbit Alta HR). There's also the fact that fitness trackers, while great for athletes, seem to not actually help most of us lose weight. Image: Fitbit Which means if you're desperate to track sleep or steps or how many calories you consume you might be better off sticking to your phone. If you've taken a dive into your phone's fitness apps lately, you'll have noticed it can track your steps, your runs, and even your sleep without any help. So really, what's the point of buying yourself a separate wearable? Maybe your phone is enough tracker Image: Apple All contemporary smartphones come packed with sensors, which help it sort out where you are on a map, what orientation you're holding the phone in, and so on. It turns out these tiny components can do a lot of fitness tracking, too. Both Google Fit and Apple Health, depending on your choice of OS, are capable of keeping tabs on the steps you've taken, the distance you've covered, and the calories you've burned as you make your way about your day. Image: Google Google Fit is the more fitness focused of the two platforms, as its name suggests. Try adding an activity and you get a hundred to choose from, including everything from water polo to backcountry skiing. A lot of these activities can only be tracked in a very loose way, but the options to record them are there. Apple Health gives a more rounded picture of your health, and while it doesn't have quite as many activity categories as its Google counterpart, it goes into more detail and depth. For example, it includes the option of tracking caffeine intake and glucose levels. Image: Strava What apps do you need to turn you phone into a tracker? You don't necessarily need another device to keep tabs on a lot of these extra measurements, but you do need extra apps. There's a pile of apps, from Strava to Runkeeper, that can measure walks, runs, and bike rides using only your mobile phone, and in a lot more depth than your phone's own software can. (Both Strava and Runkeeper can share data with either Google Fit or Apple Health if necessary.) Image: Sleep As Android And an app such as Instant Heart Rate Monitor (for iOS or Android) can measure your heart rate using the technology built into your phone's camera. It might not be as accurate or as comprehensive as using a device strapped to your wrist or your chest, but it can add new depths to your health tracking, and the apps come with plenty of useful options for analysis and assessment. Apps can use your phone's sensors to figure out just how much quality shuteye you're getting as well. Sleep as Android can judge how restful for night has been for Android, while Sleep Cycle is one of the best options for iPhones or iPads. That's a lot of data you can keep on top of using nothing but your phone and a well-chosen app or two, though admittedly, there's more manual input involved if you want to go beyond the basics of step counts and sleep times, and it will definitely drain your phone's battery a little faster. Yet, as your phone is usually always with you, you may not need that separate tracker. Why you might still want a fitness tracker Image: Fitbit If you do decide to pay extra for a dedicated fitness tracker, the first benefit you get is portability: you don't have to lug a 15cm phone around on your morning jog, because a snug wristband or a tracker clipped to your pocket is doing all the tracking for you. With many smartwatches now including GPS, you can track your location too. Smartphones might feel like extensions of our natural bodies these days, but for some high-intensity activities you really don't want to take your phone with you. From running around on a soccer pitch to doing laps of the pool, the more advanced your fitness activity, the more a dedicated tracker starts to make sense. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And by fitness tracker we also mean smartwatch with advanced fitness tracking capabilities — being able to glance at your wrist as you hit the home straight of a 5K run is much more convenient than trying to fish your phone our of your pocket. The latest fitness trackers also bring more sensors and more accurate sensors to the table: whether it's the continuous heart rate tracking of the Apple Watch or the altimeter, barometer, and compass built into the Garmin Fenix 3, you can usually expand on the monitoring capabilities of your phone with a dedicated wearable. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo That often translates into less time spent manually inputting data — if there's one sticking point likely to interfere with your fitness tracking goals, it's having to enter data manually. It's a job that just never gets done, or doesn't get done often enough, and you don't have to worry about it if you're wearing a device that knows the difference between a gym session and a jog without being told. Of course there are a wide range of fitness trackers out there, some of which do a better job than others at keeping tabs on what you're doing, but generally speaking you get more automation and more detail with an extra device to help your phone along. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And all that's before you get to the app and software that comes with your tracker, which you may well prefer to the built-in offerings from Apple and Google — Fitbit's bundled app is particularly handy and gives you a detailed breakdown of your stats on the web as well as on your phone. The big downside to a fitness tracker? It's another gadget you'll need to be charging every day (or week), and the majority of trackers are big ugly rubber bands. Those are nearly as aesthetically pleasing as a smartphone in your back pocket. Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

Fitness Food Health Love Beauty Workout Finder Culture News Subscribe Subscribe Get 6 issues for just $5 Subscribe Subscribe Newsletter Wellness, Meet Inbox Sign up Now Subscribe Subscribe Culture|April 8, 2017| By  Erin Reimel| Brought to you by The Department of Labor Is Alleging "Extreme" Gender Pay Discrimination at Google Google has presented itself as a champion of pay equality. Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Getty Images We've seen what the gender pay gap looks like— and it's not pretty. Women getting paid equally to their male counterparts seems like it should be a non-issue in 2017, but in many fields—like, infamously, the male-dominated Silicon Valley tech world—women are getting the short end of the stick. Now, a Department of Labor investigation alleges that Google has a huge pay gap issue—even for the tech industry. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Janette Wipper, a Department of Labor regional director, testified in court in San Francisco on Friday, according to the Guardian. The hearing pertained to the lawsuit the Department of Labor filed against Google when the tech giant refused to provide job and salary history for employees to prove it's complying with the equal opportunity laws. As a federal contractor, according to TechCrunch, Google is "required to let the government review documents and other relevant information that is relevant to the company’s compliance with equal employment laws." “The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters,” Janet Herold, a regional solicitor for the Department of Labor, told The Guardian. “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry,” she added. Google has previously said that the Department of Labor is going overboard with their request, according to TechCrunch, and that providing the information requested would be a violation of employees' privacy. The tech company has also previously positioned itself as a champion of salary parity, tweeting the following on Equal Pay Day: "We're proud to share that we have closed the gender pay gap globally, and also provide equal pay across races in the U.S., according to our annual compensation analysis. At our re:Work site, we're sharing some of the lessons we've learned, to help other business close the pay gap." https://twitter.com/Google/status/849247401110097920/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Fthecut%2F2017%2F04%2Fdept-of-labor-accuses-google-of-extreme-gender-pay-gap.html Google also made a statement to The Guardian rejecting the Department of Labor's allegations: “We vehemently disagree with [Wipper’s] claim. Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders, and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the [Department of Labor] hasn’t provided any data or shared its methodology.” The Department of Labor's allegations come after finding pay disparities in 2015 salaries, which prompted further investigation. Until Google complies with the government audit, the labor department has requested that the court cancel any of Google's federal contracts and stop the company from future government business until it complies with the investigation.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business. I would be surprised if they don't already have a plan in place to cut the labor cost of delivering a package by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years. » reply Online retail Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:40. Will indeed profit nicely, but it’s small compared to personal transportation. Delivery services around the world are a few hundred billion dollars. Personal transport is 5 trillion. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Robocars Recently we’ve seen two essays by people I highly respect in the field of AI and robotics. Their points are worthy of reading, but in spite of my respect, I have some differences of course. The first essay comes from Andrew Ng, head of AI (and thus the self-driving car project) at Baidu. You will find few who can compete with Andrew when it comes to expertise on AI. (Update: This essay is not recent, but I only came upon it recently.) In Wired he writes that Self-Driving Cars Won’t Work Until We Change Our Roads—And Attitudes. And the media have read this essay as being much more strong about changing the roads than he actually writes. I have declared it to be the “first law of robocars” that you don’t change the infrastructure. You improve your car to match the world you are given, you don’t ask the world to change to help your cars. There are several reasons I promote this rule: As soon as you depend on a change in the world in order to drive safely, you have vastly limited where you can deploy. You declare that your technology will be, for a very long time, a limited area technology. You have to depend on, and wait for others to change the world or their attitudes. It’s beyond your control. When it comes to cities and infrastructure, the pace of change is glacial. When it comes to human behaviour, it can be even worse. While it may seem that the change to infrastructure is clearer and easier to plan, the reality is almost assuredly the opposite. That’s because the clever teams of developers, armed with the constantly improving technologies driven by Moore’s law, have the ability to solve problems in a way that is much faster than our linear intuitions suggest. Consider measuring traffic by installing tons of sensors, vs. just getting everybody to download Waze. Before Waze, the sensor approach seemed clear, if expensive. But it was wrong. As noted, Andrew Ng does not actually suggest that much change to the infrastructure. He talks about: Having road construction crews log changes to the road before they do them Giving police and others who direct traffic a more reliable way to communicate their commands to cars Better painting of lane markers More reliable ways to learn the state of traffic lights Tools to help humans understand the actions and plans of robocars Logging construction The first proposal is one I have also made, because it’s very doable, thanks to computer technology. All it requires at first blush is a smartphone app in the hands of construction crews. Before starting a project, they would know that just as important as laying out cones and signs is opening the app and declaring the start of a project. The phone has a GPS and can offer a selection of precise road locations and log it. Of course, the projects should be logged even before they begin, but because that’s imperfect, smartphone logging is good enough. You could improve this by sticking old smartphones in all the road construction machines (old phones are cheap and there are only so many machines) so that any time a machine stops on a road for very long, it sends a message to a control center. Even emergency construction gets detected this way. Even with all that, cars still need to detect changes to the road (that’s easy with good maps) and cones and machines. Which they can do. Police redirection I think the redirection problem is more difficult. Many people redirect traffic, even civilians. However, I would be interested to see Ng’s prediction on how hard it is to get neural network based recognizers to understand all the common gestures. Considering that computers are now getting better at reading sign languages, which are much more complex, I am optimistic here. But in any event, there is another solution for the cases where the system can’t understand the advice, namely calling in an operator in a remote control center, which is what Nissan plans to do, and what we do at Starship. Unmanned cars, with no human to help, will just avoid data dead zones. If somehow they get to them, there can be other solutions, which are imperfect but fine when the problem is very rare, such as a way for the traffic manager to speak to the car (after all, spoken language understanding is now close to a solved problem for limited vocabulary problems.) Better lanes Here I disagree with Andrew. His statement may be a result of efforts to drive on roads without maps, even though Baidu has good map expertise. Google’s car has a map of the texture of the road. It knows where the cracks and jagged lane markers are. The car actually likes degrading lane markers. It’s perfectly painted straight and smooth roads which confuse it (though only slightly, and not enough to cause a problem.) So no, I think that better line painting is not on the must-do list. Seeing lights He’s right, seeing lights can be challenging, though the better cars are getting good at it. The simple algorithm is “you don’t go if you don’t confirm green.” That means you don’t run a red but you could block traffic. If that’s very rare it’s OK. We can consider infrastructure to solve that, though I’m wary. Fortunately, if the city is controlling its lights with a central computer, you don’t have to alter the traffic light itself (which is hard,) you can just query the city, in those rare cases, for when the light will be changing. I think that problem will be solved, but I also think it may well be solved just by better cameras. Good robocars know exactly where all the lights are, and they know where they are, and thus they know exactly what pixels in a video image are from the light, even if the sun is behind it. (Good robocars also know where the sun is and will avoid stopping in a place where there is no light they can see without the sun right behind it.) Working with people How cars interact with people is one of Andrew Ng’s points and the central point of Rodney Brooks’ essay Unexpected Consequences of Self Driving Cars. Already many of the car companies have had fun experimenting with that, putting displays on the outside of cars of various sorts. While cars don’t have the body language and eye contact of human drivers, I don’t predict a problem we can’t solve with good effort. Brooks’ credentials are also superb, as founder of iRobot (Roomba) and Rethink Robotics (Baxter) as well as many accomplishments as an MIT professor. His essay delves into one of the key questions I have wondered about for some time — how to deal with a world where things do not follow the rules, and where there are lots of implicit and changing rules and interactions. Google discovered the first instant of this when their car got stuck at a 4 way stop by being polite. They had to program the car to assert its right to go in order to handle the stop. Likewise, you need to speed to be a good citizen on many of our roads today. His key points are as follows: There is a well worked out dance between pedestrians and cars, that varies greatly among different road types, with give and take, and it’s not suitable for machines yet. People want to know a driver has seen them before stepping near or certainly in front of a vehicle. People jaywalk, and even expect cars to stop for them when they do on some streets. In snowy places, people walk on the street when the sidewalk is not shoveled. Foot traffic can be so much that timid cars can’t ever get out of sidestreets or driveways. Nice pedestrians often let them out. They will hand signal their willingness to yield or use body language. Sometimes people just stand at the corner or edge of the road, and you can’t tell if they are standing there or getting ready to cross. People setting cars to circle rather than park People might jump out of their car to do something, leaving it in the middle of the street blocking traffic, where today they would be unwilling to double park. People might abuse parking spots by having a car “hold” them for quick service when they want to leave an event. Cars will grab early spots to pick up children at schools. Brooks starts with one common mistake — he has bought into the “levels” defined by SAE, even claiming them to be well accepted. In fact, many people don’t accept them, especially the most advanced developers, and I outlined recently why there is only one level, namely unmanned operation, and so the levels are useless as a taxonomy. Instead the real taxonomy in the early days will be the difference between mobility on demand services (robotaxi) and self-drive enabled high end luxury cars. Many of his problems involve privately owned cars and selfish behaviour by their owners. Many of those behaviours don’t make sense in a world with robotaxis. I think it’s very likely that the robotaxis come first, and come in large numbers first, while some imagine it’s the other way around. Unintended consequences Brooks is right that there will be unintended consequences, and the technology will be put to uses nobody thought of. People will be greedy, and antisocial, that can be assured. Fortunately, however, people will work out solutions, in advance, to anything you can think of or notice just by walking down the street or thinking about issues for a few days. The experienced developers have been thinking about these problems for decades now, and cars like Google’s have driven for 300 human lifetimes of driving, and that number keeps increasing. They note every unusual situation they encounter on every road they can try to drive, and the put it into the simulator if it’s important. They’ve already seen more situations than any one human will encounter on those roads, though they certainly haven’t driven all the types of road in the world. But they will, before they certify as safe for deployment on such roads. As I noted, only the “level 4” situation is real. Level 5 is an aspirational science-fiction goal, and the others are unsafe. Key to the improved thinking on “levels” it is no longer the amount of human supervision needed that makes the difference, it is the types of roads and situations you can handle. All these vehicles will only handle a subset of roads, and that is what everybody plans. If there is a road that is too hard, they just won’t drive it. Fortunately, there are lots of road subsets out there that are very, very useful and make economic sense. For a while, many companies planned only to do highways, which are the simplest road subset of all, except for the speed. A small subset, but everybody agrees it’s valuable. So the short answer is, solutions will be found to these problems if the roads they occur on are commercially necessary. If they are not necessary, the solutions will be delayed until they can be found, though that’s probably not too long. As noted above, many people do expect systems to be developed to allow dialogue between robocars and pedestrians or other humans. One useful tool is gaze detection — just as a cheap flash camera causes “red eye” in photos, machines shining infrared light can easily tell if you are looking at them. Eye contact in that direction is detectable. There have been various experiments in sending information in the reverse direction. Some cars have lasers that can paint lines on the road. Others can display text. Some have an LED ribbon surrounding them that shows all the objects and people tracked by the car, so people can understand that they are being perceived. You can also flash a light back directly at people to return their eye contact — I see you and I see that you saw me. Over time, we’ll develop styles of communication, and they will get standarized. It’s not essential to do that on day one; you just stay on the simpler roads until you know you can handle the others. Private cars will pause and pop out a steering wheel. Services like Uber will send you a human driver in the early days if the car is going somewhere the systems can’t drive, or they might even let you drive part of it. Such incrementalism is the only way it can ever work. People taking advantage of timidity of robocars I believe there are solutions to some of the problems laid out. One I have considered is pedestrians and others who take advantage of the naturally conservative and timid nature of a robocar. If people feel they can safely cut off or jaywalk in front of robocars, they will. And the unmanned cars will mostly just accept that, though only about 10% of all cars should be unmanned at any given time. The cars with passengers are another story. Those passengers will be bothered if they are cut off, or forced to brake quickly. They will spill their coffee. And they will fight back. Citizen based strong traffic code enforcement Every time you jump in front of such a car, it will of course have saved the video and other sensor data. It’s always doing that. But the passenger might tell the car, “Please save that recent encounter. E-mail it to the police.” The police will do little with it at first, but in time, especially since there are rich people in these cars, they will throw a face recognizer and licence plate recognizer on the system that gets the videos. They will notice that one person keeps jaywalking right in front of the cars and annoying the passengers. Or the guy who keeps cutting off the cars as though they are not there because they always brake. They will have video of him doing it 40 times, or 100. And at that point, they will do something. The worst offender will get identified and get an E-mail from police. We have 50 videos of you doing this. Here are 50 tickets. Then the next, and the next until nobody wants to get to the top of the list. This might actually create pressure the other way — a street that belongs only to the cars and excludes the non-car user. A traffic code that is enforced to the letter because every person inconvenienced has an ability to file a complaint trivially. We don’t want that either, but we can control that balance. I actually look forward to fixing one of the dynamics of jaywalking that doesn’t work. Often, people like to jaywalk and a car is approaching. They want to have the car pass at full speed and then walk behind it — everybody is more comfortable behind a car than in front of one. But the driver gets paranoid and stops, and eventually you uncomfortably cross in front, annoyed at that and that you stopped somebody you didn’t intend to stop. I suspect robocars will be able to handle this dynamic better, predicting when people might actually be on a path to enter their lane, but not slowing down for stopped pedestrians (adults at least) and trust them to manage their crossing. Children are a different matter. People being selfish with robocars Brooks wonders about people doing selfish things with their robocars. Here, he mostly talks about privately owned robocars, since most of what he describes would not or could not happen with a robotaxi. There will be some private cars so we want to think about this. A very common supposition I see here and elsewhere is the idea of a car that circles rather than parking. Today, operating a car is about $20/hour so that’s already completely irrational, and even when robocar operation drops to $8/hour or less, parking is going to be ridiculously cheap and plentiful so that’s not too likely. There could be competition for spots in very busy areas (schools, arenas etc.) which don’t have much space for pick-up and drop-off, and that’s another area where a bit of traffic code could go a long way. Allow facilities to make a rule: “No car may enter unless its passenger is waiting at the pick-up spot” with authority to ticket and evict any car that does otherwise. Over time, such locations will adjust their pick-up spots to the robocar world and become more like Singapore’s airport, which provides amazing taxi throughput with no cab lines by making it all happen in parallel. Of course, cars would wait outside the zone but robocars can easily double and triple park without blocking the cars they sit in the path of. Robocars waiting for passengers at busy locations will be able to purchase waiting spaces for less than the cost of circling, and then serve their customers or owners. If necessary, market prices can be put on the prized close waiting spaces to solve any problems of scarcity. So when can it happen? Robocars will come to different places at different times. They will handle different classes of streets at different times. They will handle different types of interactions with pedestrians and other road users at different times. Where you live will dictate when you can use it and how you can use it. Vendors will push at the most lucrative routes to start, then work down. There will be many problems that are difficult at first, and the result will be the early cars just don’t go on those sorts of streets or into those sorts of situations. Human driving, either by the customer or something like an Uber driver, will fill in the gaps. Long before then, teams will have encountered or thought of just about any situation you’ve seen, and any situation you’ve likely thought of in a short amount of time. They will have programmed every variation of that situation they can imagine into their simulators to see what their car does. They will use this to grow the network of roads the cars handle every day. Even if at the start, it is not a network of use to you, it won’t be too long before it becomes that, at first for some of your rides, and eventually for most or all. » brad's blog Bicycle use Submitted by Russell de Silva (not verified) on Wed, 2017-01-18 12:15. I'm hopeful that if robocar interactions with pedestrians and cyclists prove to be safer than those driven by humans, then we will see a big surge in bicycle use for short trips. I have at various times commuted by bike to work, but by far the biggest turn off is the lack of safety. While the benefits to the environment of one less car will be greatly reduced if very small and low performance electric vehicles become the norm, the fitness benefits are obvious. One downside to this might be that bicycle use becomes so common that they impede robocar transport especially before and after school. Add in the advent of e-bikes and commuting by bike over larger distances becomes more attractive. It will be interesting to see if any of this comes to pass. » reply Bike is helped Submitted by brad on Wed, 2017-01-18 18:04. Well, it’s a long time before the human drivers are off the road, many decades at least, so you won’t feel perfectly safe for a while. But one big plus is the ability to easily mix bike and car, with or without robot delivered bikes: Take a car one way and return by bicycle. (Either one way rental bike or bike that came in the car to give you that option.) Ride car into town. Stop part way and finish trip on bike, either for exercise or because traffic is heavy and bike will be faster or pay fewer road tolls. Ditto in reverse. Ride from work until tired, then summon car on phone, which pulls up next to you (tracking as you bike) and then you (and the bike, possibly) get into the car, which is designed with a rack. Also possible to use e-bikes for super energy efficiency and pleasant rides on nice days » reply Classes of streets Submitted by cxed (not verified) on Fri, 2017-01-20 23:22. "They will handle different classes of streets at different times." I have always disagreed with your assertion that computer drivers must be able to drive like human drivers. I believe that is a false hope. It reminds me of orinthopters - seems like a "natural" idea but ultimately not a good one, to chase evolution. But perhaps our opinions will converge with the "classes of streets" idea. Eventually there must be an equilibrium where the last .001% of humanness AI designers are trying to impart to the cars is more expensive than just replacing those roads still classified as problematic. » reply Like human drivers Submitted by brad on Sat, 2017-01-21 04:50. Where do you think I said computer drivers must drive like human ones? I have never said that. I (and many others) have said they should be able to attain a safety record, in their operating domain, that is at least as good as human records, and probably better. » reply Perhaps I misunderstand Submitted by cxed (not verified) on Sat, 2017-01-21 08:50. This may be an incorrect interpretation, but when I see something like this... "I have declared it to be the “first law of robocars” that you don’t change the infrastructure." ...I can only conclude that cars need to get along as well with what we've got as humans. Maybe you can better clarify how cars will be able to deal with human infrastructure if we agree that strong AI to drive cars is not right around the corner. My belief is that very small enhancements to the infrastructure could save enormous AI R&D. Throughout history we've made massive changes to infrastructure if the payoff is good (and for autonomous cars it is). The amount and pace of change needed to allow cars at all (say, from 1925 to 1975) is far greater and faster than anything that would need to be done to completely solve autonomous driving. New topic: I'm curious about your opinion of Udacity's nanodegree in "autonomous car engineering". Thanks. » reply Small changes Submitted by brad on Sun, 2017-01-22 07:45. Even the most tiny of changes to infrastructure take many decades to become universal. The progress in AI is much faster. Nothing here involves strong AI. Certainly being able to handle missing lane lines or strange signal arrangements or odd signs even comes close to that. The answer is mapping. Cars drive the roads (driven by humans and later by software.) Weak AI turns the scans into maps. Live human beings review the maps and data to deal with situations that software can’t handle. If such situations are few, the cost is very reasonable, but even if humans have to review every inch it is still cheaper than changing the infrastructure. And much faster, with no waiting for municipalities to get it done. It’s cheaper to map any road than to physically alter it. It’s easy for the system to see if the real road differs from the map. There the car can rely on its driving ability without an accurate map, or call on help from passengers, or call on help from a remote operations center, or pull off the road if it’s unmanned, in a radio dead zone and the first such car to encounter the changed road. Such situations should be very rare. » reply Infrastructure changes Submitted by SEK (not verified) on Mon, 2017-01-23 07:29. Brad, I see at least two drivers to gradual infrastructure changes: - There will always be a push for even safer transportation. Every life lost in one too much. Infrastructure changes that demonstrates to increase safety will be gradually implemented. This will probably happen in the next decades in parallel to AVs adoption. - The expansion of ODDs can be accelerated by infrastructure changes. E.g. that street that is out of ODD in the sunset hours may adopt a connected traffic light if it will change the ODD status and better serve consumers in that area. Living in region with harsh winters, I'm always wondering about ODDs in snow storm days and the commercial viability of AVs if all snow days are out of ODDs. May be infrastructure changes could expand ODDs in this case. » reply Gradual implementation Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-01-23 15:25. Sure, they might happen, but the problem is this. A car either meets the bar of “safe enough” on the roads or it doesn’t. Safe enough is still not perfect, so there is always room for improvement, and people should work on those improvements. But you create the risk that people will say, “The cars are not safe enough unless they infrastructure meets this standard.” If so, you get cars that can only drive where you have improved the infrastructure. Which are essentially useless cars, or 1% of the utility of cars that can go most places. And they save 1% of the lives. Now the first cars will not go everywhere because they won’t handle every type of road. But it will be the builders of the car making that decision, and doing the effort to improve it. You don’t want a situation where you say, “Cars can’t go on a road until we repaint the stripes” because now you must wait for every local government to repaint the stripes. If you say, “Cars can’t go on a road until the maker of the car builds a driving system able to handle the badly painted stripes” then it’s up to the competing companies to solve the problem. And they solve it 10 times faster than the governments, and they solve it everywhere they compete. If you want to talk about a situation where the cars can handle 99% of the roads, and there is a 1% section where infrastructure improvements might gradually appear, that’s a little more workable. That would not apply to roads, but an example might be traffic lights. A car might be able to read 99% of traffic lights, but some might be arranged so poorly that the car can’t be sure it is reading the light properly. There, you could tell the cities, “please fix this traffic light, or make its state available over the internet” and wait for the city to do that. (But you would still be trying to see if you can improve the car to see the bad traffic light anyway.) There are two kinds of changes cities might do, though. The hardest is physical changes that need bureaucracy and money. Those will always be slow. Other changes are to virtual infrastructure, and can be funded by the car companies, who have the motive to do it. For example, if the change desired is the one that Andrew Ng (and I) have both suggested, that construction crews log in a database before they open up a construction site, that’s not too bad because the work is virtual — provide the cities with a mobile phone app and database that the crews can use. Even give them phones if need be. All the city has to do is make a law, and get the construction crews to add “log the opening of the site” in the checklist they already have for the procedures on starting road construction. » reply Level 4 Autonomy? Submitted by Alan Little (not verified) on Tue, 2017-01-24 03:25. So ... humans with little or no experience or practice at driving only get to practice driving on a dirt road in a blizzard? That's going to work well. Actually, the most terrified I've ever been driving was on an autobahn in Austria in a thunderstorm. Visibility was so bad I wanted to pull over but I couldn't see where the side of the road was, and I was driving so slowly I was scared of somebody rear-ending me. An autonomous car with radar, not dependent on vision alone, would have been far better equipped to be safe in that severe weather situation. » reply Only practice in bad situations Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-01-24 08:32. It is the expectation of many that the period where the cars can’t handle tough conditions is not a very long one, so we don’t have the time to breed a generation of drivers who have no experience and are called upon only when it is difficult. » reply RE: cost of operation Submitted by DensityDuck (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 16:36. "operating a car is about $20/hour " Please link to the source whenever you quote this figure, so that people can understand the assumptions that go into it. Like, the assumption that insurance cost scales linearly with miles driven, the assumption that maintenance for a Honda Civic costs as much as that for a BMW (and includes a full vehicle rebuild at 100,000 miles), and so on. You talk about parking being "ridiculously cheap and plentiful". WHERE? If you're suggesting "parking will be on the outskirts of town and robocars will automatically drive to/from there", well. So these cars will drive a half hour to the parking lot, charge your credit card to park for an hour, then drive *another* half hour back to pick you up. That's an hour of driving, just so that you can park your car instead of having it drive around for, um, an hour...? Also that you're *assuming* rich people (who are all over the place in your blog post, so I'll follow your discussion lead) would be so price-conscious at the less-than-$100 scale that they would rather sit around waiting for their car to show up than pay an extra twelve dollars and have it be right down the block and ready to go. » reply Cost per hour Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:34. Most major sources calculate car costs per mile, but I think hours are much better. (Other engines such as boats and aircraft are tracked in hours.) The truth is that driving on the highway costs less per mile than the city — engine is doing modest revs and getting much less wear because it is not constantly changing speed. $20/hour is a rough calculation from the typical 50 cent/mile and the reported average speed (city and highway) in the USA of 40mph. Obviously a more detailed analysis is worthwhile, and it will vary from car to car and driver to driver, as do the per mile costs that get calculated. Many cars do count their hours so it would be possible to build this data. But just like the 50 cent/mile number, this is a number for a mainstream low-cost car, not a BMW, and for that average American who does about 55-60% of miles on the highway (EPA’s number) Sensor laden cars of the future will be able to calculate their “age” with high accuracy. They will know exactly how many seconds the engine spent at what revs, how many hard brakings, how much time people sat in the seats etc. etc. Robotaxis, with high duty cycle, will be able to have much more regular numbers too. For parking, see my article on that which is cited. Parking will not be on the “outskirts” but may be a km or two from the most dense locations, at least for most of the day. Cars will do a math on the distance they must travel (and its cost) and the price quoted and the acceptable delay to get where they are going next. Rich people will pay $12 if they wish, but only a small fraction of parkers are rich. Many will be satisfied with this cheaper approach: Send the car 2km away where parking is 25 cents/hour to park for 7 hours. At close to quitting time (or on signal from user or user’s phone making AI-based guesses) bring the car close to the user, paying $3/hour to wait for an average of 30 minutes For the instances that doesn’t work and there is a sudden urgent need, get into a robotaxi and have the car and robotaxi converge on a convenient point to switch. In rare emergencies in the opposite direction of the car, use robotaxi all the way. This approach will cost only a couple of dollars per day. Per year that’s $600 vs. $3000 and only the more truly rich won’t find that attractive. $12/day for 250 days ($3,000) is 40% of the total non-parking cost of car ownership for the average family. For those who want to leave at the absolute peak time (5pm) taking a shared robotaxi out to meet your car will be actually a cheaper choice and the one the city may insist on to reduce congestion. Waiting spot prices will go up a lot at 5pm, but for those going out to get to their car, almost any empty seat going roughly that way is acceptable because your car will come meet you along the route the other passengers are going. Odds are, though, you might be sharing that ride with other people meeting their cars at the same parking lot. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Five of these were claimed to be standard-essential patents (SEPs) for various telecommunications standards, such as 3G and 4G. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute’s policy requires that a patentee declaring patents as standard-essential commits to licensing those patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. After proceedings began, in April 2014 Unwired Planet made an open offer to the defendants to license its entire global portfolio (SEPs and non-SEPs). However, Huawei, Samsung and Google denied infringement, argued that the patents were invalid and counterclaimed for revocation. The defendants also claimed that because of this, no licence was required, and that Unwired’s offer was not FRAND and so a breach of competition law. Unwired made a further offer in July 2014, only covering the company’s SEPs, but this was rejected as not meeting FRAND standards by the defendants. As a result of directions from the court, in June 2015 each side made certain open offers of licensing terms. Huawei contended that a UK SEP licence was an “inevitable and mandatory outcome”, while Unwired instead offered a worldwide licence. Google subsequently settled over the SEPs in the summer of 2015 and Samsung settled a year later. The main dispute that had to be resolved was whether and to what extent various terms on offer are or would be FRAND, with one key issue being the value of Unwired’s patents reflected in the royalty rates. Mr Justice Birss held that a worldwide licence would not be contrary to competition law and that “willing and reasonable parties” would agree on a worldwide licence.  “Therefore, Unwired Planet are entitled to insist on it. It follows that an insistence by Huawei on a licence with a UK-only scope is not FRAND,” he said. Birss added that an injunction ought to be granted because “Huawei stand before the court without a licence but have the means to become licensed open to them”. However, he explained that an injunction would not be granted now but be dealt with at a later hearing, once Unwired Planet has drawn up a full set of the terms of the worldwide licence incorporating the decisions made. Gary Moss, head of EIP Legal, and representative of Unwired, said: “As well as being a significant decision, and validation of Unwired’s licensing approach, this decision will be of great interest to the telecoms sector in general.” He explained that up until now, there has been a view that even if the infringing party is successfully sued, it would have to pay no more than the royalty rate it would have had to pay anyway and only for the countries in which it was sued.  “That gave an incentive for implementers to hold out in the hope of achieving a more favourable royalty rate,” said Moss. According to Moss, the judgment confirms that this need not be the case, and that the court will take a “commercially sensible, real-world” approach to such issues.   Did you enjoy reading this story? Sign up to our free daily newsletters and get stories like this sent straight to your inbox Huawei, Unwired Planet, mobile phones, patent, patent infringement, FRAND, English High Court, Editor's Picks Most read From forum-shopping to the UPC: 10 IP issues to watch in 2017 SCOTUS cheerleading decision brings sigh of relief for fashion innovators Impression v Lexmark: SCOTUS questions patent exhaustion rules Procter & Gamble sues oral goods business for patent infringement USITC investigates LG over graphics patent claim 3M hits Chinese company with patent, TM and copyright claim Organisations demand Trump ends USPTO hire freeze USITC investigates Toshiba and LG Republicans invoke ‘nuclear’ option over Trump SCOTUS nominee Federal Circuit blocks Chinese graduate from patent agent job Sign up for the newsletter Newsletter Your email * Links Home News Directory About Contact Privacy Policy Terms of Use Terms of Subscription WIPR Newton Media Ltd Kingfisher House 21-23 Elmfield Road Bromley BR1 1LT United Kingdom Email: info@newtonmedia.co.uk Follow @WorldIPReview Tweets by @WorldIPReview

Corey Booker, Andrew Cuomo, and yes, Oprah have already been mentioned. By far, the most interesting ticket for the Dems would be Al Franken/Jill Stein: Franken-Stein! Can you imagine the publicity surrounding this duo? I can already hear "Frankenstein" by Edgar Winter, being played at every Dem event for two years. Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein" will be shown on CNN and MSNBC repeatedly. Rachel Maddow will claim that she has Dr. Frankenstein's original documents for his creature. MSNBC's Chris Matthews will "get a tingle up my leg" if Franken-Stein becomes reality. As a conservative, even I would have to vote for this ticket - it's just too rich! This would unite the country like never before and considering the sad state of candidates the Dems have this would reignite their party. I can see the campaign signs now, "Put a Monster in the White House"! BOB MORRIS Utica   Tenney illogical on Internet vote Rep. Claudia Tenney's recent vote of yes on S.J. Res. 34, allowing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to collect and sell user data, is a shameful example of ignorance in technology and putting corporate interests before her constituents. In Tenney’s public statement for voting yes, she makes the head-scratching illogical comparisons between sites like Facebook and Google with ISPs. The argument basically was: “those sites don't require opt-ins, so why should ISPs?" It is true sites like Google and Facebook do collect and sell data of users. Yet, the major difference between these sites and ISPs is a user can opt out of using those sites. I can opt out of Facebook by not creating an account. I can also opt out of Google by using another less intrusive search engine. This is not possible with ISPs. There are two cable service providers in Utica, Verizon and Time Warner (now Spectrum), both will foreseeably collect data. By voting yes, Tenney effectively allowed ISPs to change from service corporations that provide access to the internet to become the largest data collection and marketing corporations, all for a measly $8,500 in political donations from ISPs. PAUL W. KOHAN New Hartford   We can play a role in climate change This is in response to a March 29 letter about climate change. While I may not have a PhD in climatology, I do hold a BS in geoscience so maybe I can enlighten you and others. Carbon dioxide, a scientifically proven greenhouse gas, that is to say a gas that traps heat within our atmosphere, is at a high concentration. According to NASA, CO2 levels in our atmosphere have not exceeded 300ppm (parts per million) in the past 400,000 years. CO2 emissions do come from natural sources such as volcanic activity, however, humans add to that through vehicle emissions, power plants, etc. Because of human action, the current CO2 concentration exceeds 400ppm. Many people’s confusion comes from the fact that natural climate change does occur and happens in a cyclic pattern. But humans are drastically adding to greenhouse gas concentrations. Alas, I only mention one tiny part of climate change. If you’re interested, do a Google search on permafrost and methane. It does not take a scientist or a PhD to understand the perils of human action. We cannot stop climate change from naturally occurring, but we can do our part to stop pouring gas on a fire. MAXWELL DARMAN Utica   Don't leave the people out of governing By pulling the plug on “Trumpcare,” House Speaker Paul Ryan essentially admitted that Republicans don’t know how to govern. Because Republicans believe “government is the problem,” they fail to understand that governing means providing enhancements of life and liberty. Governing is not defined by undermining agencies like the EPA. Governing is not defined by loosening requisite regulations and sabotaging consumer protection mechanisms so that 1 percent of the population reaps profits by exploiting the rest of us. Governing is listening and acting upon the opinions, ideas and concerns expressed by ordinary people in Town Halls and other forums. Governing is finding ways to enhance, rather than restrict, the right to vote and the right to address grievances through public protest and a free press. Governing is finding solutions to real problems like lack of affordable healthcare or the plight of homeless children. Republicans are misleading millions into believing citizens will benefit by adding $54 billion to the military budget while de-funding 61 social programs like Planned Parenthood, Public Radio and community development. Republicans fail at governing because they do not understand that government of the people, by the people and for the people is the very definition and spirit of governance.

Microsoft's Cortana powered Harman Kardon smart speaker is called the Invoke? Posted: 08 Apr 2017, 15:34, by Alan F. Share Tweet Share Tags : Microsoft-Microsoft+ One of the most innovative new products of the last few years has been the Amazon Echo. This is a smart speaker that features cloud based personal assistant Alexa. The Echo led Google to come up with Google Home, which features Google Assistant inside. Last year, we told you that Microsoft was going to make its own smart speaker that would come with Cortana playing the role of virtual assistant. A Harman Kardon speaker will bring outstanding sound quality to the device. Two months ago, the product received its Wi-Fi Alliance certification, and now we might have a name for the smart speaker. The device will be called the Harman Kardon Invoke, or the HK Invoke according to information that was published today. Another new piece of news involves Skype integration with the Invoke. With the Microsoft owned messaging app on board, users will be able to invoke the name of a friend or family member (see what we did there?) and have a phone conversation with that person right from the smart speaker. This is something that Google Home and Amazon Echo do not offer at the moment. In addition, Invoke will play music from third party apps including Microsoft's own Groove Music. Like the Amazon Echo, activating the HK Invoke will set off a colorful ring at the top of the unit. This way, users have a visual clue to let them know that the device is listening, and is awaiting a verbal command. With a Harman Kardon speaker and the Skype integration, Microsoft will probably price the Invoke at a premium to the Google Home and Amazon Echo. Still, that isn't too bad for Microsoft. In a competitive market you can price yourself as the cheapest option and do great. You can also price yourself as the high-end unit and still do well. The worst place to be in this scenario is in the middle since the public won't be able to tell where your product belongs from the pricing. And that means that Microsoft's smart speaker will probably shake things up once it launches, most likely later this year. source: MSPoweruser Verizon rolls out new Android 7.1.2 Nougat update for its Pixel phones 08 Apr Prev news Google moves Keep shopping list functionality to Google Home and Express 08 Apr Next news Close newer posts The sapphire edition of the HTC U Ultra will sell in Europe for €849 08 Apr EU wants to offer Finland €2.6M for laid-off Nokia workers 08 Apr King to develop Activision's second Call of Duty mobile game for 2017 08 Apr Google moves Keep shopping list functionality to Google Home and Express 08 Apr Now reading: Microsoft's Cortana powered Harman Kardon smart speaker is called the Invoke?

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Lifestyle Here’s what makes a global brand valuable and the key drivers behind its strength Here’s what makes a global brand valuable and the key drivers behind its strength For the ranking, a brand’s strength is assessed (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, preference, sustainability and margins) to determine what proportion of a business’ revenue is contributed by the brand. By: FE Bureau | New Delhi | Published: April 9, 2017 2:29 AM This year, Google has overtaken Apple to become the “most valuable global brand,” as per the rankings. Just like last year, technology brands dominated the top 10. EACH YEAR, valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance values the brands of thousands of the world’s biggest companies. For the ranking, a brand’s strength is assessed (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, preference, sustainability and margins) to determine what proportion of a business’ revenue is contributed by the brand. This is projected into perpetuity and discounted to determine the brand’s value. This year, Google has overtaken Apple to become the “most valuable global brand,” as per the rankings. Just like last year, technology brands dominated the top 10. The ranking is based on interviews with more than three million consumers plus data on the financial and business performance of each company, using data from Bloomberg and the company Kantar Worldpanel. Here, we list the top 10 brands in the world and what makes them valuable… Google Brand value: $109.4 bn Last year’s rank: 2 The last time Google was at the top of the ranking of the most valuable brands in the world was six years ago. Its ranking in the most valuable brands was helped by a 20% growth in ad revenues. As per Brand Finance, the company “remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income.” Though Google has largely benefitted from increased revenues, its brand strength score is also a factor in its success. Apple Brand value: $107.1 bn Last year’s rank: 1 After five years at the top, Apple lost its crown in 2017. As per Brand Finance, Apple “has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected.” It further explained that the tech giant has “over-exploited the goodwill” of its customers, namely because of its failure to generate significant revenues from products like the Apple Watch. Also Watch: Amazon Brand value: $106.3 bn Last year’s rank: 3 Amazon’s significant brand value growth meant it came close to securing the top spot in 2017. It continues to be a force in reshaping the retail market and started to move into physical stores by expanding its Amazon Fresh delivery service, opening brick-and-mortar stores, and launching its checkout-free Amazon Go store. AT&T Brand value: $87 bn Last year’s rank: 6 AT&T was at the heart of one of the biggest shifts in media in recent years with its $85-billion acquisition of Time Warner. The company overtook Verizon as the most valuable telecom brand. After its 2015 acquisition of DirecTV, it took a mono-brand approach and integrated the two logos, which has helped with its recognition among consumers, as per Brand Finance. Microsoft Brand value: $76.2 bn Last year’s rank: 4 With every new product release, it seems, Microsoft is increasingly trying to go against Apple’s customers. Its advertising is increasingly going after the Cupertino company and its products, like the Surface Studio computer, even look similar to a Mac. Samsung Brand value: $66.2 bn Last year’s rank: 7 Despite the scandal of the Galaxy Note 7 catching fire, the South Korean company went up one spot in the rankings. Financially, it quickly bounced back from the smartphone scandal, buoyed by stellar growth in its chip business. The company faced another scandal to start off 2017, as the group head was arrested in the midst of a corruption scandal. Verizon Brand value: $65.8 bn Last year’s rank: 5 Verizon dropped down from its fifth spot last year after signing up fewer subscribers than Wall Street analysts expected. It did, however, see its revenue grow. The company made some significant moves to set itself up for the future and grow a media division with the acquisition of Yahoo, video start-up Vessel and media company Complex. Walmart Brand value: $62.2 bn Last year’s rank: 8 Walmart beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations with revenue reaching $133 billion, driven by a 36% growth in e-commerce sales. It maintained its eighth spot on the ranking from last year. It also made a move to improve its employee welfare and started to pay them more last year. The retailer is already working on its own version of the store of the future. Facebook Brand value: $61.9 bn Last year’s rank: 17 2016 was a good year for Facebook. In April, CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined its 10-year plan, which would focus on artificial intelligence, increased connectivity around the world and virtual and augmented reality. The company’s revenue grew by 51% in 2016 and shows no sign of stopping in 2017. ICBC Brand value: $47.8 bn Last year’s rank: 13 Chinese state-owned bank ICBC is the world’s largest and also the most valuable bank in the world. This year, the bank pulled ahead of Wells Fargo to become the most valuable bank, as well as the most valuable financial brand in the Brand Finance rankings. The bank had steady financial results in 2016 with net profits growing by 1 billion yuan ($145 million). No Comments.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 102 Plus 1 on G+ 151 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares310 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Google’s fancy new AI video tool can be completely fooled Mike Wehner @MikeWehner April 4th, 2017 at 9:01 PM Share Tweet Knowing the content of any piece of media on the web is kind of Google’s bread and butter. It started with search of web pages but quickly expanded to images, where its algorithms and various tools help return image search results with greater accuracy than ever before, and now the company wants to do the same with video. To that end, Google recently debuted what it calls Cloud Video Intelligence, which is a fancy way of saying it taught machines how to identify what is in a video without having to have a human watch it and manually label it. There’s just one problem: It’s ridiculously easy to break. Don't Miss: Some of the PC’s biggest games could be coming to Nintendo’s Switch A team of researchers from University of Washington have demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that Google’s fancy content detection system is so sensitive that it can be duped into thinking a video is about one thing, when it’s really about something entirely different. After digging into how the API works, the group realized that by inserting single-frame images of a specific object at regular intervals, the system can be fooled. To prove their point, the researchers took a video of a tiger playing in a zoo and ran it through Google’s fancy tool. It produced results for Animal, Wildlife, Zoo, Nature, and Tourism, which are all perfectly handy labels and appropriately describe what’s going on. Then, they inserted a single frame image of an Audi wagon at intervals of one out of every fifty frames.   When the modified video was sent back through the tool, the results looked much different, with labels for Audi, Vehicle, Car, Motor Vehicle, and Audi A4. There wasn’t a single mention of anything animal related, despite the fact that just 1/50th of the video had images of the car, and the rest was a tiger chilling out in a pool. Google’s tool is still in its relatively early stages, and is currently in private beta. However, is problems such as this persist it could seriously limit the usefulness of the software in accurately detecting and labeling content.

Google rolling out a new look for sign-in, deprecating old methods Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:30am PDTApr 7, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 159 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares244 Development Google News Starting on April 10th Google plans on pushing out an update to the sign-in page for Google accounts. This change is meant to further unify the sign-in process across your various devices. Although the news was posted to the G Suite Developers blog, we do fully expect this change to affect all Google accounts on all browsers, mobile browsers, and iOS apps (Android apps should not be affected). Google's SSO will also see additional changes beyond the purely cosmetic, as a new permissions grant redirect will be added to the login process, and permissions requested by a site or service will be more explicitly stated. The privacy-conscious will be excited to hear that Google is making such an effort to ensure a greater awareness on the part of users when it comes to privacy and consent in the use of third party services. Unfortunately, the permission request pane will no longer list what Google considers to be "standard" permission requests, presumably including basic account information. At least Google is making some effort to increase privacy awareness during login, even going so far as to increase the burden of responsibility for that privacy on developers by requiring contact information to be listed at a link on the permissions page. These aren't the only changes to login Google will be making. The use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe after April 20th, so if you are a developer relying on a webview redirect for OAuth to grant permissions you should consider changing to the official methods very soon before it breaks. Even some large companies like Airbnb and Pocket still haven't updated to the new methods, so it's worth taking a look. The rollout for the new sign-in is expected to be quite extended, potentially requiring more than two weeks for full visibility, so don't be surprised if you don't notice any changes to your sign-in process for a while. Most people probably won't notice much of a change beyond the cosmetic, anyway (although, our readers certainly aren't most people).

Thanks. Matt I'm sure this was first hinted at during the last Google IO... or possibly earlier. Every time I had to login since hearing that announcement I lost my shit wondering what was taking so long. Josh Crumley Of all the companies out there taking our personal data and using it for profit, Google is by far the least secretive about it. I'm glad they're making the permissions more detailed. Pixelexel I don't trust any company with my data other than Google. Kanoosh i don't even really trust google , but they are the least worst imo so i i go with them. :) HSidhu Google won't give your data to anyone, your Data is their power. Kanoosh never assume just because someone tells you something , that it is true.. i still hold plenty of caution with google as should everyone else.. no tin foil hats here, just reality of things... but i do hold them in higher regard for my personal data then any others , just always good to be safe. catalysto It's not just because "someone said so". It's because if Google was ever caught actually selling/releasing user data, they'd be completely screwed. Their entire business model depends on them keeping your data private.

Summerer The 'keep me logged in' button will be removed and instead you will always stay logged in until you explicitly logout in a browser.

Rabia Atta they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Devin Rodriguez What? Indefinite Implosion they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Ryne Hager I agree, I think he was fairly clear on that point. Devin Rodriguez Oh, okay. abc But which is the fastyest? BC This is interesting and I do like the the fact that the permissions are highlighted more than they were before. This is a good thing indeed! Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe Thank god. I absolutely hate apps that do that for Google / Facebook / Twitter permission request. If the first party app is installed, popup permission request screen on those apps. Don't load a webview asking me to login with email, password, 2FA. I wish FB and Twitter will also do what Google is doing now. Drunk Squirrel Like how titanium backup opens a webview of Google sign in in order to backup to Google drive, as opposed to other apps which show up a single pop-up,, correct Ryne Hager Right? They've got libraries for that, why make me enter my information again on a device I'm already logged in on? Imagine all the time that could have been saved. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I didn't even mention "save this new browser?" screen and "logged in from a new machine" emails that those webview logins cause. I uninstall any app that uses that, no matter how good the app otherwise is. HSidhu hello @ryne Hager aka new guy :) Ryne Hager Yo! Josh Crumley Welcome to the club!

Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm.

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank.

Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

The transfer service raises the profile for Blocks and its parent company. Looker just announced $81.5 Million In Series D Funding from CapitalG, an Alphabet (Google) growth equity investment fund.  The announcement is a cherry on top of a banner year in 2016, nearly tripling revenue while adding a variety of almost 400 new customers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, The Economist, Nordstrom's, and Indiegogo.   I had the opportunity to put questions to Daniel Mintz, Looker's Chief Data Evangelist, about the impact of Google's announcement and how Looker is positioning itself among business intelligence solution providers The big news from Google Cloud Next is how Google has made it easier for companies to transfer data to BigQuery. Where does Looker Blocks fit with Google's announcement? One of the best things about Google's new BigQuery Transfer Service is that it makes data from all of Google's marketing products — including Google Analytics, DoubleClick, AdWords, and more — available in one place. Looker's Blocks for this data mean customers can start exploring the data immediately, since the Blocks provide plug-and-play data models and best-practice analysis patterns for each of these data sources. The two products combined mean data from any Google marketing product is queryable by business users in a full-fledged analysis tool suite in hours, rather than weeks. You first launched a series of Looker Blocks for Google BigQuery back in 2015. Fast forward to now: What are some lessons learned from that launch that's helped development for Google's BigQuery news? One of the things our founder, Lloyd Tabb, recognized early on with BigQuery, is that it's enormously powerful and cost-effective, so tools that bring their own analytic engines don't make a lot of sense with BigQuery. Because Looker executes SQL queries directly against the database (rather than extracting it), we're in a unique position to take full advantage of the raw processing power of BigQuery. Our native integration also means that as BigQuery improves--rolling out features like Standard SQL, user-defined functions, and compatibility with Google Sheets--Looker users immediately get all those benefits. Martech has blurred the boundaries and responsibilities between marketers, IT, and developer teams, raising discussion on who is responsible for analytics initiatives in an organization.  How has this influenced the kinds of solutions executive teams are seeking, from Looker's viewpoint and experiences? Marketing technology has come a long, long way. In the most productive organizations, everyone is using data to inform and improve their decisions. Executives recognize the competitive advantages this brings, so they're seeking solutions that allow all their users (including themselves) to find whatever data they need, whenever they need it. They want users to be able to ask and answer questions themselves, without needing to wait for IT or a data team. How has LookML — your tool for querying SQL databases — performed in attracting interest among marketers compared to other databases?   Has Looker gained developer interest in the same manner that Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have raised for their open source software?   LookML is a way to translate each business' metrics into language that their database understands — a way to give their data consistent and trustworthy meaning. Looker supports 33 different dialects of SQL, which makes it extremely attractive to marketers and developers alike, since Looker allows them to choose whatever database makes the most sense for their business. And because LookML is a code-based language, developers and analysts who already speak SQL can pick it up in a few hours. LookML makes it simple to get the knowledge about what the data means out of analysts' heads and into software that scales seamlessly. Plus, it brings flexibility, version control, and governance to SQL--all things that SQL has historically lacked.  Marketers love our approach because their analysts define the things they care about — clickthru rates, channels, attribution rules — once in Looker and then non-technical users can access all that knowledge through a point and click interface. As customers and users have built amazing things with Looker, they've fed that knowledge back to the community and we've codified some of their best practices in the Looker Blocks we've released. How has the database LookML played a role with Looker Blocks?  LookML is the language that Looker Blocks are written in. Because the new Looker Blocks are built specifically to work with BigQuery's new Data Transfer Service, we expect that all of the customers who adopt them will be using BigQuery. But most other Blocks, since they're written in LookML, are dialect agnostic and can be used with whatever database the customer is already using. Have there been surprising discoveries in how clients discuss data and make decisions while using Looker solutions? Our customers are building true data cultures where everyone gets data from a single source of truth and no one has to wait to get the data they need. What's amazing to see is that data has gone from a nice-to-have to a must-have at a lot of these companies. Everyone is expected to back up their opinions with facts and encouraged to dig in and not only ask what happened, but why and how things happened. What's most surprising is seeing how deep and wide this mentality has spread. You launched a Lookbot for Slack.  From Looker's experience with clients, what lessons in communication within organizational teams guided the development for the bot?  We know how critical good data can be for helping people make better decisions. But we also recognize that when data is hard or slow to access, business people will often just skip it. That's why we think it's so important to make data available to them right in the environments where they're working. The Lookerbot for Slack allows users to ask questions of data and get answers without ever leaving Slack. We also make it easy to embed charts and dashboards in other business tools like Salesforce and have comprehensive options for users to get data delivered to them — by email or SMS or FTP — on a schedule. By putting data right in users' existing workflows, Looker makes it much more likely that they'll use it to improve their decisions.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

Google Turns On Universal Suggest In Mobile Search Chris Dehghanpoor View All Posts 2010/04/08 9:34pm PDTApr 8, 2010 1 Plus 1 on G+ 0 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares1 News Tips & Tutorials Today Google announced universal search suggestions on the mobile version of their search page. It has been enabled on all major smartphone platforms, so even our iPhone carrying “friends” should be able to partake. Google first made this change on the desktop version of the search page back in December, and while it was neat, I can’t say I’ve really played with it since it was released. This probably has more to do with the fact that I just control+K to the search bar in Firefox or Chrome rather than visit the search page itself. If you missed the original announcement, universal suggestive search provides real time information in the drop down box that appears when you begin typing, in addition to the regular search term suggestions. The idea being that if you were to type in ‘weather houston’, it would provide you with the weather right in the box, rather than you having to go through the hassle of pressing enter, then clicking on a link from the results page (gasp!). I’ve played around with the mobile version for a bit, and I must say that it's quite helpful. Little tweaks like this make a lot of sense in the mobile browsing environment where you may already be frustrated with latency and awkward typing, and anything that can save a few clicks is valuable. While I appreciate that universal suggestive search is available in the browser, I’d really like to see Google integrate it into the Android Google search widget. I’ve been using Searchify to provide similar capabilities in Android’s built-in search, but an official solution would be a plus. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see it crop up in the near future (I’m looking at you, FroYo). In total, there are supposedly 10 keywords you can use to take advantage of this for the desktop, 7 of which I was able to use on the mobile version. You can find the complete list, with examples, and a few screenshots of my experience with the update below. Searches keywords: Unit Conversions. Example: Entering “1 oz in cups” will provide you with the conversion of 1 fluid ounce into cups Flight Tracking. Example: Entering “AA 1” will show you the latest flight stats for American Airlines flight 1 Local Time. Example: Entering “local time london” will give you the local time in London Area Codes. Example: Entering “area codes houston” will provide you with a list of area codes for that locale. In this case it seemed to fetch the results from a random dating site (though they were accurate) Calculator. Example: Entering “2*16” will provide you with the answer. Currency Conversion. Example: Entering “1 dollar to pounds” will provide you with the exchange rate for dollars to pounds. Local Weather. Example: Entering "weather houston" will show the weather in Houston, TX, along with a little weather icon Tags announcements Google mobile mobile search multi-platform search subscribe ...

That’s the key takeaway from a new report that finds Ford—yes, the Detroit-based, 113-year-old giant—is winning the race to build the self-driving car, with General Motors running a close second. Renault-Nissan, Daimler, and Volkswagen round out the top five. Meanwhile, Waymo—aka Google’s driverless car effort—sits in sixth place, with Tesla in twelfth. Uber languishes in sixteenth, behind Honda and barely ahead of startup Nutonomy and China’s Baidu. Quotes in the article General Motors Co GM ▼ 33.71 -0.45 -1.32% Baidu Inc BIDU ▼ 172.44 -0.94 -0.54% Nissan Motor Co Ltd NSANY ▼ 18.23 -0.07 -0.38% That may sound all kinds of wrong to anyone who has seen Uber, Waymo, and Tesla flaunt their tech, and regards Detroit’s old guard as ill-prepared for the robotic future. But it’s the state of the race according to Navigant Research, whose newly released “leaderboard” report ranks these players not just on their ability to make a car drive itself, but on their ability to bring that car to the mass market. “The technology is great, but unless you can build tens of thousands of cars and get people in those cars, it’s not really all that useful,” says Navigant’s Sam Abuelsamid, who wrote the report with David Alexander and Lisa Jerram. Related: Nissan’s Path to Self-Driving Cars? Humans in Call Centers The report selected the 18 biggest companies pursuing fully driverless cars, and ranked them based on nine criteria, including tech, go-to-market strategy, production prowess, staying power, and sales, marketing, and distribution. Ford and GM both score in the low to mid 80s on the technology front; it’s their old-school skills that float them to first and second place. They’ve each spent more than a century developing, testing, producing, marketing, distributing, and selling cars. Plus, each has made strategic moves to bolster weak points. Ford just dumped a billion dollars into an artificial intelligence outfit. It acquired ride-sharing service Chariot and invested in Velodyne, a company producing lidar, the laser scanning tech many argue is necessary for self-driving cars. GM scooped up self-driving expertise via a startup called Cruise, and partnered with Lyft to put the eventual result on the road.

The company plans to work with legacy automakers to put its tech in cars, but has not yet struck any major deals. “They have almost every piece of this—except the product strategy,” says Abuelsamid. Despite Uber’s high-profile self-driving pilots in Pittsburgh, Tempe, Arizona, and San Francisco, the company wallows near last place thanks to low grades for distribution, product portfolio, and staying power—and because makes Uber makes neither cars nor money. In fact, its key strength—that it already operates a global fleet of shared vehicles—may not be enough here. “It’s a lot easier for the company that actually has the infrastructure to create vehicles to recreate what Uber’s done, than the other way around,” Abuelsamid says. Tesla sits in the middle. It’s strong on “vision” (that’s Elon Musk for you) and go-to-market strategy (it’s already offering semi-autonomous cars). But Navigant knocks Tesla on staying power (it’s a young player in a brutal industry), sales, marketing, and distribution (Tesla can’t operate in every state), and technology (because Musk won’t use the expensive lidar tech experts say is necessary for full autonomy). Now, this report comes with a whopper of a caveat: These are early days in a race that will unfold over years, if not decades. Every company listed could shore up its weaknesses with smart partnerships or acquisitions, and jump to the front of the pack. Ford ranked sixth in the 2015 version of this study; Uber wasn’t on it at all. “These [results] are by no means final,” Abuelsamid says. Ranking may one day change, but they serve as a reminder that it takes more than clever tech to change the world—and that muscle still matters.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 102 Plus 1 on G+ 151 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares310 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Google ‘Fact Check’ Now Works Worldwide Haamiz Ahmed 1 day ago The menace of fake news really took center stage during the US presidential elections. Facebook and Google were at the heart of the problem and both of the companies vowed to find a solution. The social media giant started flagging fake news articles in news feed about a month ago. Now Google is doing its part by launching “Fact Check” worldwide. It uses third party fact checking sites to do see if a search query is based in truth or not. This service was started by Google in September last year and was available for Google News only. It was limited to US and UK at that time and used a claim review process to verify individual news story links. Fact Check was expanded to Brazil, Mexico and Argentina 2 months ago. Before the worldwide launch fact checking was done by Google themselves with no third parties involved. More Info on Fact Claims Now that Fact Check has launched globally, it is available for regular search results as well. A new feature added to the worldwide release is the inclusion of extra information about the fact checking process. Fact Check in action Google is relying on the fact checking websites like Snopes and PolitiFact. Justin Kosslyn, product manager at Jigsaw (known as Google Ideas earlier) said, For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page. An Explanation For Every Disputed Claim Unlike Facebook, if you see a news piece disputed by one or more fact checking sites, Google will offer a complete explanation on why it is disputed. This is because the search engine giant believes that although the claims are same, the explanation can be completely different: Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree. As we make fact checks more visible in Search results, we believe people will have an easier time reviewing and assessing these fact checks, and making their own informed opinions. Hopefully you’ll see less of “This Miracle Pill Can Make You Look 25 Years Younger!” in your news feed or search results.

Publishers now can display a Fact Check tag in news stories everywhere that Google News is available. The company also has introduced the Fact Check feature globally in Google Search, in all of the languages it supports. "For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page," noted Jigsaw Product Manager Justin Kosslyn and Research Scientist Cong Yu in an online post. "The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim," they said. How the Process Works Not all stories will be fact checked, and not all publishers will be eligible to use the Fact Check label. Those who want to have the option must use the Schema.org ClaimReview markup on the specific pages where they fact check public statements. Or, they can use the Share the Facts widget developed by the Duke University Reporters' Lab and Jigsaw. Only publishers algorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information will qualify for inclusion. The content must adhere to the following: the general policies that apply to all structured data markup; the Google News Publisher criteria for fact checks; and the standards for accuracy and transparency, readability, or proper site representation as articulated in the Google News General Guidelines. At its discretion, Google may ignore a site's markup if it fails to adhere to these policies. Alternative Facts? Although Google is enabling a system for fact checking and vetting its participants, it is not conducting any fact checking itself or assessing the validity of any fact-checked conclusions. "There may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions, Kosslyn and Yu acknowledged. "These fact checks are not Google's and are presented so people can make more informed judgements," they said. "Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it's still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree." By taking that approach, Google is avoiding responsibility for the quality, according to Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "This appears to fall under the 'we want to look like we are doing something but really don't want to fully fund the effort' category," he told TechNewsWorld. Google's Dilemma "There is no revenue upside in fact checking, and doing this right would be very costly," Enderle maintained. "However, if they don't do anything, the solution might be both legislated and very expensive, so they're focused on looking busy but minimizing the cost and exposure." Not addressing content quality might be expensive indeed. The German government is moving ahead with legislation that could result in fines of up to US$53 million imposed on social networks that don't offer users the option to complain about sites that publish hate speech and fake news, or those that refuse to remove illegal content. Google "could be acting preemptively" ahead of the German legislation, said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "You're going to see a lot of this stuff being announced or implemented to some extent by most of the social sites," he told TechNewsWorld. "Many parts of the globe are starting to get really serious about public discourse on the Internet." However, a really effective solution would prevent social sites from conducting business, Jude pointed out, "so they'll do these palliative things, whatever they can, to continue conducting business without incurring a lot of fines."

 'Significant discrimination': Government accuses Google of underpaying female workers Associated Press and Danielle Muoio Apr. 8, 2017, 1:32 PM 2,848 facebook linkedin twitter email print Adam Berry / Getty SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. The Guardian reported on the testimony of Janette Wipper, a regional director for the Labor Department. Google says it vehemently disagreed with the charges of sex discrimination, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. "The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters," said Janet Herold, regional solicitor at the Department of Labor, according to The Guardian report. "The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry," Herold continued. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. The Labor Department is suing Oracle, claiming the company pays white male employees more than counterparts with the same job title. Oracle has said the allegations are "wholly without merit."

But according to the US Department of Labor, discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry based on salary data provided by Google. Google disputes the finding and has dismissed the Department of Labor's request for more data as a "fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance". posted by clawsoon (21 comments total) 14 users marked this as a favorite   Surely this...! posted by slater at 11:05 AM on April 8 I would love to see a company handle criticism like this in a really different way. "You know what, you're right. We fucked up. For the next X months, we're going to hire 75% women." Which sounds crazy, except that's what literally every tech company does, but for men (and honestly, probably more than 75% men) posted by RustyBrooks at 11:23 AM on April 8 [8 favorites] Honestly, for an organization as large as Google, this is mostly a pipeline PR problem. If they invested more in spreading misleading memes about early childhood and STEM education and so on, it'd be much easier to dismiss the appearance of overt discrimination without any embarrassing acknowledgement of implicit or structural bias. posted by emmalemma at 11:43 AM on April 8 [8 favorites] Dear Microsoft: absolutely not. posted by ChuraChura at 11:52 AM on April 8 [5 favorites] "You know what, you're right. We fucked up. For the next X months, we're going to hire 75% women." This particular controversy is about a pay gap between men and women, not about hiring. And Google is refusing to hand documents over to the Department of Labor, which they're obligated to do as a Federal contractor. I suspect that they are hoping, probably correctly, that the Trump administration will stop pursuing cases of gender discrimination, and if they stall for long enough the problem will go away. posted by ArbitraryAndCapricious at 11:54 AM on April 8 [24 favorites] Google? Systematically suppressing the wages of a group of their employees, regardless of ethics or legality? That's ridiculous - "Apple, Google, Intel, and Adobe will shell out $415 million to put to rest an antipoaching civil lawsuit that accused the companies of conspiring not to hire each other's employees." - oh. posted by galaxy rise at 12:03 PM on April 8 [12 favorites] "You know what, you're right. We fucked up. For the next X months, we're going to hire 75% women." Right, as A&C says, that's not what this is. But also, that usually doesn't work, because the culture that only hires 25% women doesn't only show up at selection time. It's there ALL the time, developing a reputation for being a place women don't want to look for a job, subtly discouraging people with feelers out, reading resumes with an "assumed bad" attitude instead of an "assume the best" one, paying them less, treating them with less respect, and ultimately driving them away. So even your 75%-woman cohort you hire is the desperate or naive ones, and then they go away as fast as they figure it out. You have to find out WHY and fix that, not just jam more in the pipe. It's harder than it sounds on the management side and begins with "stamp out the shittiness for the ones we DO have". The pay gap is (only one, important) part of that. posted by ctmf at 12:13 PM on April 8 [6 favorites] Hired did a report recently about the Gender Wage Gap using their own data (Hired is a recruiting site for software engineers.) It's a pretty bleak read, but gives actual numbers that I think brings home what the gap looks like in practice. posted by ProtoStar at 1:06 PM on April 8 [3 favorites] I'm way too close to this to comment on the particulars but in the unlikely event that this actually gets to trial this is how I picture it going now that the current administration is in charge: Google lawyers: No, you don't understand, Google is a pure meritocracy. What you're seeing in these numbers is just that the particular men in question happen to be better, in aggregate, than the particular women in question at their jobs. That's all! We just happened to hire a crapton of really smart men, and lots of just pretty-good women! When they start making smarter women the numbers will even out. Department of Labor: Story checks out! Drop the case, fellows! Then they all go get free Google lunch. fin PROVE ME WRONG, 2017 posted by potrzebie at 2:10 PM on April 8 [12 favorites] What happens when you talk about salaries at Google [previously] posted by ryanrs at 3:21 PM on April 8 [2 favorites] As much as companies and management teams are at fault, it starts way before anyone enters the job market. It starts in grade school and just gets worse as people progress through education and into profession. There is strong cultural programming that pushes women away from STEM in addition to the hostility and idiocy exhibited by men in similar positions. As other folks have noted, it's not a pipeline issue. It's a cultural problem with our society. It is the same in gaming culture and other stereotypical, male nerd cultures. I don't know how we change things so that we raise boys into men who are not shitheads. Complex problems usually don't have simple solutions. As depressing as it is, it will probably take generations to correct these problems, assuming we get to a point where they are regarded seriously by a large enough fraction of our society. I often feel that we take one step forward, then two steps back. There is scads of data on this, and it seems like awareness is trending upward, but it is so deeply entrenched in the US that it is hard to see progress unless you are looking at multi-decade time scales. As an aside, when I worked for Google, it was a cardinal sin to discuss your salary with anyone other than your manager. I believe it was, and probably still is, a fireable offense. They really, really don't want anyone to know what anyone else is making. I have zero doubt that there is structural bias against women in compensation and several other areas in the company. It is also the case, though, that there are insane wage gaps regardless of gender. There are a lot of people making $150 - $250k who sit next to someone with the same title who makes $2.2M/year. No doubt the equity grants are smaller for women, but they were also systematically reduced for all hires every six months when I worked for the company. By virtue of starting one year earlier, an employee ten years ago might have a compensation package that is 10 - 100x that of their peers. This is one of the reasons that Google doesn't want anyone talking about comp, ever. It was also pretty common for comp to be completely static unless you were in the top .1% of performers. I worked on very big projects and won (as part of my team) both an Executive Management Award and the Google Founder's Award. My comp was static for my four+ year tenure with the company. I was granted an equity bonus for my founder's award along with several other people, but the awards varied insanely. My mentor on the team, who was female, received 1/10th the equity that I did. My PM and the lead engineer received 10x what I received. posted by drklahn at 3:49 PM on April 8 [13 favorites] Yeah, I don't believe that it's about the culture or the pipeline or any other nebulous thing that is just so unfortunate but can't be corrected by any concrete action. It's about companies choosing to pay men and women different salaries for the same roles. They can fix that if they want to, or if they're forced to by a justice department that gives a flying fuck about discrimination. As an aside, when I worked for Google, it was a cardinal sin to discuss your salary with anyone other than your manager. I believe it was, and probably still is, a fireable offense. Since April 2014, employees in the US have legally had the right to discuss their salaries. It would be illegal for a company to retaliate. posted by ArbitraryAndCapricious at 4:03 PM on April 8 [10 favorites] As an aside, when I worked for Google, it was a cardinal sin to discuss your salary with anyone other than your manager. I believe it was, and probably still is, a fireable offense. posted by drklahn at 3:49 PM on April 8 [4 favorites +] [!] It is illegal for employers to prevent employees from discussing salaries. This is a basic labor protection. Of course, companies will still try to discourage employees from discussing their pay. But if they were to fire you specifically for disclosing your salary, I imagine that would be a very easy lawsuit for the employee to win. posted by cruelfood at 4:56 PM on April 8 [4 favorites] Here is a storify of the Wired story that ryanrs linked to, in case you have an ad blocker on. posted by clawsoon at 4:58 PM on April 8 Well I guess I feel extra good now that I turned down the maternity-leave-replacement position Google offered me last summer, which (because it was through their temp agency) paid about 1/2 of the reasonable rate for my position in that area. Which is Silicon Valley. Which is FUCKING EXPENSIVE, utterly unlivable at the salary they were offering. This was not a fuck-off offer, they were working so hard to get me in that the interviewer gave me the hard sell all the way out to the parking lot. The line was "it's maternity leave replacement but so many people get hired after their temp jobs here, and hey did you see our cafeterias and the bikes we give you to get across campus and hey we have mini golf." Nope, Stepford all you like, I am not joining your cult for half what I'm worth only to be out of a job again right after the presidential inauguration... posted by Oda_a_los_calcetines at 6:13 PM on April 8 [5 favorites] "You know what, you're right. We fucked up. For the next X months, we're going to hire 75% women." Also, not to pick on RustyBrooks too much - I see this same obvious-seeming idea a lot, it just doesn't work like it seems like it should at first glance. Curiously, I NEVER see the companion idea for the pay gap: "Why not just start paying women 1.3x what men make?" Wonder why that is? posted by ctmf at 6:46 PM on April 8 [1 favorite] I'm going to say flat out that eventually this is going to come back to bite Google and Silicon Valley hard. There's a huge amount of talent that is being wasted because of this crap, abs eventually somebody is going to use that talent to do the same thing to Google that it food to its competetors. Eventually. posted by happyroach at 7:27 PM on April 8 [1 favorite] Or better yet, let's give all our female employees (past and present) back pay (plus interest) to make up for their lost wages, and pay them fairly going forwards. Of course, they could just continue on as they are until someone starts a lawsuit. They might not like the result though. posted by Secret Sparrow at 7:32 PM on April 8 [2 favorites] I cannot wait for the day that "male-dominated industries" is no longer even a thing. I am a woman in STEM, and it took me 15 years to get to the point in my career where I could demand equal pay and give the finger to companies that didn't want to pay me. To hear that Google is likely just another one of the boys' club that I've been fighting against my entire adult life makes me deeply sad to be using any Google products at all. posted by tryniti at 9:05 PM on April 8 [5 favorites] ...makes me deeply sad to be using any Google products at all. I'm with you. Fuck Google posted by BlueHorse at 9:56 PM on April 8 Hired did a report recently about the Gender Wage Gap using their own data (Hired is a recruiting site for software engineers.) Here's Google's former head of HR Laszlo Bock on the same topic: In 2015 we added 8,214 employees to Google. And the women we hired, on average, received a 30 percent bigger salary increase upon joining the company, compared to men. posted by effbot at 11:26 PM on April 8 « Older Chicago City Planning: The Graphic Novel   |   There comes John, and I must put this away.

Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done.

In this post, I’m going to use a tweet from one of my favorite influencers, Larry Kim, to illustrate all the marketing, sales, and PR possibilities we can uncover if we just keep an eye on online discussions in our industry. Ready? Grab a coffee and start listenin’. So earlier this year, Larry Kim tweeted: Apparently, he’s not alone in that opinion - the tweet got liked by almost a hundred people and sparked heated discussions about other ad platforms. Regrettably, none of the brands mentioned stepped in and joined the conversation. We don’t know if they were even listening at all, but as a marketer of a social media listening tool, I can’t help but notice all these wasted opportunities to engage. Because Larry Kim didn’t @mention Facebook or Google AdWords, they may have simply missed the tweet - a problem that they wouldn’t have if they were using a monitoring tool for their brands. . So, here are some of the things - in my humble opinion - these ad platforms could’ve and should’ve done in this situation: 1. Monitor negative feedback for reputation management Customers complain on social media because they want to be heard. They want an explanation, if not a resolution - otherwise, people would’ve just written their complaints in their diaries. Given that it’s a direct criticism on their bid management settings, Facebook could’ve at least come out and said “Sorry we’re so lame. We heard you and will try to do better.” It might be scary to face dissatisfied customers - especially on social media where your every move is under public scrutiny - but not responding makes customers feel like you don’t care. And they'll stop caring too. And nothing kills a business faster than apathy. Of course, you can’t respond to negative feedback if you don’t even know its happening, so the first thing you need to do is to set up alerts for your brand, so that you’ll be notified of any such discussions even when people aren’t tagging you. Pro tip: Set up alerts for your product name and keywords like “issues,” “troubles,” or “problems.” If you’re overwhelmed with mentions, filter them by sentiment. Focus on frustrated customers first. 2. Monitor customer feedback for product improvement Saying sorry is the first step, but real improvements must follow your apology. After putting out the fire and saving face, Facebook should take a deep dive into their bid management settings or interface and actually try to resolve the issue. In this case, for example, Facebook can start by collecting feedback and ideas for improvement from this comment thread: They can then make a tally for the most requested feature to guide their product development roadmap. Customers know what they want and need, so the more you take your customers’ opinions into consideration, the higher chance of success you’ll have for your product. Tracking what features your customers like about your competitors is also a great way to get ideas - so Facebook could also look into how Google AdWords is rocking people’s socks off, for example, and steal a couple of tricks from them. Pro tip: Set up alerts for your product name and keywords like “if only” “I wish” or “please improve,” or your product and feature names. Like “‘Apple’ and ‘Siri’” or “‘Apple’ and ‘3D touch’.” You can then do the same for your competitors. 3. Monitor your competitors for opportunities to out-win them If you’ve paid close enough attention, you’ll see that Facebook isn’t the only brand mentioned here. Google AdWords, a competitor of Facebook’s ad platform, is praised in this tweet. If they had set up alerts for their brand, Google could’ve jumped in and grabbed this perfect opportunity to gloat. First, they could thank Larry Kim for the shoutout and then retweet it to their community. If they want to take it one step further, they could even create campaigns that joke about the drawbacks of Facebook’s interface - which is something that smartphone brands love doing: Obviously, you can’t beat the competition if you don’t know what they’re doing, so don’t just monitor discussions about your own brand, but also those of your competitors. Listen to what your customers think about your competitors, and look out for golden PR opportunities you can leverage. 4. Monitor your industry for lead generation Responding when your brand is mentioned should be an obvious given, but savvy social media marketers or sales reps should listen and hunt for opportunities to speak up, even when they aren’t the focus. In this example, Facebook partners and third party ad platforms could jump in a say “we can help” Because monitoring non-direct competitors or industry leaders is not only a great way to stay on top of trends, but also to generate leads. If you’re a PPC agency, for example, you could monitor discussions about people having trouble with setting up their own AdWords account, or difficulty with Google’s keyword planner, and offer advice and help. That way, even if you don’t score the client right away, you’ll win PR points, and establish your brand on social media, which will likely mean more money in the long run. 5. Monitor discussions to find VIPs for Influencer marketing One of the reasons I picked this tweet for this case study is because Larry Kim isn’t just any ordinary Twitter user. As the founder of Wordstream, and with 648K Twitter followers, Larry is a huge influencer in the B2B tech industry. His opinion carries weight. In the social media world, all tweets are equal, but some tweets are more equal than others, so it’s a huge mistake for Facebook to ignore this tweet, and for Google AdWords to not leverage this influencer marketing opportunity. If you’re using a monitoring tool like Mention, you’ll not only be notified when someone mentions your brand, but you can also filter the mentions by their influencer score to prioritize the VIPs. And when you want to launch an influencer marketing campaign, you can easily find big guns who’ve already talked about you or your industry (depending on what keywords you’re monitoring) and reach out to them. Everybody’s on social media, but most aren’t using it right So by now, you should see all the opportunities you’ll miss if you don’t monitor social media in real time. Most companies are on social media with elaborate social media plans and posting schedules, but you can’t get the most out of social media if you don’t know when people are talking about you and engage with them.

Now, the agency claims that it has found “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.” During a court hearing for the case on Friday, DoL Regional Director Janette Wipper explained that the agency determined that the tech giant pays its female employees less than their male counterparts, according to The Guardian. In a statement to the paper, DoL Regional Solicitor Janet Herold confirmed the statement, noting that while the agency was still investigating, it has “received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” “significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters” Google denied these allegations, staying in a statement that it “vehemently disagree[s] with [Wipper’s] claim,” and that the company has found no evidence of a pay gap during its annual analysis. It claimed that this was the first time it had heard of these allegations, and that the DoL hasn’t provided the company with information about its methodology or data to support them. In a Tweet posted earlier this week, the company said that it has closed the wage gap between genders globally. The initial lawsuit was initiated when the company didn’t turn over some requested data on employee compensation during a September 2015 audit. According to Google, that information was withheld for privacy reasons, saying that the request by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) was “overly broad”. The company refused to turn this information over, and the DoL has taken it to court to compel it to do so. The OFCCPT ensures that businesses which take federal contracts comply with federal law. In particular, any contractor that does more than $10,000 in business with the government for a year is subject to equal employment opportunity regulations, which specifically prohibit contractors from “discriminating in employment decisions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.” Google claimed that the Department of Labor’s request was overly broad, and unduly burdensome In February, the OFCCP asked for a summary judgement on the matter, which a judge denied. Despite that setback, the DoL is pressing on. On Friday, the DoL issued a pre-hearing statement, in which it spelled out its case asking the court to compel Google to turn over the information it required to the OFCCP. While neither side disagrees that the tech firm is subject to these regulations, the statement explains that the DoL and Google disagree over a couple of facts: first, that the information including employee names and contact information are relevant to the audit, and that the company faces an “undue burden” by producing this data. The DoL outlined that Google isn’t burdened by its request, nor is complying interrupting its business. The agency pointed to Google’s own policies and internal Affirmative Action Plan, saying that “Google created much of the burden about which it now complains,” as well as the fact that it’s devoted $150 million to address diversity issues. The agency also noted that the amount of business that Google does with the federal government is irrelevant when it comes with compliance with the federal order: more business doesn’t mean that the bar for an audit is raised. Furthermore, the OFCCP says that it had offered to bear the cost of compiling the information.

Following a notice that users have seen in recent days, the list functionality will be moved into Google Home and Express to better integrate with the former device’s ordering and delivery feature. Nintendo Switch Heading to the Google Assistant-made shopping list in Keep will bring up a message advising them of the change. The official support page notes that previously saved items will automatically show up in a new primary Google Shopping List. While this change is mandatory, users who do not want current items added to that list are advised to make a copy and then delete the original Keep shopping list. After April 10th, your new shopping list will be accessible by tapping the list icon in Express and Home, or the current shortcut in Assistant settings. Additionally, items added via Assistant will only be visible there. Sharing will still be possible, with current list viewers automatically CC’ed to the newly created list in those two new apps. The catalyst for this change is likely closer integration with Home’s new shopping and ordering feature. Since launch in February, the Google Express shopping list has been independent from Keep’s, likely adding to user confusion over why items added with Assistant do not show up. Of course, for those who do not use Express, like Keep, or don’t have a Home, this change might be frustrating as seamlessly adding items to lists was a convenient Assistant feature.

It's been another thrilling week across the tech world, with no end of exciting announcements, spicy rumors... and some disappointments. As ever, 7 Days is here to bring you up to speed with what's been happening with a handy walkthrough of the week's top tech news. Our journey begins this week with Microsoft, which is preparing to host its a 'virtual career fair' building on its Autism Hiring Program. The event coincides with National Autism Awareness Month in the United States, and aims to provide new opportunities for talented individuals with autism. The latest in WikiLeaks' Vault7 series of releases revealed details of 'Marble', a framework used by the CIA to mask the source of the malware it used to target devices, in an effort to avoid detection by forensic investigators. Meanwhile, a security researcher examined Samsung's Tizen operating system, used in its smart TVs, smartwatches, and other devices. The researcher declared the OS a security disaster, and said it "may be the worst code I've ever seen". The European Aviation Safety Agency raised serious concerns about passenger safety following the recent ban - on some flights to and from the US and UK - of many electronic devices from the main passenger cabin. Verizon is preparing to install an app on its mobile devices that will monitor user data in order to target ads at its customers. Predictably, that news hasn't gone down well with many people - in fact, the Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized Verizon for loading its phones with "spyware". Verizon is pushing ahead with its Yahoo acquisition, and announced this week that it will merge that company with AOL into a new division branded - hilariously, and inexplicably - as 'Oath'. A branding expert at the highly regarded Brand New site described the name as "completely ridiculous, pretentious, annoying, and, above all, irrelevant to anything having to do with digital media." Can't argue with that. Mozilla is planning to introduce a new user interface with the upcoming release of Firefox 57, along with several new features for the browser. WhatsApp is reportedly in talks to integrate its communication service with a mobile payment platform. Apple released iOS 10.3.1 on Monday, bringing an important security update to fix a vulnerability that could allow someone to execute code on the Wi-Fi chip. Apple dumped its hardware partner Imagination Technologies, as it now plans to develop its own graphics processor technology for future mobile devices. That move had a devastating effect on the British company, wiping over 60% off its stock price. After three and a half years without an update, Apple apologized this week for having done nothing to improve its Mac Pro desktop PCs, and promised that a new model is on the way - but it won't be coming anytime soon. It finally made some spec changes to the existing Mac Pro line, along with some pricing adjustments on Tuesday, and said that it will launch an 'iMac Pro' later this year - but no, it won't have a touchscreen. Apple is also said to be rethinking its approach to TV, and may be planning to sell bundles of pay-TV services such as HBO, Showtime and Starz. Google launched its new YouTube TV service in six US markets this week, with 39 TV stations and at least ten more on the way. The service will be priced at $35 per month. A beta version of YouTube Go - which allows users to watch and share videos offline - also appeared on the Google Play Store. Google published its latest breakdown of Android version usage this week, showing no growth at all for Android 7.1 Nougat, the latest version of the OS. Android 6.0 Marshmallow saw a slight decline in usage, but the ageing 5.x Lollipop remains the most widely used version. The long, slow rollout of Nougat continues, reaching more devices in recent days: Android 7.0 rollout begins for Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 and 9.7 Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ get Nougat on Sprint Android 7.1.2 images now available; Nexus 6 and 9 are no longer supported Google Pixel and Pixel XL on Verizon get their own version of Android 7.1.2 The poor state of Android updates was clearly demonstrated this week, as several devices were finally upgraded to Android 6.0 Marshmallow, eighteen months after that version was released: Better late than never: Oppo R9, R9 Plus and F1s finally get Marshmallow update Fairphone 2 gets Android 6.0 update YotaPhone 2 gets Marshmallow; YotaPhone 3 teaser appears A handful of Samsung's devices also received the March security update, over four weeks after those patches were made available by Google: Galaxy A5 (2017) in Europe Galaxy A5 (2016) in Europe Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on Sprint We knew it was coming, but Google finally killed its Map Maker tool last weekend, promising to integrate its features into the core Google Maps product. Google also delivered an update to its Daydream virtual reality platform, adding a minor, but useful feature. Unfortunately, it also emerged that Samsung's new Galaxy S8 and S8+ aren't compatible with Daydream, and given that Samsung is promoting its own separate Gear VR suite, it's not yet clear if that compatibility will ever come. Samsung launched a new version of its Galaxy S8+ in its home market of South Korea, featuring 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage, rather than the 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage on the standard model. Samsung has been promising to launch devices with foldable displays for years now. Recent rumors had even suggested that it would release one such device before the end of 2017. But the company made it clear this week that the technology isn't yet 'mature', and the first foldable devices won't arrive until at least 2019. In November 2016, OnePlus said that it would fix a touch input lag issue on its flagship 3 and 3T devices, but said that it wasn't the company's top priority. At the time, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei told customers complaining about the issue to "keep things in perspective". Over four months later, OnePlus has finally fixed the problem - although the fix isn't yet available to owners of those devices. OnePlus said in November that its top priority was working on its Android 7.0 Nougat update, which it released for the 3 and 3T in January. But owners of the OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X have been told nothing about its plans to deliver Nougat for their devices - and they're becoming increasingly frustrated with the company about that. More details were revealed this week about HTC's new flagship (yep, another one), which is expected to be released as the 'HTC U'. Sony's new "super mid-range" Xperia XZs went on sale on Wednesday, priced at $699. Its key feature - which it shares with the range-topping Xperia XZ Premium - is its rear camera, which can record super-slow-motion video at a whopping 960 frames per second. HMD Global still hasn't announced exact release dates, but it's looking increasingly likely that its new Nokia 3310 will go on sale in April, with the Nokia 3, 5, and 6 launching internationally throughout May. According to the latest data from StatCounter, Android has officially passed Windows as the most widely used operating system for internet usage - a major milestone for Google's OS. Meanwhile, Windows 10 has been making good progress among gamers, reaching its highest ever usage share on the Steam gaming platform, now at 51.2%. On Wednesday, Microsoft officially released the Windows 10 Creators Update, although its general rollout won't begin until April 11. For now, those wishing to install it can do so using the Media Creation Tool, or via Microsoft's Update Assistant. Microsoft has advised those on the Windows Insider Program to check and adjust their settings, as it said that the next wave of new Fast ring builds from the Development Branch are likely to include many bugs and instabilities. The first cumulative update for the Creators Update, build 15063.13, has already been released to the Production ring, for those who have installed the newest version of the OS. Coinciding with availability of the Creators Update, Microsoft also launched the 'final' - i.e. non-preview - version of the Software Development Kit (SDK) for that release. There are a couple of issues that some users will need to be aware of, though. For example, Apple's Boot Camp doesn't yet support clean installations of the Windows 10 Creators Update on its Mac devices. And some users have reported problems with the Logitech BRIO webcam after installing the Creators Update - but there is a fix available. Microsoft updated its hardware requirements for Windows 10 as part of its Creators Update refresh, including those for mobile devices. However, there's still no support for Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 and 835 chips, so any company wishing to build a Windows handset remains limited to using older processors. You can see the full list of changes to the Windows 10 Mobile hardware requirements here. But a far greater disappointment for Windows 10 Mobile users is that the Creators Update won't be coming to all currently-supported handsets. Devices such as the Lumia 735, 830, 930 and 1520 will apparently be unable to get an official upgrade to the new version. As you can probably imagine, that revelation - which hasn't yet been explicitly confirmed by Microsoft - resulted in a wave of anger towards the company from owners of those soon-to-be-unsupported handsets. One handset that is on the list of supported devices is HP's Elite x3. Last month, Microsoft slashed 25% off the cost of the Windows 10 Mobile flagship, and its Desk Dock accessory, reducing the bundle's price from $799 to $599 in the US. That offer was due to end on March 31, but Microsoft has extended it for another month. Over in the UK, Microsoft is offering huge discounts of up to 22% off its Surface Book devices. This latest deal - and good grief, there have been a lot of them lately - is due to last for two months. Microsoft released new firmware for its Surface Book and Pro 4 on Thursday - but it's only available for those who have upgraded their devices to the Windows 10 Creators Update. The first details were revealed about Microsoft's new Surface Pro 5 - but if you were hoping for a major redesign of the device, you'll be disappointed. The new version is described as "nothing dramatic" in comparison with its predecessor, and is expected to include only a few minor upgrades to bring its specs up to date. Microsoft beat Apple in the JD Power 2017 US Tablet Satisfaction Study for the first time. The study found that Microsoft's Surface tablets came top for design, accessories, the range of ports on its devices, the storage options available, and more. JD Power said that Microsoft Surface "sets the bar for customer satisfaction". Microsoft is working on 'Project Sopris', an effort to improve security among the growing number of low-cost internet-connected devices. The company has also confirmed that Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 support will be required for Windows 10 IoT Core devices in a future update. Microsoft opened up about the types of data that it collects from Windows 10 devices, revealing a much greater level of detail than ever before on the telemetry that it harvest from users' systems. Its commitment to greater transparency comes alongside new user-facing privacy controls introduced in the Creators Update. With the Creators Update - developed under the codename 'Redstone 2' - now reaching Production status, Microsoft is already pushing ahead with development of its next major update. The company released its first Redstone 3 Insider Preview, build 16170, for PCs in the Fast ring on Friday. Given Microsoft's earlier warnings about potential instability in early RS3 builds, make sure you read the release notes before deciding whether or not to install it! Microsoft is focusing on 'structural' improvements to OneCore in its early RS3 builds, but we're already learning more about its plans to improve the look and feel of Windows 10 in its next update, with a refreshed design language developed under the codename 'Project NEON'. For example, one change coming to the PC Start menu will be the introduction of transparent Live Tiles. New animations will also be part of the updated user experience in Windows 10, as these Redstone 3 concept images show. Elements of Project NEON have already started creeping into the OS through updates to some of Microsoft's Windows 10 apps. After a similar update to its Groove Music app last month, the Movies & TV app also received a minor update for Insiders in line with the new design ideas. Over nine months after its iOS beta was released, and nearly eight months behind the Android beta, Microsoft finally released the first preview of its Flow business app for Windows phones on Monday. Unfortunately, popular music streaming service Spotify announced that it will no longer add any new features to its app for Windows phones, which has now been placed in "maintenance mode". And there was more disappointment for Windows phone owners, as EA also revealed that The Sims Freeplay will get no more updates on those devices. Netflix introduced its Download & Go feature - which lets users save videos to watch offline - to iOS and Android last year. On Monday, it finally added that feature to its Windows 10 app. Messaging app Telegram also made its way to the Windows Store for PCs. Microsoft made some improvements to the Windows Store for Insiders, including a new progress bar design, and a revised share button. Another feature that it added to the Store is the ability to install an app on the Xbox One from a PC. However, it also made a change to its store policies, explicitly banning all game emulators from the Windows Store and its Xbox One consoles. But perhaps the most exciting news of the week was the revelation of key details about Project Scorpio, which Microsoft describes as "the most powerful console ever". The mighty machine will have eight custom x86 cores, a custom-designed GPU, 12GB of GDDR5 RAM with 326GB/s bandwidth, and more - all adding up to some serious gaming power. Microsoft's Mike Ybarra said that Scorpio isn't just about making superlative gaming hardware; it's also a clear demonstration that the company is doing everything it can to "win the developers back". There's still a lot we don't know about Scorpio, and it won't actually be released until much later in the year. But in the meantime, Microsoft is continuing development of updates for its existing Xbox range. Following the release of the Creators Update (Version 1703) for the Xbox One last month, Xbox Insider Preview build 15063.2013 (Version 1704) made its way to those in the Alpha ring on Thursday, while those in Preview Ring 3 also got their first taste of Version 1704 this week. There were just two additions to the list of Xbox 360 games playable on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility Program. We Happy Few - an eerie survival game set in a drug-fuelled, alternate version of 1960s England - is being made into a movie. The game is currently available in preview form on the Xbox One and PCs. Mass Effect: Andromeda, which was released on the Xbox One, PS4 and PC last month, is getting a big update. The new update, which rolled out on Thursday, brings animation improvements, additional romance options, and more. Numerous owners of the new Nintendo Switch have said that their consoles are 'warping', particularly when being used in docked mode. One publication reported seeing the same issue on one of their consoles. AMD released its latest Crimson ReLive driver, 17.4.1, adding better support for Oculus Rift's ASW and Steam VR's SVRAR virtual reality APIs. However, this is only for a particular set of graphics cards. Nvidia delivered its latest GeForce Game Ready 381.65 WHQL drivers, adding support for the Windows 10 Creators Update. But our journey across the tech world ends this week, with Nvidia's monstrous new GTX TITAN Xp, which the company describes as "the world's most powerful graphics card", featuring 12GB of GDDR5X memory, and boasting a beastly 12 teraflops of power. Want! Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Michael Firth celebrated the 25th birthday of Windows 3.1, which, frankly, made some of us feel a bit older than we'd have liked! Nonetheless, it was a great excuse to eat some cake. Rich Woods got his hands on HP's stylish new Spectre x360 2-in-1, which has a 4K display and Pen support. Check out the unboxing video for his first impressions of the device. And Rich also got his paws on HP's EliteBook x360 G2, a business-class Windows 10 2-in-1 with some pretty solid specs and handy features. His unboxing video and first impressions can be found here. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares170 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu has led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? thespacecowboy Network ads are only on shows you've recorded yourself. Google ads are on the on-demand stuff, Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks. Carson Saldanha ?` Shawn Spring I'm hoping this and Nick Jr (for the kiddos) comes sooner rather than later! freshprince_87 I hope they add it soon Lateef Alabi-Oki I think the nailed the user interface.

Tucker Sferro $35 is outrageous. You might as well jest get cable. Jacob Fulbright After you add in YouTube Red, Netflix, Hulu (or the ad-free premium Hulu), HBO GO, etc., yeah, cable isn't looking so bad anymore. Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either Naxx ENVY 1) some services don't allow you to share with other people and is considered a breach of contract 2) i get what he's saying, we have to have 5-6 differernt contracts to watch shows when cable covers it all not sure i like how its all going tbh, its going to end up being more expensive to have the same channels. .. just the illusion of choice BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings abc Cable eats up your data cap? Lateef Alabi-Oki I don't have a data cap. Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af Brandon Giesing My family switched from AT&T to Charter Spectrum (before the whole Spectrum branding became a thing) because AT&T had around a 150 GB per month cap and once you hit that you had to pay like $20 extra to add 40 more GB. With 4 people constantly streaming music and video, downloading apps and Linux distros, and much more; we not only hit that every month but had to pay the extra $20 3-5 times every month. Our bills was like $300+ a month (Internet and Phone, not counting the separate expensive TV bill which was either DirecTV or DISH) Geoff Johnson Be glad you don't have Comcast, they have a 1TB cap. Malachi Jones Damn, here in the UK we have some providers offering £14.99/month internet only deals, super cheap in comparison to $99/month! Geoff Johnson What's the speed at 14.99/mo? thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. thespacecowboy The mobile access is huge. I think the other suppliers limit what you can watch on mobile, whereas with YouTube it's baked right in to the product offering. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Shawn Medeiros Get a HDTV antenna. You can get those right over the air free in much of the us. thespacecowboy Yeah. We did this about 18 months ago and use a Tivo OTA with lifetime service. Shame there are not more OTA channels. I'm going to attempt cable card but its not easy (the bracket is there but not the full thing which has to be bought separately). Geoff Johnson Do you have any idea how much cable TV actually costs? Tucker Sferro yes - after cutting the cord I receive about 1 letter per week from Fios begging me to come back, with basic packages starting around $29/mo. Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader Bruce Wayne Calm down. Android TV will come in due time. It's a new service. It's not even available nationwide yet. Midnitte Hopefully it exists once it launches nationally, but it's really silly they dont yet have an Android *TV* app for their *TV* service. Zachary Dunn Android TV should be a key feature of their TV offering. Not having it at launch is ridiculous. Not to mention, Youtube Gaming has been out for over a year and still doesn't have Android TV support, which is odd since Android TV is a platform built for streaming and gaming. Play Music on Android TV hasn't received any features released in the last year. Everytime Google releases a tv app without Android TV support, ppl say just wait for it, but it never happens or is half assed. KChristainsen you would think this is a no brainier to have an app for ATV. Just ridiculous. YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. thespacecowboy If you like that, check out George Clark's Amazing Spaces. It's on UK Channel 4 but likely available elsewhere. http://www.channel4.com/programmes/george-clarkes-amazing-spaces cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature thespacecowboy Only on things you recorded yourself, not on demand. Geoff Johnson Hulu doesn't have live TV. tim242 We were not talking about live TV. AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. DirkBelig Well that blows. Ramon Very. The only one that came close to this support is DirectTV Now. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. Geoff Johnson Then stream the 1080p version John Doe Hi, have you meet Netflix? Also, there is the choice I am not saying Google should force everyone's stream to the highest resolution (They don't even do that now, there is auto select). FYI, HDR has nothing to do with 4K and it actually does not add much to a the bandwidth requirement (Netflix said it adds 2.5MB/s compared to 12MB/s for 4K) Lars Jeppesen Do the channels even broadcast in 1080p or 4K? Box Most slim bundles and IPTV setups are only available in 720p at this time. YouTube TV is not alone in this. John Doe Most do in 1080i and I only have one 4K channel through Dish Network. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! PhantomGamers For sure you'll only get the channels that Google has agreements with, I doubt they're just grabbing up every OTA signal and streaming that. thespacecowboy It's going to depend on market. But I have many PBS on my Tivo, but none on my Youtube TV. Any device that has Chromecast should work. Some at the moment don't seem to work though (such as some Vizio TVs). After you pay for your 2nd month (after trial) they will send you a free Chromecast anyway. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. hp-fourtwenty no, you have the option to record all games of any team you select, which also adds it as a recommendation when you log in. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. Lars Jeppesen No hp-fourtwenty 50 live channels, and this is the first time I've been able to watch a New York Rangers game online without needing a traditional cable package or watching a pirated stream. I'm happy to pay only $35...especially since I already pay $10 for GPMAA/red thespacecowboy Isn't GPMAA on top of the $35? hp-fourtwenty yup, plus yt red exclusive programming...just no ad free yt red....and strangely no yttv background playback DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams. Acquire more channels. Lars Jeppesen People still watch MTV? Geoff Johnson Of course... Dirty Dave http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_youtube-tv2-768x432.jpg Im in the UK so this article is pointless for me, but what keyboard is this though Ryan? Ryan Definitely interesting. Ill hold off until college ball is back on, I only really care about OTA and ESPNs, so they have that advantage. sloheim "For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord" Wrong, wrong, for the love of god, WRONG. No NHL Network, NFL Network, or MLB Network or NBA TV. Anti-sports. Box Does the "three active streams" restriction include on-demand and recordings? Ben Nicholls Not too interested unless the provide more package options, or a la carte packages. Part of the reason I cut the cord was to stop paying for channels I don't watch. I would like to see at minimum a "no sports" package. ESPN is one of the most expensive channels and I don't like paying for it in a package when I don't watch it. An AndroidTV app is also a must. BinaryTB Google's Family Group system? Sounds like it won't support Google Apps for Work for people that actually pay Google already for their own domain. Add it to the list: Google Fi Google Play Music Family Plan Google Play Apps Family Sharing DirkBelig >"There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo." And what's preventing anyone from simply subscribing to HBO NOW or bundling Showtime or Starz for $9 with their Amazon Prime package? Anyone who would get this probably has a Netflix account and app, so I don't understand what the beef is here having to a la carte HBO other than it breaks the cable channel grid paradigm. #FirstWorldProblems thespacecowboy +ing a show also adds any on-demand shows to your library. Downside is those ones have ads, like Hulu. TV guide is frustrating. You can't easily see past the current show and the next one. EPG is weird. You can click on the channel name and then browse that actual channel, but not in a grid style. hp-fourtwenty Yes, we need a good epg severely!! Lex Lybrand It's not available on Android TV. That's a day-1 must-have. Sean McGeezer I'll wait for Cartoon Network at the very least, though it may not happen Terry Sanchez It does not have the Cooking channel and is lacking many channels. I hope this improves over time. SlingTV is still better right now. JG Is it steam only? Or can one pin content to their devices for local/offline play? Then I could​ save a recording or two to watch on my (non-driving) commute without having to worry about adding to much to my monthly bill at $10/gig. Or maybe save something for longer than the 9 month period. Google's Play Movie/TV app allows it, as does the new light weight version of YouTube being beta'd in India now. Netflix and Showtime do to... I would assume if they can do it, why not also YouTube TV? thespacecowboy No download option at the moment.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 102 Plus 1 on G+ 151 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares310 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !fe112c: On monday I got a great new mclaren f1 from having earned $12778 this last four weeks.. 3 to 5 hours of work a day... Weekly paychecks... Bonus opportunities...Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Name: Subject: Message: Google clamps down on fake news, brings Fact Check to Search globally Newsby Kris Carlon13 hours ago 22 524 55 It’s gotten to the point where you can’t believe anything on the internet anymore (does that apply to this statement?), with more unfounded claims being made every day and disseminated around the globe at fiber optic speeds. As we’ve seen a lot lately from major online presences like Facebook and Google, the crackdown against fake news is intensifying. The latest effort sees the search giant now bringing its Fact Check service to search globally to help you sort the facts from the bluster. See also: Google and Facebook make moves to stop circulation of fake news November 15, 2016 Originally announced back in October of last year, Fact Check was initially designed for publishers in a few countries to append verifications of claims made in Google News stories. But Google has evidently felt a need to roll it out more broadly, announcing Friday that Fact Check will now appear around the globe, in both Google News and Search. Now, when you search for something on Google, if there’s any contentious claims contained therein that have been fact checked by the likes of Snopes or Politico, for example, you’ll see the status of the claim’s basis in fact. Of course, you won’t see Fact Check on every result and if different fact checking sites have drawn different conclusions regarding the same claim you might even come across conflicting fact check information. While this is obviously not a perfect system, Google points out that “we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.” The Fact Check data does not come from Google and publishers need to opt in to the service.

Mary Pickford Google doodle marks 125th birthday of the ‘Queen of Movies’ A celebrated actress, director, and producer during the silent film era, Pickford remains one of the most powerful women ever to work in Hollywood. Amy Gesenhues on April 8, 2017 at 10:00 am More Today’s Google doodle honors film star Mary Pickford on what would have been the actress’ 125th birthday. While best known as a leading actress during the silent film era, Pickford was also a director and producer. She co-founded the United Artists film studio, and was an original member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Her long list of accomplishments earned her the title “Queen of the Movies.” From the Google doodle blog: She appeared in as many as 50 films per year, and eventually negotiated wages that were equal to half of each of her films’ profits. She went on to demand full creative and financial control of her films, a feat still unheard of to this day. In addition to her work in film, Google says Pickford sold Liberty Bonds during World War I. She used her connections to create the Motion Picture Relief Fund and is credited with revolutionizing the film industry by creating options for independent film producers to distribute their films outside of the studio system. The artwork for today’s Mary Pickford doodle borrows from one of the most iconic images of the actress with a cat perched on her shoulder. The doodle leads to a search for “Mary Pickford” and includes a sharing icon. After winning a Best Actress Academy Award for her role as Coquette in 1929, Pickford was given an honorary Academy Award for lifetime Achievement in 1976.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Apr 09, 2017 - Page 15　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Cloud computing makes powerful AI available to all By Dina Bass and Mark Bergen  /  Bloomberg In October last year, Deschutes Brewery Inc’s Brian Faivre was fermenting a batch of Obsidian Stout in a massive tank. Something was amiss; the beer was not fermenting at the usual temperature. Luckily, a software system triggered a warning and he fixed the problem. “We would have had to dump an entire batch,” the brewmaster said. The software that spotted the temperature anomaly is from Microsoft Corp and it is a new type that uses a powerful form of artificial intelligence (AI) called machine learning. What makes it potentially revolutionary is that Deschutes rented the tool over the Internet from Microsoft’s cloud-computing service. Day to day, Deschutes uses the system to decide when to stop one part of the brewing process and begin another, saving time while producing better beer, the company says. The Bend, Oregon-based brewer is among a growing number of enterprises using new combinations of AI tools and cloud services from Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google. C-SPAN is using Amazon image-recognition to automatically identify who is in the government TV programs it broadcasts. Insurance company USAA is planning to use similar technology from Google to assess damage from car accidents and floods without sending in human insurance adjusters. The American Heart Association is using Amazon voice recognition to power a chat bot registering people for a charity walk in June. AI software used to require thousands of processors and lots of power, so only the largest technology companies and research universities could afford to use it. An early Google system cost more than US$1 million and used about 1,000 computers. Deschutes has no time for such technical feats. It invests mostly in brewing tanks, not data centers. Only when Microsoft, Amazon and Google began offering AI software over the Internet did these ideas seem plausible. Amazon is the public cloud leader, but each company has its strengths. Democratizing access to powerful AI software is the latest battleground and could decide which tech giant emerges as the ultimate winner in a cloud infrastructure market worth US$25 billion this year, according to researcher IDC. “There’s a new generation of applications that require a lot more intense data science and machine learning. There is a race for who is going to provide the tools for that,” said Diego Oppenheimer, chief executive officer of Algorithmia Inc, a start-up that runs a marketplace for algorithms that do some of the same things as Microsoft, Amazon and Google’s technology. If the tools become widespread, they could transform work as more automation lets companies get more done with the same human workforce. C-SPAN, which runs three TV stations and five Web channels, previously used a combination of closed-caption transcripts and staff to determine when a new speaker started talking and who it was. It was so time-consuming that the network only tagged about half of the events it broadcast. The network began toying with Amazon’s image-recognition cloud service the same day it launched, archive technical manager Alan Cloutier said. Now it is using it to match all speakers against a database it maintains of 99,000 US government officials. IDC expects spending on such cognitive systems and AI to grow 55 percent a year for the next five years. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1877 times. Comments will be moderated.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Apr 09, 2017 - Page 16　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp US accuses Google of discrimination AP, SAN FRANCISCO US government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees have accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A US Department of Labor official disclosed the agency’s allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Labor Department regional director Janette Wipper testified, according to a report published by the Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it had not heard until Wipper’s court appearance. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” Google said in its statement. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 percent of Google’s technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google’s more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labor Department’s probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the US government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers’ privacy. The technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle Corp, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software How to Root and Update Google Pixel and Pixel XL to Android 7.1.2 N2G47E Official By Rafia Shaikh Apr 5, 2017 16Shares Share Tweet Submit Along with the monthly security updates, Google also published Android 7.1.2 for its Pixel and Nexus lineup this week. The update brings improvements and fixes to Bluetooth connectivity and battery life, among other minor bug fixes. While you would be able to upgrade it via OTA, you can also update Google Pixel to Android 7.1.2 using factory images. Prerequisites to update Google Pixel to Android 7.1.2 Create a backup of all important data on your Pixel device. Download and install USB drivers for Pixel on your computer. Unlock Pixel bootloader. The Android SDK should be installed on your PC with ADB and Fastboot command working. Enable USB debugging option by pressing Menu > Settings > Applications. Navigate and tap on Developer Options to enable USB Debugging. Ensure that your Pixel phone carries more than 70% of charge. Steps to update Google Pixel to Android 7.1.2 N2G47E Required files: Download factory images for your Pixel or Pixel XL from the links shared below: Related Nexus 5X Gets Pixel’s ‘Swipe For Notifications’ Fingerprint Gesture With Android 7.1.2 Pixel Android 7.1.2 – Download Factory Image Pixel XL Android 7.1.2 – Download Factory Images Follow these steps now to update Google Pixel to Android 7.1.2 N2G47E. Connect your device using a USB cable and turn it off. Make sure that Fastboot is installed on your PC. Now, start the device in Fastboot mode: Turn on the phone while pressing and holding the Volume Up + Volume Down + Power keys until you see the Fastboot menu and the START text on top. Extract the downloaded Android 7.1.2 file on your PC. Go to _N2G47E_ folder and copy/paste all the files to your Fastboot directory (which often is the platform-tools folder inside the Android SDK directory). This step involves flashing the factory image to your Pixel device. Open the Fastboot folder where we just copied our Nougat factory files. In the address bar, type cmd and type the command written below and press enter. On Windows: Run flash-all.bat On Mac: Run flash-all.sh using Terminal Linux: Run flash-all.sh Once the script finishes running, your Pixel will reboot. First boot may take up to 5 minutes, so don’t worry if it takes your device longer than usual to boot up. Root N2G47E Android 7.1.2 official firmware on Google Pixel & XL Required files: Download Android SDK and install it. Set it up with platform-tools and USB drivers package in SDK. Download SuperSU v2.78 SR5 for your Pixel device on your PC. Download TWRP recovery tool (zip) (for Pixel and Pixel XL) and store the ZIP file in the root directory of your phone. Also, download Fastboot from the following links, depending on your OS and extract it in android-sdk-windows\platform-tools directory. Create the directory if not already there. Windows: Download Mac: Download Linux: Download Step 1: Connect Pixel or Pixel XL to your computer via USB. Step 2: Copy and paste SuperSu zip file to your device storage’s root folder. Related How to Update Google Pixel and Pixel XL to Android 7.1.2 NPG05E Nougat Step 3 Download TWRP img file (for Pixel and Pixel XL) and save it in the same directory you had extracted Fastboot/ADB files. Step 4: Turn your Google Pixel off. Step 5: Reboot in the Bootloader mode: go to android-sdk-windows\platform-tools directory and open Command Prompt (Shift + Right-click > Open Command Prompt) and type the following command: Advertisement adb reboot bootloader (You can also turn off your phone and then hold down Volume Down key while powering it back on to get into the Bootloader mode.) Step 6: Go to android-sdk-windows\platform-tools directory and open Command Prompt (Shift + Right-click > Open Command Prompt) and type the following command: For Pixel: fastboot boot twrp-3.0.2-0-RC1-fastboot-sailfish.img – replace twrp-3.0.2-0 if you are using newer versions.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Google Says Its Employees Won’t Be Affected by President Trump’s H-1B Visa Reforms By Rafia Shaikh Apr 5, 2017 16Shares Share Tweet Submit Googlers don't need to worry about Trump’s latest immigration crackdown After the latest crackdown on the H-1B work visa program that the Silicon Valley uses to hire foreign talent, Google has told its employees that they don’t need to worry. Trump administration is rolling out a number of policy changes that will make it more difficult for tech companies to hire workers outside of the country. The changes could also affect spouses of high-skilled immigrants who currently hold the H-1B visa as they could lose their right to work. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice have promised greater scrutiny of the H-1B visa program, through which the tech companies hire high-skilled workers. However, Google is saying the changes won’t affect its employees as the company isn’t expecting any “impact to Googlers.” Related Apple, Google and Facebook Have Backed Away From Fighting Trump’s Latest Travel Ban In an email, Google’s HR team wrote to the company’s staff members explaining that their software engineering roles don’t fall into the fields that were mentioned in the new United States Citizenship and Immigration Services guidelines. The email adds (obtained by Recode): Advertisement “Wanted to quickly weigh in on behalf of the immigration team to let you all know that we’re following this and for now, don’t anticipate an impact to Googlers,” says the email to Google staff from an employee in human resources.

We’ll continue to watch the H-1B visa space closely and keep Googlers updated on any changes they need to be aware of.” President Trump has promised to take a stricter approach to immigration, which has already raised concerns in the trillion-dollar technology industry. Silicon Valley has historically relied on immigrant talent to fill key engineering roles. However, the latest changes, while making the process lengthy and difficult, won’t make it impossible for companies to hire foreign workers. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has said the companies will have to simply prove that the position cannot be filled by an American worker and that it is “complex, specialized, or unique.” Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related Uber CEO Quits President Trump’s Economic Council After Criticism Feb 2, 2017 55 Apple, Google & Other Tech Giants to Send a Joint Letter Opposing Trump’s Immigration Ban Feb 2, 2017 18 Tech Companies Reportedly Meeting Today to Legally Challenge Trump’s Immigration Order Jan 31, 2017 40 Silicon Valley Reacts to President Trump’s Immigration Orders Jan 30, 2017 26 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

As part of an ongoing investigation, DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper stated, "we found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce." Google denied the allegation, and the investigation will continue. These allegations came during a hearing in an ongoing lawsuit [press release] filed [complaint, PDF] by the DOL against Google in January arising out of an audit for federal law compliance review. Just last month the US District Court for the Northern District of California rejected [JURIST report] a settlement in a class action lawsuit between non-Gmail users and Google based on an allegation that Google illegally scanned the e-mails of non-Gmail users in their correspondence with Gmail users for targeted advertising purposes.

Whether it's an app to help manage our daily activities or the latest tech device, technology is changing on a day-to-day basis to adapt to our needs. These advances are making our lives easier and more productive. To that end, there's no shortage of movies that explore the role technology will play in the future. But when we take a minute to separate the fact from fiction, what are we left with? What do these movies tell us about what's to come? Even more intriguing, what do these movies tell us about how our identities will mold the future? How will our identities become even more important than they are today? To answer these questions, we examined three movies that explore identity in the future and examined how their assumptions might be closer to reality than we think. Let's take a closer look. Minority Report: Identity and Data Collection The 2002 film Minority Report paints an intriguing picture of America in the 2050s. A system using a combination of biometric surveillance and psychics called “Precogs” has been developed to apprehend potential murderers. As a result of capturing criminals before they act, the crime rate plummets to zero. The film focuses on Captain John Anderton, a PreCrime police officer, as he attempts to outrun the law after the Precogs predict he'll murder someone. His attempts to elude the authorities is hampered by the fact that public spaces are brimming with retinal scanners. His only option to evade capture and hide his identity is to have his eyes surgically replaced by an underground doctor. What makes the use of identity in this film interesting is the use of biometric data collection to generate holographic ads for individual retail customers. When Anderton enters a Gap store, he's greeted as “Mr. Nakamura,” who we can assume was the former owner of the transplanted eyes. This extensive use of one's identity in the future will give retailers the opportunity to provide highly sophisticated and personalized advertising experiences. Only ads that cater to you as an individual—rather than to your demographic—would be presented. In the case of Minority Report, predictive analysis based on historical purchases is used to enhance marketing and advertising strategies by singling out customers. How do we know identity will be used this way in the future? It's already happening. For Gmail users, inboxes have become a hotspot for ads. Based on the sites Google users have visited and the types of emails received, inbox ads become increasingly more targeted. Gone are the days of zero targeting, when everyone was served the same ads. Customers had no choice but to listen because there were only a handful of TV stations, newspapers, and magazines to choose from. If Minority Report is any indication of what we can expect, ads of the future will be more important for the simple fact that they'll be even more personalized and targeted to individuals. Marketers can focus on specific categories and not just general characteristics of a much broader target audience. Her: Identity and Personalized Experiences In the 2013 film Her, Theodore Twombly is a lonely, recent divorcee. In an attempt to soothe his growing depression, he purchases an artificial intelligence personal assistant. Because of its ability to adapt based on interactions, it gives itself the name “Samantha,” and he falls in love with it. Or rather, he falls in love with the illusion of the type of relationship he desperately needs. The film explores how this growing relationship provides him with the support and understanding he's been unable to achieve with other people. While the film takes place in the future, we're shown how technology can blend seamlessly into our lives and adapt to our preferences. Although the concept of developing an emotional relationship with technology seems far-fetched, we already see hints of a deepening bond as technology becomes increasingly more integrated with our day-to-day lives. There's Google Home, Amazon's Alexa, and Apple's Siri. As the Internet of Things takes off, we're going to see more of this type of integration of technology into our everyday lives. And we'll probably also see more parents using it to troll their kids. This technology is different from anything that's preceded it because it's designed to understand our identity and utilize that understanding to reduce our need to go out and find information ourselves. Google has taken this concept and created products that enable us to seek and find the information we need faster. This enhanced user experience means that we're getting information before we even search for it. Take Google Now for instance. It provides users with recommendations based on usage. Technology is moving in this direction as it becomes less of a focal point in our lives and begins to recede into the background. With Google Home, users can simply verbalize what they're looking for, thereby reducing any friction that may prevent them from satisfying their immediate needs. Google Home optimizes the user experience by relying on their identity and specific preferences. Similar to the movie Her, users can interact with Google Home to give the illusion of a two-way conversation. With this shift, identity becomes more important as our technology learns more about us than anyone else, thereby reducing our need to go out and find information for ourselves. Gattaca: Identity and Biometric Identification In the movie Gattaca, genetic engineering and state-sanctioned eugenics are used to determine a person's propensity to excel or fail. This approach divides society into two groups, essentially the “haves” (valids) and the “haves-not” (in-valids). Vincent Freeman is deemed an in-valid because he's conceived naturally without the use of genetic selection. Despite his genetic “inferiority,” he's determined to become an astronaut. In order to mask his true genetics, he uses the identity (blood, skin, hair, eyelashes, urine, and saliva) of a paralyzed man—a valid—by falsifying a finger-prick blood test to gain access to opportunities that would typically be out of reach. Despite the obvious physical differences between Vincent and Jerome, we're shown that genetics take precedence. In other words, identity is authenticated by biometrics. Though Gattaca was based on fiction, there's now an increased reliance on the use of biometric identification to determine what access people should have. Most cell phones come equipped with face recognition software or fingerprint encryption to unlock them. A sufficiently motivated hacker is going to be able to break biometrics because since it's not based on any inherent aspect of your body but rather on a digitized version of your identity, it can be misused. In other words, your fingerprint is really being stored as a digital image. Every time you put your finger on the sensor, it's producing a different image. Because you always put your finger on a different part of the sensor, the digital image needs to be flexible enough to account for that fact. As Gattaca demonstrates, as we move into a world that relies more on biometric identity, we have to understand that we can't be so stringent with what determines personal identity and resilience. If not managed properly, authentication procedures have the potential to create biased class systems or categories. “The Future is Already Here” As we continue to see advancements in technology, we should prepare ourselves for even more impressive leaps forward. With more access to our identities and with the development of progressive systems, the seeds of advancement have been sown. As our daily interaction with technology grows, it's important to remember that the need for identity metrics will also increase. Allowing companies to learn more about us enables more personalized experiences. With less effort on our part, service providers and retailers have clear insight into our needs and wants. This, in turn, allows for more technology to integrate into our lives. Technology then acts more as a companion, rather than simple tools to do our bidding. Algorithms will give our technology more indication into who we truly are at our core.

Meet or beat expectations, and provide at least decent guidance, or sellers may show up in droves. A new research report from the internet and e-commerce team at Merrill Lynch offers their earnings estimates for 25 top large and small cap companies in the firm’s research universe. They are above Wall Street estimates on 16 of the 25. We screened for the big liquid stocks, and found five that look solid for aggressive growth accounts. All are rated Buy at Merrill Lynch. Alphabet The search giant continues to expand and is even working on a driverless car now. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a global technology company focused around key areas, such as search, advertising, operating systems and platforms, enterprise and hardware products. It generates revenue primarily by delivering online advertising and by selling apps and contents on Google Play, as well as hardware products. The company provides its products and services in more than 100 languages and in 190 countries, regions and territories. Alphabet offers performance and brand advertising services. It operates through Google and Other Bets segments. The Google segment includes principal internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, such as virtual reality. The Google segment also sells hardware products: Chromecast, Chromebooks and Nexus. The Other Bets segment includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X and other initiatives. The analysts point to Google Cloud, which is the largest cloud infrastructure and engages in more technology, infrastructure research and development in headcount and dollars than any other company. That gives it the strength and wherewithal to compete with and differentiate itself from Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $1,025, and the Wall Street consensus price objective is $965.81. The shares closed Thursday at $845.09. Expedia This online travel leader is poised for a potential big first quarter. Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) is the leading internet travel pure-play with exposure to online travel in the United States, Europe and Asia. The company’s portfolio of brands includes Expedia, Orbitz, HomeAway, Travelocity, Hotels.com, Trivago, Egencia, Hotwire, Wotif, Venere and Classic Vacations. Top analysts see it as a story of improving execution, and they also think that the company is starting to finally match Priceline’s growth metrics. The company has raised its dividend and is buying back stock, both shareholder friendly actions. Expedia investors receive a 0.9% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $146 target price. The consensus target is $142.72, and shares closed Thursday at $125.67.

The company has seen a number of major advertisers withdraw their YouTube campaigns in recent weeks after growing discomfort of the association between brands and racist content, much of which seems to be existing unmonitored on the video platform. Now Bloomberg reports that Google has employed new systems that have significantly improved its hit rate for catching offending content. These new filters are designed to disable ads on videos including "dangerous and derogatory content" as well as content that promotes negative stereotypes about targeted groups or denies "sensitive historical events" such as the Holocaust. The company even claims that advertising partner Johnson & Johnson has reversed its decision to pull its ads on the back of its success. "We switched to a completely new generation of our latest and greatest machine-learning models," chief business officer Philipp Schindler said. "We had not deployed it to this problem, because it was a tiny, tiny problem. We have limited resources. "Although it has historically it has been a very small, small problem. We can make it an even smaller, smaller, smaller problem." Google also claims that toxic content has also appeared alongside around one one-thousandth of a percent of YouTube’s total ads. Note, however, that Google admits that alongside its new AI it has also employed "a lot more people" for content checking, again asking questions of the new system’s long-term viability. It was reported last week that a growing list of major global brands were withdrawing their advertising spend on YouTube due to the fear of being associated with hate speech. The Google-owned company has been rocked in recent weeks by the increased awareness of the racist hate speech that has become alarmingly common among some of its top stars. Gaming has been hard hit by controversies including the likes of PewDiePie and JonTron, although of course the problem of games pundits espousing extreme right wing views has been around for some time. Furthermore, the yanking of YouTube advertising is having a wider effect on Google’s entire ad network, with many companies defaulting back to just targeted search advertising as they no longer trust Google’s ad algorithms.

"We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," said Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, in court testimony. Though the "investigation is not complete," added another Labor official, Janet Herold, the "government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry." About a third of Google's 70,000 workers are women. Google roundly rejected the allegations. "We vehemently disagree with Ms. Whipper's claim," the company said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology." Bonnie Kristian   Google denies Labor Department accusation of 'systemic compensation disparities against women' April 8, 2017 an inside look Edit 9 senators tried to save the filibuster. Here's how they failed. April 8, 2017   Mark Wilson/Getty Images Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday invoked the "nuclear option," killing the filibuster for Supreme Court confirmation votes. Senate Democrats in 2013, then in control of the upper house, did the same thing for most other federal nominees. In each case, supporters argued the change was necessary to overcome minority obstructionism and proceed with the business of governing. Though this week's vote passed along party lines, many Republicans expressed opposition to the nuclear option earlier this year. And in the run-up to Thursday's vote, a bipartisan group of nine senators made a secret, last-ditch effort to save the filibuster. Politico reports on why they failed: [Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.)] circulated a proposal calling on senators in both parties to admit they'd abused the Senate rules to the detriment of the institution — and commit to not do so again in the future. It was designed to be painful and cathartic: Republicans would express regret for blocking Merrick Garland last year; Democrats would do the same for a 2013 rules change that set the stage for this year's nuclear option. But clinching an agreement on how Democrats would advance Gorsuch while preserving the option of blocking a nominee for the next vacancy proved impossible. The fact that the parties clashed so severely over whether Gorsuch was even a mainstream jurist undermined any confidence that senators could hold to a pact covering President Donald Trump's next Supreme Court pick. [Politico] Politico's 20-plus sources disagreed on whether the project to save the filibuster ever stood a real chance, but they agreed the "gap between the two parties was too broad and mistrust" too widespread for the group to succeed. Read the rest of Politico's in-depth account here, or check out this analysis from The Week's Edward Morrissey on whether the modern filibuster was even worth saving. Bonnie Kristian   9 senators tried to save the filibuster. Here's how they failed. April 8, 2017 Quotables Edit North Korea says the U.S. strike on Syria validates its nuclear weapons program April 8, 2017   KNS/Getty Images The Trump administration's Thursday strike against a Syrian regime air base in response to Tuesday's chemical weapons attack was "an unforgivable act of aggression against a sovereign state," a statement from North Korea said Saturday. The strike also justifies Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development program, the statement added: "The reality of today proves our decision to strengthen our military power to stand against force with force was the right choice a million times over." If North Korea is a nuclear state, the logic goes, it will be protected from similar attacks by the United States because the risk of retaliation becomes too great. These comments come on the heels of President Trump's two-day summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump and Xi "reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean peninsula" and discussed how to "convince North Korea to peacefully resolve the issue and dismantle its illegal nuclear and missile programs." Bonnie Kristian   North Korea says the U.S. strike on Syria validates its nuclear weapons program April 8, 2017 Quotables Edit Rand Paul says Trump's Syria strike is 'an inappropriate way to begin a war' April 8, 2017   "My concern has been mostly that this is an inappropriate way to begin a war, that the Constitution says war begins with a vote in Congress," Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said on CNN Saturday, reiterating his role as a chief critic of the Trump administration's strike against Syrian regime targets Thursday night. "Even George Bush, who was often treated mercilessly by the media as being so far out there, he came to Congress and asked to go to war against the Taliban and those who attacked us on 9/11. He also did the same in Iraq," Paul continued. "And so I think this is a wrongheaded notion, that we just skip the most important step — and that is whether or not we should go to war." Paul has repeatedly raised objections to the Syria strike on constitutional grounds, but he also questions the inherent merits of military intervention against the Bashar al-Assad regime. "Military action is not in our national security interest and should not be authorized," he wrote at Fox News on Friday. "Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer, and Syria will be no different." Watch Paul's CNN comments in context below. Bonnie Kristian   Rand Paul says Trump's Syria strike is 'an inappropriate way to begin a war' April 8, 2017 Crime and punishment Edit Sweden arrests Uzbek suspect in deadly Stockholm truck attack April 8, 2017   Michael Campanella/Getty Images Swedish police said Saturday they have arrested a man who is "likely" the driver responsible for crashing a stolen beer truck into a department store in central Stockholm on Friday, killing at least four people and injuring more than a dozen. The suspect is a 39-year-old from Uzbekistan and was known to intelligence agencies. Investigators found a suspect item in the attack vehicle that may be an unexploded bomb. "We confirm that we have found a device in the truck that doesn't belong there. We are now investigating its content," said Dan Eliasson, chief of Swedish Police, on Saturday. "Whether this was a classic bomb or some sort of flammable device is now a matter for our analysis." The arrested suspect will either be released or have a pre-trial hearing by Tuesday. Bonnie Kristian   Sweden arrests Uzbek suspect in deadly Stockholm truck attack April 8, 2017 This just in Edit Syrian town targeted by chemical attack suffers a second airstrike April 8, 2017   Omar Haj Kadour/Getty Images The rebel-held town in Syria's Idlib province that was hit by a chemical weapon attack on Tuesday was targeted in a new airstrike on Saturday, local sources say. It is not yet clear who is responsible for the attack, though CNN notes only Russian and Syrian regime aircraft have been observed bombing that area in the past. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in the United Kingdom, said the strike killed one woman. Russia is meanwhile in the process of moving a frigate carrying cruise missiles to the Mediterranean, apparently in response to Thursday's U.S. bombing of a Syrian government air base in response to the Tuesday incident. The American strike strike puts Washington and Moscow "on the verge of a military clash," Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Friday, labeling the strike "really sad for [Russia's] now completely ruined relations" with the U.S. and "good news for terrorists." Bonnie Kristian   Syrian town targeted by chemical attack suffers a second airstrike April 8, 2017 beating the drought Edit California's historic drought is officially over April 8, 2017   After a rainy winter, California Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday declared his state's historic, four-year drought is officially ended — at least for now. "This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner," Brown said. "Conservation must remain a way of life." California's drought emergency is over, Gov. Brown declares https://t.co/hsNpsZBzr0 pic.twitter.com/9u5QcJEVdY — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) April 7, 2017 California uses more water each year than is naturally available in the state under normal conditions, and the drought emergency remains in effect in four counties. "Water may appear to be in abundance right now," said Kate Poole of the Natural Resources Defense Council, but one wet season can't supply California's water needs longterm. Bonnie Kristian   California's historic drought is officially over April 8, 2017 A house divided Edit Kushner and Bannon reportedly attempt to smooth differences at Mar-a-Lago getaway April 8, 2017   Mandel Ngan/Getty Images Senior adviser Jared Kushner and chief strategist Stephen Bannon are reportedly attempting to smooth their differences as competing power centers in the Trump White House after reports on Friday suggested Bannon was on thin ice. President Trump ordered a "bury-the-hatchet meeting" between the two top aides while senior administration staff weekended at Mar-a-Lago, Politico reports. "Work this out," Trump said, per two accounts given to The New York Times, expressing frustration with media coverage of administration infighting. A White House statement to the Times denied the entire narrative of a potential shake-up in White House staff. "Once again this is a completely false story driven by people who want to distract from the success taking place in this administration," said White House representative Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "The only thing we are shaking up is the way Washington operates as we push the president’s aggressive agenda forward."

For those that have the need for speed, here we’ll be sharing 10 of our favorite racing games on Android. These are the best available in 2016. Playing games on our Android smartphones and tablets is becoming increasingly more popular thanks to a huge selection. Not to mention big HD displays and powerful processors inside devices like the Galaxy S7 or Google Pixel. Racing games are extremely popular but it can be hard to find the good ones. Read: 10 Best First Person Shooter Games for Android Whether you’re looking for ultra realistic racing, casual arcade fun, or want to be flying through water with turbo boosts and more, we have it all covered. Here we highlight some of the better looking games available. These are fun, free, or at least worth spending your hard earned money on. While you’re at it, take a look at these 95 best Android apps and games. Over the past year or two Android games have improved by leaps and bounds, and are getting better with each release. Not to mention Android 7.0 Nougat and its new Vulcan gaming API promises to deliver a whole new level of quality. The games detailed below will keep you busy for hours, and on the edge of your seat. We’re starting with Asphalt 8: Airborne, as it’s still my favorite all-around game on Android. Well, unless you consider Clash of Clans. Then take a peek at the slideshow below for nine other great games that made our list. As we said above, there are hundreds and hundreds of games available from the Google Play Store. And while some are decent, many of them are poor copies of others and not worth the time it’ll take to download. So instead of wasting time and data, or your money, check out this list of some of the most popular racing games available on Android right now. Many are from 2015, but more are coming soon. Asphalt 8: Airborne   1 / 10 Our first pick and still my favorite racing game to date comes from Gameloft, who has now released over eight versions of their flagship racing game for Android. Asphalt 8: Airborne does away with all the simulator realism and goes for high speeds, octane boosters, and flying down realistic streets with natural lighting, shadows, and reflections all while trying to get the most air as possible going over jumps and taking shortcuts. All of this is done while having some of the best graphics on a mobile device. Asphalt 8 delivers realistic crashes and extensive vehicle damage, it has both arcade and multiplayer modes, and the career mode will have you build up a reputation, and earn additional cars for the garage. This has been my favorite game since its release, and Asphalt 7 is still a close second. It's my go-to mobile game to show off how far mobile gaming has come, and will continue to be one of my favorites that is on every tablet or smartphone I own. There is no Asphalt 9 yet, but instead you can try Asphalt Overdrive, which is more of an endless racer. It isn't quite as fun, but still worth consideration. We're hoping for an Asphalt 9 in 2017. Those with an older device that can't play Asphalt 8, download Asphalt Nitro. It's made for budget devices. Another good option is a game called City Racer. Download from Google Play Asphalt Xtreme was just released in November, and is the same racing game we all love, taken to the dirt. It's Asphalt Off-Road essentially, and loads of fun. Not to mention some of the best graphics around. Download it now.    1 / 10 29 Responses 06/10/2015 mousavian Reply thanks 12/08/2016 ateeq Reply new car racing game https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fast.car.racing.real.speed 08/06/2015 Fahad Ullah Khan Reply Nice !

The fact that high-quality games like Need For Speed Most Wanted, Rush Rally, Bangers Unlimited 2 and Colin Mc Rae were left out just for being paid, boggles the mind (especially considering the price is 1/20th of the price you need to pay to actually finish a microtransaction tarpit game) 09/13/2016 Seema Sankadecha Reply Here is another new list of Best Android Racing Games of 2016 http://www.thegreatapps.com/blog/top-ten-best-racing-games-for-android-2016-free-download-here 10/06/2016 Sillvan Reply Hii Corey you have shared a really good information, and it’s hard to find good games to play cause many people regret after installing them and get bored of it.

Society has become obsessed with it; how to get rid of it; how to avoid it; how to spot it. Google has gone through tremendous pains to suppress it from their search engine results as effectively as possible, and they’ve succeeded to a large degree. But with success also comes failure. In this case, Google’s attempts to combat fake news have resulted in drastic changes to its algorithm; changes that pose real threats to honest journalism. Snapshot of the front of Google headquarters in Seattle, Washington. [Image by SEASTOCK/Shutterstock] If an Internet news writer ever tells you that Google is never on their mind, they’re lying. We’re borderline obsessed with it. What does Google like? What does it hate? What will it ignore and what will it favor? People base their whole careers on trying to figure out what makes Google “tick,” so to speak, though no one, except maybe those whose job it is to program its algorithm, have or will ever completely figure it out. There are several reasons for this, but more than anything it comes down to this: no one is supposed to be able to figure it out. Google “Fred” Update Sometime during late January and early February, Google made a substantial change to their algorithm. These changes impacted the entire online news community, some worse than others. Moz, a search engine watchdog, first noted this change on February 1. Within a week, Moz confirmed that a significant update of Google’s algorithm had taken place. Though at this time there’s been no official moniker given to the update by Google, unofficially it’s been named “Fred.” Google’s Latest Search Algorithm Update “Fred” – A Boon or Bane? FRED is LIVE – The latest Google search algorithm update, (possible launch date as per source: 8th March 2017). All you need to know about Fred is here in the infographic. Share your experience of meeting FRED in the comments below. #Obbserv # DigitalMarketing #SEO #NewUpdate #Algorithm #Google #GoogleFred #GoogleFredAlgorithm #SEORankings #Keywords #WebsiteTraffic A post shared by Obbserv (@obbserv) on Mar 30, 2017 at 4:50am PDT According to The Stack, Fred “wreaked havoc on a huge tranche of middling blog and news-style sites, some of which report catastrophic losses in traffic.” Some believe its purpose was to eliminate websites that generate income through generous advertising rather than valuable, factual content, but this theory has been refuted by others, who say they’ve witnessed sites with minimal ad content that once did well now failing miserably as a consequence to Google’s latest update. Dropping Google Ranking? Welcome The Latest Fred Update! https://t.co/pj4K57PgW9 pic.twitter.com/b3ipiR5oJB — Readizine (@readizine) April 8, 2017 It didn’t take long for experts to ruminate on the possibility Fred was largely implemented to filter out so-called “fake news.” Meanwhile, while many alternative media sites are suffering substantial losses in traffic in response to Fred, mainstream news agencies, though there’s evidence they were impacted by Fred’s changes at first, seem to be doing as well as they’ve always done. Outlets like CNN, Fox News, ABC, NBC, etc are automatically given good page rank because of their domain authority. Essentially this means that because of their names and mainstream status, they’re considered by Google to be more trustworthy than non-mainstream outlets. Google Fred Algorithm Confirmed & Cites Overall Quality Issues https://t.co/wS7GyzxQcR pic.twitter.com/SHtMCJsYDv — Ben Brausen (@BenBrausen) April 4, 2017 Scrutinization of Fred has suggested that in order for a site’s content to score a high Google ranking, it must contain similar information and claims as other high-ranking results. Though this works to successfully eliminate false content, it’s also a huge hindrance to honest journalism from writers of lesser-known websites. Imagine being a journalist of an alternative network, and as luck would have it, you’ve come across a huge tip having to do with a trending story. It’s big and you know it, so you race to publish the new information only to find that Google has surpassed your story because more “reputable” sites haven’t yet mentioned what you’ve mentioned. As an honest journalist, you deserve recognition and credit for that story, but the fake news hysteria, which ironically was originally coined by these so-called “reputable” sources, has cheated you out of that opportunity. Google Fact Check Now, Google has made it possible for web users to see which search results are “true” and which are “false,” as a feature of the fact-checking software first launched by the company last autumn. While on the surface it may seem like this is a step in the right direction, dig a little deeper and you’ll come to find that there are major biases at work; biases which will serve as a direct influence to whether or not content is dubbed as “true” or “false.” “After assessing feedback from both users and publishers, we’re making the Fact Check label in Google News available everywhere, and expanding it into Search globally in all languages.” Basically, the people of Google believe that you need their assistance to figure out the truth, which is, among many things, downright insulting. Google announced changes on how fact-check articles will appear in search results. Image below. Announcement here: https://t.co/GVrLO5st0C pic.twitter.com/VWSPD6SH0s — FactCheck.org (@factcheckdotorg) April 7, 2017 Even if these fact-checkers utilized by Google aren’t by themselves biased, which is certainly up for debate, they’re reliant on biased sources in their quest for the truth. Put simply, if you’re not someone who trusts the mainstream media, you probably shouldn’t have faith that Google’s fact-checking system will provide you with “the whole truth and nothing but the truth.” Barriers to honest journalism have been established. Perhaps it’s just the nature of the beast, but for those of us dedicated to factual news reporting, it’s a threat to one of the world’s most sacred of things: truth.

Lee Apr 8, 2017, 11:00am EDT Presented By tweet share Waymo CEO John Krafcik. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Where technology and economics collide Uber and Google are locked in a legal battle that could have huge implications for the future of the self-driving car industry. If Uber loses its lawsuit, it could cost the company millions and set back Uber’s self-driving car effort by months — months Uber probably can’t afford to lose. The lawsuit started when Waymo, Google’s self-driving car unit, alleged that Uber is using sensors based on stolen Waymo designs and asked the courts to block Uber from using the designs. Uber fired back in a legal brief on Friday, denying that its sensors were based on Waymo’s technology and accusing Waymo of trying to tie up a legitimate competitor with frivolous litigation. It’s not uncommon for the invention of an important new technology to be followed by legal battles over rights to that technology. Apple, for example, fought a years-long legal battle with Samsung, Motorola, HTC, and other makers of Android-based phones in the early years of the smartphone industry. Apple won some money from these lawsuits, but strategically speaking, they ended in a draw. Apple’s competitors were able to continue churning out Android-based smartphones, and Android ended up controlling a large majority of the global smartphone market. In contrast, there’s a real possibility that Waymo could beat Uber decisively in court. “This is an extraordinary case,” said William Alsup, the California federal judge who is overseeing the case, on Wednesday. His take on Google’s evidence: “I’ve never seen a record this strong in 42 years.” If the court orders Uber not to use technology similar to Waymo’s, it could set back Uber’s self-driving car project by many months. And Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has said his company will be in big trouble if another company beats it to market with self-driving technology. “If we are not tied for first, then the entity that's in first then rolls out a ride-sharing network that is far cheaper or far higher-quality than Uber's, then Uber is no longer a thing,” Kalanick said in a 2016 interview. Uber hoped that hiring some of Waymo’s top engineers would help it catch up to Waymo. But if Waymo proves that this was really a ploy to copy its technology, the move could backfire spectacularly. The lawsuit focuses on a brilliant engineer who left Google for Uber Ghostrider, Anthony Levandowski’s self-driving motorcycle. Ryan Somma The central figure in the legal drama is Anthony Levandowski, a brilliant engineer and the driving force behind the business deal that ultimately led to Waymo’s lawsuit. Levandowski quit his job at Google (now Waymo) in early 2016 and immediately started a new company called Otto. Just a few months later, in May 2016, the company unveiled a prototype of its self-driving truck technology. In August, Otto was acquired by Uber for around $700 million — a massive payout for a company that had existed for less than a year. Waymo now claims that the reason Levandowski was able to get the new self-driving truck technology working so quickly is that key elements of the design were stolen from Waymo. According to Waymo, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 confidential documents from the Waymo network in the days before he left his old employer. And Waymo believes he illegally relied on those documents to guide the development of Otto’s own technology. Levandowski isn’t well-known to the public, but in the industry it has long been obvious that he was a rising star. A 2003 profile of him as a 23-year-old UC Berkeley graduate student reported that he was already working to raise $600,000 for a startup. In 2004, the military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which brought you the internet, announced a competition to build a self-driving car that could make it across the desert. Levandowski organized a team to enter the competition, but for an extra challenge the team built a self-driving motorcycle instead of a car. They didn’t win — in fact, no one’s vehicle completed the course that year — but it was the start of Levandowski’s involvement in the self-driving vehicle industry. Levandowski went on to found a startup called 510 Systems with some Berkeley colleagues. It started out selling camera technology to Google for collecting Street View images. Levandowski joined Google to work on its mapping technology in 2007, but continued working closely with his 510 Systems colleagues on Google-related projects. Finally, in 2011 Google acquired 510 Systems, and its engineers became early members of Google’s self-driving car project. This early history may explain Levandowski’s casual attitude about working on side projects at the same time he was on Google’s payroll. Waymo now claims that in 2012, unbeknownst to Google, Levandowski took a stake in another startup called Odin Wave (for reasons that aren’t clear, it’s also went by “Tyto Lidar” in some documents) that was founded by one of his teammates from the DARPA Grand Challenge days. “Lidar” refers to a key sensor technology that allows a self-driving car to form a 3D picture of its surroundings. Waymo says that in 2013, it heard from a third-party vendor that Odin Wave had submitted an order to build a custom lidar sensor that was suspiciously similar to Google’s own design. When confronted in 2013, Waymo says, Levandowski denied having an ownership interest in the company. The next year, Google considered buying Odin Wave and asked Levandowski to evaluate the possibility. Waymo now says that Levandowski never disclosed a relationship to the company even as he was advising Google about whether to buy it. In summer 2015, Waymo alleges in a court filing, Levandowski started talking to Uber — months before he officially left Waymo to found Otto. Pierre-Yves Droz, a 510 Systems co-founder who is now a senior Waymo engineer, stated in the filing that Levandowski spent months trying to recruit engineers on his Waymo team to join his startup, and that he expected from the outset to sell the company to Uber. Droz wrote that over dinner in the summer of 2015, Levandowski “told me that it would be nice to create a new self-driving car startup and that Uber would be interested in buying the team responsible for the LiDAR we were developing at Google.” Of course, there’s nothing illegal about an experienced engineer leaving one company to work at another one. And especially in California, where the courts don’t enforce noncompete agreements, there’s nothing illegal about an engineer putting the skills and knowledge he’d developed at one job to use for a new employer. But Google’s new Waymo division believes Levandowski crossed the line by actively recruiting employees for his new venture while he was still on Waymo’s payroll, and by taking confidential documents with him when he left Waymo. Uber says it’s done nothing wrong Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch Uber responded to Waymo’s accusations in a Friday court filing. “Both of Waymo’s central premises — that former Waymo employees brought thousands of confidential Waymo documents to Uber to build a copycat lidar and that Uber’s lidar closely mimics Waymo’s single-lens design — are demonstrably false,” the company writes. Uber says it has strict policies in place to ensure that employees don’t bring confidential information with them when they join Uber from another technology company. And it says those safeguards worked: A search of Uber’s network and the laptops of key employees did not turn up copies of the documents Waymo says were stolen by Levandowski. However, this argument has a big, important caveat: Uber was unable to search Levandowski’s personal computers because he had gotten his own lawyer and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. “Uber finds itself in a complicated situation” due to Levandowski’s lack of cooperation, the ride-hailing company admitted in its legal filing. Uber also argues that its lidar technology can’t have been copied from Waymo’s because there were significant differences between them. Lidar works by bouncing a laser off nearby objects and capturing it when it bounces back. One of Waymo’s key innovations was to use the same lens for both sending and receiving these laser pulses, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the lidar system. Waymo accused Uber of copying this innovation, but Uber says that’s wrong. Uber says it began developing its own lidar in early 2015 and that it uses two lenses for transmitting laser pulses and two more for receiving them. Uber says that’s one of several key differences that demonstrates that its technology isn’t derived from Waymo’s. Uber’s reply is packed full of other technical details that the company says demonstrate that its lidar is not based on Waymo’s technology. However, most of these details are redacted in the public version of the document. The document also leaves a big unanswered question: Why did Uber pay around $700 million for Otto if it wasn’t trying to get its hands on key Waymo technologies? It’s possible, of course, that Uber was just optimistic about Otto’s self-driving truck business. Or perhaps Uber felt the Waymo veterans’ general knowledge about self-driving car technology — knowledge not protected by trade secret laws — was worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But we can expect Waymo to press this point as the litigation continues. While Levandowski has a right to invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify, Waymo will be able to portray this as a sign that Levandowski did, in fact, break the law as he was leaving Waymo. And it will look for “smoking gun” evidence proving that Levandowski and his colleagues illegally incorporated elements of Waymo’s technology into Uber’s own lidar sensors.

Samsung March Security Update Google is rolling out March security updates to its Nexus devices and Samsung is following suit with March security updates of its own. The March security patch isn’t rolling out to any devices yet but we expect that to change in the near future as the company works to deliver the patches in new Marshmallow and Nougat builds. You can get a feel for the changes via the March patch notes on the company’s website. It delivers key patches from Samsung and Google. Android Nougat Update As we’ve noted, the Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow roll out has been joined by Samsung’s new Android 7.0 Nougat update. The company’s official Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android Nougat roll outs have begun though the release is limited to select models in select regions around the world. We expect that to change in the near future. Samsung’s promised several Nougat updates in the first half of 2017 and we expect all of these upgrades to deliver new features, tweaks and fixes for lingering Marshmallow issues. Devices like the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy Note 5 should be next in line for Samsung’s version of Android Nougat. For more information on the Android Marshmallow’s successor, take a look at our Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat roundup and our Android Nougat walkthrough. Samsung’s Android Nougat update will bump devices from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0. It’s not clear when or if Samsung will bump its devices to Android 7.1.1, the most up-t0-date version of Nougat. If you own a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, we’ve put together a guide that will take you through the most important things to know about your update. If you own a Galaxy S6 or Galaxy Note 5, we’ve put together guides that will take you through the most exciting things about their release. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 7 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 10 362 Responses 01/06/2016 Ben Reply i dont see any difference in this version and what I am currently running on my S^ which I just got a few days ago. The hype and the hype over a few stupid changes is crazy. You guys in the media have to stop making things bigger than what they are, When a MAJOR change occurs, then hype and push it. Marshmallow is not a big deal. 01/12/2016 mnet Reply Marshmallow is hug Ben. It is huge because of the features you will get to control app permissions. The “wild west” days of Android apps with their crazy permissions is coming to an end. If you have not discovered all the features of 6.0 yet its because you have not looked into what is really there but instead troll the web. 03/05/2017 Sincose Line Reply Marshmallow is not working fine for many of the Samsung variants but of course after updating to Marshmallow from Lollipop, battery does not work as good as on Lollipop.

This update is about the marshmallow 6.0.1 and you must be talking about marshmallow 6.0 04/18/2016 William Ernst Reply The update sucks if you have an S5, as it has eliminated the feature that lets you transfer applications to the SD card 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply The worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device.

Here’s what I’ve been doing>> USA Jobs Resort 04/14/2016 Robert Reply I disagree. I’ve had my S6 for several months on Lollipop, finally got the update to Marshmallow from Verizon a couple weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it. My S6 has much better battery life and it performs much better in benchmarks and normal use. It’s smoother (not as laggy), apps load faster, messaging is more streamlined (no more waiting to take and send pics through text), and total control of app permissions (finally). Marshmallow is a major update and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s just a shame it took so long to actually get it. 06/21/2016 laurarussell532 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

If it’s not resolved within the two year update I’m moving to iOS. I rather deal with a company that updates regular and is more restrictive about what you can have than a company that takes months and months to update their devices. 01/11/2016 Taha Reply Chuck. Buying a nexus gives you instant apple style hardware and software updates. Cheers 01/12/2016 mnet Reply I agree with you to a point. But you have to ask yourself are you looking for updates for the sake of just getting something “new”? Most updates are minor, granted 6.0 is no minor update.

I think that it’s going to be another couple of months before I see it on my Note 4. But some great additions I didn’t expect…they’ve added scrolling screenshot functionality & the Edge is, at last amazing with half screen functionality and loads upon loads of Edge improvements. Battery life seems far better. I haven’t really dug in to fund everything yet, but so far as great improvement.

Had the S3, Note 10.1 (2012) and now Note 4 and always the same with lack of updates or extremely slow to update. Samsung needs to stop making dozens of devices with then dozens of variants of the same device! This is why they can’t update in a timely manner. If Google and Apple can make their device line up simple then so can Samsung! If Apple and Google can bypass carriers for updates and send them direct to users then so can Samsung. Until Samsung smartens up, they have lost me as a customer! Next phone will either be a Google Nexus device or (I hate to say and even think it but) iOS. I left Apple for Android but Google hates sd cards, all other manufacturers are slow to update. It’s ridiculous! Also the fact Samsung is removing the “adoptable storage” feature from their Android 6.0.1 updates is ridiculous! It’s a Google feature and Samsung and LG should have no right to remove/disable it. Give us the choice FFS! F U SAMDUNG! 02/25/2016 Too Squat Reply Note 4 owner…I think this is my last Samsung. I bought it because of the pen. Used to be an HTC buyer, they converted me to Android.

Carriers suck with the added bloatware but it shouldn’t be this damn complicated. The real reason for the wait, S7 and S7 Edge. Gotta make sure as many people buy the latest and greatest before taking care of their actual customers first.

Sir….. 02/29/2016 ThisGuyEntitledMuch Reply wow 02/29/2016 Charles Reply To the coders, thanks and all that… I’m sure that you busted a gut over this thing. but, Marshmallow doesn’t appear to be worth the risk of bricking your phone. You got Lollipop working ok.. You even dumped out a security patch. It works… It works well… The phone works as advertised. 6.0 and/or 6.0.1 for all the fanfare and hooplah… just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. Maybe after 6.0.1 gets debugged… and/or maybe a 6.0.2 rolls out – or, maybe after the security fixes for it hit the bricks… It’ll be mature to a point where it’ll install and do what it’s supposed to do without doing any harm…. That could be a year away. Hell, there is even super hype blurting out over Android N… – and, they haven’t delivered 6.0.1… Why not talk about O and P while you’re at it…. There are still a lot of un-used letters in the alphabet. There is little or no talk about a USA release… thank god. It has to start out in S. Korea… and work its way west thru Bangladesh and Botswana. Sure, fine… brick pygmy phones if you have to. Don’t release the >1Gb bloat code here – until it works… It doesn’t even have to deliver the BS hype… just don’t brick my phone. and, If at all possible – don’t gut any useful functionality – that I had in Lollipop… We all know BS when we hear it. We know it won’t do all that you say it will do…. In short.. Do no harm… Don’t release an OS that is worse than the one we got. 02/29/2016 Bharath Reply Any chance of Touchwiz update on note 4? 03/01/2016 Young_Android_Runner Reply 29Feb2016 > Marshmallow isn’t here yet but we’re already hearing about a potential successor to the Marshmallow update Huh?

The phone has gotten smoother but there isn’t any change in battery performance, at least nothing yet. A couple of features have disappeared. Like, now I cannot define the pattern of vibration when a phone rings. Bummer. I liked that. Second, while waking up the phone, the screen-light come on really slowly. Third, the Settings aren’t all same like Galaxy S7. There is no triple-press home button for one-hand use feature. Fourth, Galaxy Labs is absent. Oh well, can’t think of more at the moment. There are many more, though. Disappointing, Samsung.

It may be in settings or you may have to enter device recovery by turning it off then holding either the up or down volume while also holding power while it starts. Google search for your correct way of entering recovery. Then when you do get there, use volume keys as directionals to select clearing system cache. OK that by the power key.

If you don’t have it and don’t care, you still didn’t need to post. Let us rant and why don’t you stay quiet? Samsuck is notorious for sending out upgrades late, thanks to their crappy touchwhiz garbage. They have to make sure the newest OS is working with that and thus it takes the longest. This is my first and last samsuck device, not only because of late OS updates (and N is right around the corner), but also because of their rapid charging mode. It wears out their batteries and people have to go buy new ones after about a year. My iPhone 5 that I gave my wife, I bought at launch and it is still working flawlessly on the same battery. My samsuck nope 4 is not holding the charge it once did because of its battery issue. I won’t be buying a new battery, however, I will be buying a new phone. And if I have to sell a kidney to afford and iPhone then so be it. 03/22/2016 Mathew Bolles Reply I received my update on my US Cellular S6 two days ago.

From what I can tell…. No one involved in the process seems to know what the process is. Supposedly, it is really rolling out some where… Botswana… Bangladesh… the Punjab in India. It is rolling of obscure tele-cos… with 10s of 100s of customers… The smaller the better. No projected or predicted or implied delivery dates have been met – any where. Those that got it – and, it worked – don’t seem to have a problem with it… even if it comes with its own completely new set of anomalies. Those that got it and it bricked their devices… simply disappear into non-digital existence. There seems to be some people that may or may not have it… that just love it to death. They are others seeing it as a cure for imagined ills. Then their are a few walking wounded that actually did get it… And, it didn’t deliver as promised. Bottom Line…. So far, it’s a huge non-event… and, that may be the good news… Some devices are skipping this promised land – for the next new – not quite there – version N. Which one must assume will be as nebulous as the nearly existent Marshmallow. This would all be a horrible fate if there was a problem with Lollipop to begin with. Fortunately, Lollipop isn’t all that bad. These promised improvements are like chasing mirages in the dessert… That can be a real problem if you are dying of thirst. The problem for the Android Overlords is that they can’t get any one thirsty for the new products…. Rumors, innuendos, and power of suggestion will only get you – but, so far. Plus, if you deliver one of these half-baked products – and, it bricks millions of devices… that a hell-of-a-lot of negative advertisement to get over. So, the latest update on the update… is that it is still kind of there but not there. No carrier has a completed roll out for all their devices. No device manufacturer has a completed roll out for all their makes and models on all carriers. There isn’t even a single device that is up and running on all carriers. It’s just one very specific make, model, – possibly even a specific block of serial numbers – within a model… pops up with a roll out on – one very specific carrier – usually some where outside the US. This is touted as progress…. Where – in comparison – Apple pulls a roll out and gets 80% of their products updated in a month… Still, ya have to admit…. Marshmallow is worth every penny ya paid for it. 03/24/2016 Jeffrey Gohlke Reply US Cellular S6 updated to 6.0.1 today 3-24-16 03/24/2016 Thersathomas Reply 203=1m­­­­­­­­­y neigh­­­­­­­­­bor’s mo­­­­­­­­­m m­­­­­­­­­akes $80 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e int­­­­­­­­­ernet .

However the update to 6.0.1 on the note 4 has a few issues so far, after the upgrade all my Bluetooth connections were wiped out and reconnecting is an issue because I have to reboot the phone and restart the headset 1 or 2 times before the phone sees the headset, I also found that one of tge greatest additions in marshmallows has been left out of the update and that is the theme engine, I mean really what sense does it make to leave out one of the best features, please put out an update that adds this feature back. Leaving out a major update at this stage of the game makes no sense at all.

Sure, no one wants to rush anything… Why risk bricking your phone? The customers didn’t demand this. The customers aren’t really feeling the burn here… Yet, the vaguest reference of a siting in the most obscure of countries and the smallest of carriers – gets absurd pronouncements. It’ll happen when it happens. About the only good thing you can say about it – is – that it’s worth every penny you paid for it. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Here’s my 2¢. I’m glad my Note 4 got it as it is an update, it looks OK and works. I don’t like that Sammy took away the ability to move apps to the SD card and that I’ve gotta put the password in every time I reboot the phone. Other methods like fingerprint scan won’t work till after it’s fully rebooted via entering the password. I don’t think I’ve got extra emoji or wherever the modified battery saver was. It did come with a generous supply of Sprint/TouchWiz bloat as usual, but maybe a bit lighter by a few percentage points. I’m glad I didn’t pay for it though. And the next device for me will be called Nexus. See what you get for 2¢. :-P 03/30/2016 Wilson Reply After running the new update my S6 now randomly re-starts itself and I would say roughly half the phone calls are going directly to voicemail.

Maybe some country some where with a sizable telecom – will roll this thing out and get it to work. Buyer be ware… If you got it “on” your new device – don’t panic… it’ll probably work just fine. Upgrading older devices – is always a bit of a crap shoot. If you bought older legacy hardware and update prior to loading your old apps…. that might work ok, too.. Marshmallow isn’t all that evil… It just can’t cope with all the possible combinations of footprints left over from old OS’s and legacy apps. Nothing ever has. Nothing ever will. The glacial roll out is probably a blessing – in that it is sparing you from the infinite new anomalies that you will encounter… The purported enhancements/improvements – may – or, may not – work as advertised. but, At least, you have gotten used to the quirks in your current device. Why suffer the trials and tribulations of different quirks – whilst Beta testing the lasted flavor. I guess that I long for the daze when one could stone false prophets. Back in the good ole daze, if the prophet spoke and got it wrong – they took him out to the gates of the city and stoned him… Not much of a retirement plan… But, it really cut down on people making idiot claims and speculations. 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Verizon has already inflicted/infected the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 users with Marshmallow…. Batteries dying… WiFi croaking… no access to the AppStore… BlueTooth disconnecting…. Who will be the next victim? Will they bless the 6s class? What did they ever do the Verizon… other than subscribe. The good news here – is – that as glacial as Android is with the updates, they aren’t all that essential. The updates sell features that you have never had… you are being told that you want them. Also… it’s great that it’s free… The update is worth every penny that you paid for it. So – not getting something that you don’t need and didn’t ask for – for money that you never paid… isn’t all that bad of a deal… Then Verizon steps in with its non-value added contribution. This slows the process even further. By the time Verizon is finished bloating the code, even more lettered releases appear on the horizon… N, O, P, etc. Which may displace the much exalted M – all together… and, Is that bad? You are still not paying for it. You still didn’t ask for it. You still don’t need it. So, does it ever matter, which version of the next shiny new OS that you aren’t actually getting? The hype seems totally unaffected. These are the same guys that barely got KitKat and Lolipop to stop coughing up blood… and, those two combined only pulled 37% of the market share for Samsung. Marshmallow is languishing at 2.3% – after 4 months. This is almost as much fun to watch as MicroSloth WinWoes rolling out their free WinWoes Tin…. 03/31/2016 Amy Sweet Reply Did the Marshmallow update and I can no longer lock my phone. I have received help online but it only band-aids the issue. It stays locked once then no locking. How can this be fixed?

Now my autocorrect replaces REAL words that I have spelled CORRECTLY with words it THINKS I meant and makes me look stupid. Someone can text and ask how I am. I reply “I’m good!” And it corrects the word good and changes it to “not” so I wind up sending “I’m not!” It’s beyond agitating!!! And if I turn it off completely, then I’m left with it correcting nothing at all. So now I’ll have to download a less idiotic keyboard to use and eastern space on my note 5 to do so. this is BS. And that’s just one of the issues. 04/13/2016 Samantha Castaneda Reply I am having the same issue. It is driving me crazy!! If you find out how to fix it, please let me know! 05/05/2016 Christina Merager Reply I’m so glad I’m not the only one. It’s absolutely driving me insane. It’s unbelievable! The fact that the word is spelled Completely correct and it just changes it??? Why?? And sometimes to just a letter! But I’ve noticed it only does it for words that you add a (?) Or (!) to the end of. Not that that helps. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply I just wanted to put the info out that my Sammy & Sprint Note 4 had received the Marshmallow 6.0.1 near the end of March. My update was just short of 1.4 GB. It has improved my Note by making it feel smoother and more intuitive. It seems to also be a bit lighter as in not so bloated, but I’m unable to confirm that as a fact. The only area I’m disappointed, and it’s a great disservice to us owners in my opinion, I no longer can move apps to the SD card. It’s not even accessable, as in moving apps to it, unless I’m missing something. This in my opinion is a real failure by Sammy. It just confirms my previous plan to go Nexus next time around. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Sorry for my redundancy at the end there. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply OK so there actually IS a way to transfer files from phone memory to a mounted SD card. If anybody’s interested, I’ll post the path to get file transfers done the Marshmallow way. Standby… 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply This may help some or all who have received Marshmallow and are having issues with the apps not acting right, the Wi-Fi or etc. This is worth trying once. Learn where you do this on your particular phone as I don’t know about all is of them. I do know I did this to my Sammy Note 4 on Sprint and it helped with crashing apps after updating. Clear all cache. Then reboot. See if it helps. Hint: some devices have a setting menu for this, others you shut off the phone then get to the restore screen to clear cache. Afterwards in either, do a reboot if possible. 04/09/2016 Landon R Caviness Reply Come on AT&T… By far the slowest carrier for updates… 04/10/2016 Ehsan Reply I am overall pleased with the marshmallow update in note 5 features are great interface just goto better, the only thing annoying to me is the grey strip on the top notification panel where battery indicator time etc are located.

Before, switching back and forth between fingerprint and nothing was super easy. Use fingerprints to identify, choose none, that’s it. Now it is fricken ridiculous and annoying as hell cause it asks for your backup password or code, then you select none, then it ALWAYS says cancel/delete fingerprints/keep fingerprints, even if you select keep fingerprints it asks for you to create a backup passcode TWICE which you already have!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Go to Galaxy Apps or Play Store to update apps. 04/21/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow… 6.0.1 – over hyped… bloated… non-plused…. overall = not bad. For a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ / with Verizon, it’s not all that bad. My phone did not brick. My phone is not coughing up blood. The battery does not die… though – I’m not quite sure that the super enhanced improvement is there… The battery is doing ok.. not noticeably worse. The graphic depiction of projected duration is longer… I haven’t tried running it out to 12 hours yet… I don’t run enough BlueTooth peripherals to show a problem… It says its still there… I’m taking it at its word. The WiFi… may have had a problem – or, not…. The home WiFi didn’t skip a beat. The historical archive of pre-existing connections did ok, too… Scanning for potential – new – WiFis could be a problem – or, not… it could just work differently. I’ve had to re-register on a couple of hubs… So far, no big deal. The phone does not get mysteriously hot… or, cold… It does not randomly buzz, vibrate, reboot – or, speak in tongues. All the apps seem to have made it. The app store(s) are still there… — there is a special permission for non-PlayStore apps… Click a button and the Amazon apps, etc… are good to go. The GPS is doing ok. It appears to be doing every bit as well as the old Lollipop… It may be a schoosh faster – snappier. Schoosh…is a technical digital device term = barely noticeable. The user interface “is” slightly different… enough to annoy… I can’t see much of a wow factor in it. The “edge” feature is different… (? better ?)… It’s only better if you were a heavy user to begin with. If you had never bonded to the feature to begin with.. this probably isn’t going to get you anymore involved. So far, Marshmallow is a benevolent improvement. It has done no noticeable harm. I haven’t lost any capabilities. It may even be an improvement – overall. I can’t dodge the feeling that I am missing something… with all the fanfare, there should be some sort of wow-factor that justifies all the hype… Sometimes ya just have to take it as it is… at least, it didn’t set me back. I would recommend it – if I only knew – why? 04/21/2016 Elle Reply Thank you 04/22/2016 Lisa Miceli Reply UGH…not a fan of the update at all.

Is there a user/guest mode on the update for samsung galaxy s6? Most of the features doesn’t work now. Like the notifications are gone, developer options says “it doesn’t work for this user”, multitasking app doesn’t work, home and back button is the only one the works. Please help. 05/02/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow 6.0.1 doesn’t seem to be all that bad…. Eventually, it automatically downloaded, then the annoying window was there for about a week every time you unlocked the screen. I finally consented for it to install… (Verizon Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus) It blinked and buzzed… blinked some more.. went dark… for awhile… lit back up… did some more blinking… buzzed…. – after a bit, it looked like it was gunna actually do sumthun… The start screen lit up and it jingled its jangle… Then there was much flashing and an occasional buzz…. Once it finished convulsing, I went for a shut down, which it did. After a few moments of calm, I started it back up again. This time it started with less fan fare… about as quickly as Lollipop… It still wanted to do some tweaking… So, for the first half hour or so – it was clunky. Whatever the upgrade is – it takes time to digest. Over the following week or so… mileage has varied. Nothing bad… = but, no wow factor either. The battery usage is some where between psychotic and bewildering. Sometimes it predicts 8 hours… sometimes 3 days. There are weird slopes in the discharge curve, which effect the battery life prognostications. It may depend on signal strength, whether or not WiFi is enabled… and/or the strength of the WiFi signal.. It may also be effected by back ground app updates and the relative signal strengths during those processes.. and, There may be god knows what going on with apps optimizations. I have not let this thing go for 3 days and attained the promised duration… Before I could get 8hr, 12hrs… maybe 16 hrs… before an auto shut down. The best to date with marshmallow – I’ve gotten down to around 30 – 40% in power savings mode in about 22 hrs…. which is an improvement. I just don’t know if I can believe it. The digital services seem to be a bit snappier, quicker. No big difference with calls, gps, bluetooth, or WiFi… The searching and notifications of “new” WiFi signals may be different – but, the devices seems to connect to the old connections – ok. Basically, It hasn’t screwed much of anything up…. I have a very undemanding regimen for the device. What I had it doing – it still does, which is all I asked for. The new “can’t live without features” – eh… just not all that into them, yet. They aren’t bad… I bought the edge plus for the bigger screen – not so much for the edge technology. There’s nothing wrong with it… just wasn’t a big deal to begin with. With all the tapping, dragging, swiping, pinching, spreading… another way of doing the same stuff just adds another layer of confusion to the process… Still, the edge stuff works… The edge bar is bigger.. If I used it, it would be helpful. I can definitely say, that it was worth every penny I paid for it. It has done no damage. No data lost. No performance lost. No functionality lost. The learning curve for the new features is negligible. This positions the device to take advantage of new features in my existing apps. So far – so good…. It may be a benefit for battery usage and charging It will probably be better on my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2… 05/02/2016 Dustin Hall Reply My S6 updated to Marshmallow this morning and I’m getting all these errors: messaging app totally not working, laggy overload for every app, not recognizing my thumbprint, battery draining exceptionally fast.

I bought the Galxaxy S6 just to I could use VR Gear .Other than VR, I don’t see any practical iuse for it. Even the most basic things (like finding the IMEI were difficult) and it doesn’t seem to flow s fluid as iPnone does. No iCloud, no iTunes, no FaceTime, no seamless integration with Mac. I will say this: I love being able to add extra stprage to the Android, and though Google Maps and YouTube works great on the Android, gut not on the iPhone.

I like to keep my phone on silent 24/7 so I don’t bother others, so before I updated it, it had a solid long vibrate and was able to feel it to let me know I got a message but now it’s just 2 really fast buzzes that I can barely feel….it tells me I can set the vibration to the pattern I want but it’s still the 2 quick buzzes….can anyone help me or has anyone had the same problem happen to them??? 05/10/2016 Zachary Munden Reply I wanted to tell everyone that U.S. Cellular has sent out the 6.0 update! 05/11/2016 Brian Reply I wanted to pass this along to owners of the Galaxy Note 4 SM-N910AZKEATT. I am an AT&T customer and like many of you I have been awaiting the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update, but I have been waiting for it for very different reasons. Some owners of the phone may be waiting for it for the same reasons as well. Here is the problem:   Since the internet released that AT&T rolled out the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update overseas, Google App vendors have been upgrading their softwares for the Note in anticipation of the Marshmallow Platform Update. If you are like me and you have been paying attention, these Google Play Apps update sometime 1 to 5 times weekly. With the updates being installed, the phone begins to freeze in certain applications. The phone may allow you close out the application so you may relaunch it, but in my instance this also means removing the battery cover (waiting for a time) and restarting the device. The reason I have now been told 5 times by AT&T tech reps is that the phone has not been updated with the software needed to support the updated Apps. So basically, between 1 to 6 times daily my device freezes.   Now, when I became upset about this was when I was told to upgrade to a new device, instead of being told when the Marshmallow Update would be released. Basically, my device is acting like it has a virus but is actually working as intended but is having a problem with software in Apps versus Platform issue. This meant I was being told upgrade a perfectly good working phone when there was nothing actually wrong with it. I got to thinking about how many AT&T customers are being told this, who may not be asking the right questions and I became even angrier, as they are throwing money at the company for a problem that is easily fixed:   1.       Either they indicate the Galaxy Note 4 is not going to be upgraded in the US, which causes vendors to stop notifying your phone to upgrade Apps. 2.       Or, they upgrade the phone to Marshmallow Software in the US post haste.   Basically I am outlining a very poor customer service issue. This is either due to AT&T’s negligence, Samsung’s negligence, or Googles. When you call to speak with anyone about this, they point the finger elsewhere as the problem. Warranty sent me a refurbished device to see if it will work better for me. It is on its way. I doubt it will, because of the issues I have been having. I thought I would pass this along to encourage all with a Galaxy Note 4 to call AT&T if you have been told to upgrade your device unnecessarily.   I upgrade, normally to a new phone 1x a year. As a present to myself on my birthday. This is the first time I did not upgrade as I was not happy with the lack of expandable memory in the Note 5. So I kept the phone. So now almost 2 years later, I am having all of these problems with a perfectly good phone and due to lack of SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  I hope me explaining this issues helps address your problem if you are having the same issue yourself. I encourage you to complain. Perhaps this will induce them to release the software, or finally release that they have no intention of doing so. Which also fixes the problem. 05/16/2016 Eric Johnson Reply Very nicely said. You brought out all the problems I was having. After I read your very long message, I was really with on most points. My final thought was I’m going to have to complain and complain. So like you said, complain about these issues were having. Maybe, just maybe that will work. Let’s hope that works. 05/11/2016 Shanna Hall Reply My Galaxy S6 Says That It Is Up to date But My Phone Is Still On lollipop. I haven’t even gotten the option to get marshmallow yet.

Is it because of people leaving comments? It’s pretty dumb if that’s the case.

Google customers are already running Android 7.0 while the rest of use wait for 6.0.1 which really offers no great new features unlike N which has inline replies split screen for multi tasking, night and day modes and hundreds of new features Samsung won’t ever get. Most Samsung’s still run lollipop, while I run the new modern OS Android 7 which came via an OTA as soon as I got my lg nexus which runs pure Android not some dodgy rip off touch wiz crap. Samsung’s owners are some of the last to ever get updates even smaller brands already have marshmallow out of the box. I also get updates before any other brand for the life of the phone not for a limited time like none Google branded phones. I like to get my updates fast not years after its release. 05/17/2016 Brodie Yg Reply And I can’t believe how people think it’s hard to find an imei number in Android it’s a 5 digut dialler code *#06# it’s that simple unlike Apple were you have to go through multiple screen to get such information. 05/17/2016 TBen Reply Te reason why most people buy Samsung phones and not Nexus is because Nexus is just a piece of crap.

The battery blather… – all the hype about improved battery performance – is a bit weird. The prognostications as to when it will die are all over the place. Sometimes it thinks that it can run for daze on the existing charge… sometimes just 6 to 8 hours… It “does” seem to re-charge faster. It doesn’t seem to be overheated when it does so. So far, it has been benevolently benign…. No lost data… No lock ups. It still works about like it did with Lolipop… I have noticed an occasional re-boot, on its own.. No boot loops. Some apps are a bit snappier and faster… some aren’t… some are the same. It could just be the calm before the storm… The chargers, the cables, the device hardware and OS have come into temporary alignment. We all know that it won’t last…. Sooner or later 5G will drop… = new hardware, new chargers and new cables… the OS will be gawd knows what by then.

Mashmallow,go get toasted. You have caused my phone to overheat, slow its connection to almost anything, freeze so I can’t see my unlock pattern with the keyboard constantly coming up on my Homecreen. Finally the best bit, I always clean out old apps and crap to stop security issues and the CPU slowing down, and I no tech geek. So I should get more than five hours out of a battery charge, when all I doing is leaving it switched on? Samsung – Happy for you to send me a new phone.

The security patch worked… Worked = didn’t brick the phone. Differences in performance = negligible. Additional features almost unnoticeable. Improvements = possibly… then again – maybe not. At least, this stuff does no harm… and, It’s worth every penny ya paid for it…. Will the next security fix – really – fix anything… It won’t matter. The guys out there hacking code are so far ahead of the security patches – that they aren’t loosing sleep over the security patches. The security patches only patch found leaks anyway. Will Nougat fix the security issues… = probably not… but, it will make life difficult enough on the device owners to make them think that security has improved.. The hackers are way ahead of the process. They’ll have Nougat leaking while it’s still in beta. So.. we will get yet another candy flavor – this year… That will fulfill our un-expressed desires… They’ll add stuff that we didn’t ask for, telling us that we can’t live without it. They’ll sell it as a security necessity, whilst working on all the dozens of known security compromises. And, roll out a bug fix / security patch weeks after they drop the barely out of beta Nougat. All this does not matter to me. I’m in this for the damn phone. So long as I can make calls / receive calls – I’am ok with all the update/patch bull$hit… Just don’t brick the phone. 08/25/2016 sadsds Reply who can tell me when malaysia will get marshmallow update for galaxy a8(-a800f)? 08/26/2016 Ray Reply I just got the Marshmallow update for my AT&T S5 today.

I also just received the update for the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet. I’m glad they supported this tablet but they clearly did as minimal work as possible. There’s almost no visible change whatsoever. No change in notifications or app drawer at all. Some very slight changes in the Settings menu and that’s about it. I am eager to try bonding the SD card with the main storage memory though as the 16 GB tablets have never cut it. 09/12/2016 MarshmallowForcedFacortyReset Reply I was woken up this morning around 1:30 to my phone making the tmobile sound. I get up and it said the update failed, I selected to have it try again and it forced a factory reset on my phone. All my contacts and out of my 200+ contacts I have 11 now. None of my bookmarks for internet browsers are there. I can’t seriously be the only one. I have a Samsung J7, model number SM-7J00T, and I’m in Washington State. Even things some of the things I had saved on my SD card got wiped. So you can imagine I’m beyond many colorful expressions, especially with the line of work I’m in and the fact I’m also in school right now.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 102 Plus 1 on G+ 151 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares310 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

[Update: Official] Google Keyboard is now Gboard with v6.0 update—includes integrated search, dedicated number row, multiple active languages, and more [APK Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/12/17 2:10am PDTDec 17, 2016 80 Plus 1 on G+ 242 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares405 Applications Google News Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion. Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. It's not only a name change, though. There are a few important new features, including a search shortcut and true multi-language support. The update is still rolling out, and Google has not yet posted an official changelog. Here's what we've spotted so far. G button (enabled in settings) offers quick access to search from the keyboard Pop-out toolbar (when G button not enabled) provides access to themes, settings, one-handed mode, and search Optional dedicated number row Up to three active languages with preference for one (previously had to switch) Gesture typing is now called Glide typing. Search for emoji Rearranged emoji panel with group selection at bottom Emoji have bright halo effect around them GIF button is always shown, but disabled in apps without support. We'll update if we spot anything else, but this should be most of it. Keep in mind, the G button is optional because you can still access integrated search from the toolbar pop-out. It's just one extra step. It's up to you if you prefer to just have the button. That's cool and all, but the dedicated number row will make a lot more people happy. You have to turn that on in settings as well. Those on the team who speak multiple languages seem quite excited about the multiple language support too. You can actually type in up to three of them without manually switching keyboard modes. This is similar to the way SwiftKey does it. The update is just starting to roll out, but we've got the new version on APK Mirror (Android 4.2 and higher). Note, it's in a different area of APK Mirror than the old Google Keyboard, but it is just an update. Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion.

Brad "Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. " AbbyZFresh iOS users barely even use Swiftkey. Let alone Gboard. K.P. Smith Good info. Ryan should include that in the very first sentence of this article that your commenting on ... Marko Šaric Great. Now I'm smearing egg on my phone screen cause I can't wait until I finish eating. Downloaded. Robert Trance You could have used voice control if ON?!! Marko Šaric It's not a big deal. It got wiped off. Robert Trance What phone if i might ask...? Marko Šaric Nexus 5x. jesuguru Knuckles (for screen)? Fork and knife (for eggs)? Marko Šaric Hand for dipping bread in egg yolk. Dominic81 "multiple active languages" FINALLY!!! WORPspeed THIS!!! SO much this! I was excited for gboard, but lack of this was holding me back, but reading that it is now included, I can say ADIOS SWIFTKEY! Or maybe it doesn't work as good :P Swiftkey isn't bad, just excited about gboard :D motoridersd Same! I love SwiftKey, but it can do some annoying things from time to time. I'm definitely going to be check out this new Gboard. WORPspeed And I already switched back to swiftkey. The delete swipe gesture on gboard is just horrible, it should just delete 1 word per swipe, not every either 1 letter or the whole sentence.....needs an undo button. The layout...well I'm just used to Swiftkey's layout and the way swiftkey is smart enough to isnert a space after a comma....small things that make gboard a horrible experience for me. I do keep it around incase I want to sent a gif/meme image, it's easier switching keyboards then apps :D motoridersd Yeah, the placement of the question and exclamation marks on Gboard is awful. Too many taps to get to them (they're probably hiding behind another key, but I didn't go hunting for them). Not getting a space after a comma, or getting a space after a word when putting in a question mark was annoying. The delete gesture is definitely not good on Gboard. Jordan Long press m or n is too many taps for question marks and exclamation points? Or press and slide on the period key? They're all very easy to get to. Also the slide-to-delete action is great. I don't know of any keyboard that does it in a significantly better way. motoridersd Turns out I had the symbol setting turned off, so I didn't see any of the characters on the letters or the period. The slide to delete on Swiftkey works very well because it works on the whole keyboard, not just on the backspace key. I've been spoiled by just swiping anywhere to delete a typo. You have to disable flow typing for this to work, but I don't miss that feature. Zorkos You don´t need an undo button. After you delete something the deleted text will appear as a suggestion Urs Müller It also doesn't seem to predict the next word. Instead it shows options for the currently swyped word... Also back to Swiftkey for now. Rapper_skull My dream came true. Rod Our* Rod What? Like in Swiftkey? rauldzmartin Exactly. Mario Porfírio Souza I hope that feature works well, because in swiftkey dont work well HARAMBE It doesn't even correct italian words with some french shit! GLORIOUS Vincent Bye bye SwiftKey samiazza Can somebody explain how does this work? Georgiy Alexandrov I guess it will predict words for both languages depend on what you type in, without need of switching languages manually. Apps By Usman basically what swype provided years ago :) (it's good to see google adapt it) bat0nas Exactly. Been using multiple language in Swype for years. HaltestelleLuitpolthafen I text in both German and English, but 75% of the time in English. I don't have to go into settings and manually switch it from English to Germany anymore, I can have it do it on the fly and set it to prefer English since that is what I predominantly speak. Felix /Offtopic When I interpret your username right you're from Mannheim? Why do you speak English predominantly? ;) mitchilin You don't have to go into settings. Just press the world icon on the keyboard and it changes language instantly. I've been doing this for years with German. snoop doge what do you exactly mean by it? Ashish Bogawat It is a good start, but Swiftkey has quite a headstart with support for many more languages. It (Swiftkey) even does English & Hindi, even though they use different scripts. I type in English and it suggests matching Hindi words along with the English suggestions. Ash Google has that as well, but that keyboard is Google Indic keyboard prediscover no asian language support though :( Ash Hindi, Tamil etc are Asian language. Fir Chinese there is seperate keyboard prediscover I thought Hindi had a separate keyboard too jenderalcilik I too excited for this. I installed right away after reading that sentences. I mean I always loved Swiftkey, but sometimes I hate it when it loads so slow when I switch from app to app. I hope this worked well. Eddy Nelson Lopez This is so épico ahora puedo change languages sin tener que touch the world icono 😂😂 Total Insecurity Hahaha^^ Robert Trance LOL, you so won this thread.... Avishek Jajajajaja Lord Argyris One upvote, duly earned. El_Big_CHRIS My main reason for sticking to SwiftKey, maybe I'll finally ditch it iiku it is also available for chrome spellchecking. Vratislav Jindra "multiple active languages" I HATE IT SO MUCH!!! I've never used it on other keyboards which had this feature. When I'm tapping, the keyboard usually guesses the language correctly. But when I start the text with swiping, it's more like 50:50 - sometimes it guesses the correct word, but very often it also offers me a word from a different language. I'd rather keep pressing the "switch language" button on my keyboard to switch languages manually instead of relying on a technology which fails half the time. bidou I don't like it either. It always writes the wrong word from the wrong language. You can disable it in the keyboard options and go back to the normal "press the switch language icon" type. Vratislav Jindra You're right, I must have missed that setting. Thank you very much! Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez It's happening!! Aleluya! I've been waiting eagerly for this feature since Google Keyboard supports Gif images. Sorry Swiftkey but now is time to move on. HopTzop Too bad it doesn't work well, at least here it's a pain in the arse. Also sometimes doesn't get the whole sliding and gives just a letter, sometimes it gives a totally different word that has nothing to do with what you slide, but happens to start with that letter. They just made me buy Swype which feels like it's reading my mind and runs buttery smooth. Bewear ARM64 only :c aSquard http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-release/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-armeabi-v7a-android-apk-download/ Bewear Thanks. Brian ARM64 though :( Phoenix FUUUUDGE Andy Roid Whaaaa Adrianus AJ Nadeak There's an ARM version available. Michael Carr Can't say I'm a fan of the name change, but the new features sound cool. Downloading! Phoenix OMG is this really happening ? is this really happening ? FINALLY Carson Saldanha Ohh yeah... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif Phoenix I spoke too soon, it's still not happening for ARM owners lol just ARM64 Carson Saldanha Hopefully APKMirror will have the arm version soon. Artem Russakovskii Up now. Volodesi A number row? Finally. I can stop using SwiftKey. k0n And symbols hinting! I can have it set up almost exactly like SwiftKey now, but with added benefits and no extra app required :) FrozenHotChocolate Trying this right away!. But will still need a lot of improvements on the predictions front to pull me away from Swiftkey though. Michael Schaap Neat. Looks like it finally has most of the features I'm using Swiftkey for. (Number 1: multiple languages simultaneously – I tend to type in meerdere talen tegelijk; number 2: number row.) I guess I'll have to try it out and see if it beats Swiftkey yet. (Its prediction is still scarily accurate, though.) Rod It's been said here that it now supports multiple languages simultaneously. Michael Schaap Indeed. That's what I'm saying. Rod It's like a dream came true, until I saw the arm64 requisite.. Comediante "Optional dedicated number row" - It was about time! Only thing I miss is the hability to theme choosing colors (primary/accent) from a material color pallete and not just choose from a limited theme gallery. Jaime Andres Salame Borja Does it have Gif search? AdamH Yup, only works in Hangouts tho.. Artem Russakovskii Not only. In Messenger too. Badouken And Allo :P Abhilash Bingi Yup, but the app has to support it. Only Messenger and Hangouts do as of now. Rod No love for 32 bit. :( Baalinooo Not available for Nexus 6 then? :( Ten Bears not yet anyway... Rod Nope. CD RW ARM apk now available ntomka You don't have to wait for long. I got it through Google play update to my Honor 6 Plus, which is a 32bit phone. 😃 Rapper_skull Then upload the APK to APKMirror. EDIT: Never mind, it has already been uploaded. Rod Excellent news. Thanks! Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9835dd11c8683e36c4fcf70d1cd5c1ccbb48c6158a3019cd0c72fdcb6fce9949.gif Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif mx3 But no emoji prediction :( Caleb Lee ☹️ someone755 This guy does not use Gboard. cowboysfanzz Use Textra with Gboard it's heaven mx3 This has nothing to do with emoji prediction. cowboysfanzz Yes. Textra has emoji prediction XerBlade But it's a single SMS app, not something that magically adds stuff to the keyboard, so it doesn't help you in literally every other app on your device. wade_county I must be blind, where in the settings is emoji prediction in Textra? Corey Kinard If only Textra would use, or allow as an option, stock Android's quick reply in the notifications (where it sticks) and also added the stock inline reply option in heads up messages. It feels so cluncky to have their huge "quick reply" screen pop up now. I guess they could slim the app a bit by dropping the GIFs too since it's in Gboard. Marcus Clendenin You can search in the emoji keyboard. It's not as nice as the emoji prediction in Swiftkey but it does help when trying to find an emoji Cakefish Emoji search doesn't work for me. Just says "data for emoji search is not available". Weird. Checked permissions. Checked internet connectivity. Marcus Clendenin I saw a reddit comment that said the initial download needs to happen on WiFi? So maybe try doing that. I haven't been on WiFi today so I can't confirm whether that works Cakefish You sir, are a gentlemen and a scholar! Thanks! Jacques Ligier Can anyone confirm whether it works? Robert Trance I can predict for you... Marko Šaric Poll: What was your first search ever with gboard for android? AfrodanJ Pictures of Santa PHLAK What about gif support? Kyle Gospodnetich It's been there for months. Aaron I see it but it's crossed out here. Guess it only works on apps that support it. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, the button is now permanent, just disabled in app that don't support it, which is different than the previously confusing contextual GIF button. JSo You can now do a search with the keyboard which will pull up gifs in the results like it does by hitting the "gif" button. I tried it in Inbox but it inserts the link and not the gif itself. Anthony Castanza Its actually happening!! But what are we going to complain about now?! Oh wait, Allo. Nevermind. Michael Kennedy Fuckin' Allo... :( rauldzmartin Is it not killed by Google yet? Cesar Something something no sms fallback... Rapper_skull Multi-language is not exactly what I wanted. I now see IT - EN - ES, meaning that I will receive suggestions for Italian, English and Spanish. But what I really wanted was scrolling the spacebar to switch language, so that I can type Greek letters while writing. Unfortunately writing math will still be slow. Martin Can't you just tap the "change language" key? One tap, and there you have your Greek keyboard. Rapper_skull Nope, I also have other keyboards, so a lot of taps are needed. Martin I'm not talking about the "Change keyboard" button. I'm talking about the "change language" key next to the space key. You can enable it in the settings ("Show language switch key"), and it lets you cycle through your language with single taps. Rapper_skull Like the default Android button, it still cycles between keyboards. Martin That's strange. I have four different keyboards installed, and the language switch button only cycles through the different languages in Gboard for me. YouNex Long press number row for (some) Greek letters ! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad08d55f06a775a882ce447cac20fc395dae92cb2d45714f508054225311896c.jpg Rapper_skull Doesn't work for me :( YouNex Android version/GBoard version ? Rapper_skull Android 6.0.1, GBoard 6.2.18.151907649 YouNex I updated to GBoard 6.2.22 and it's gone. I think you'll need to downgrade to GBoard 6.1.x Android 7.1.1 btw YouNex As you may have noticed, the screenshot above doesn't have rounded letter keys, which means version below 6.2 YouNex My GBoard version was 6.1.71 to be exact Tomáš Petrík Can you disable all of the top rows? No suggestions, no numbers, no G button, no themes shortcut... Just make it gone. I can do that in current version. If that option is gone, I will hesitate to update. I value screen estate. mattcoz Yes Tomáš Petrík Thanks! Igor Stanić How? mattcoz Oh, I see now that it still shows a bar with everything turned off in some apps. I tried it from the search bar and it wasn't there. Sorry about that. Tomáš Petrík Sadly, the answer is no. mattcoz Right, as I mentioned in my followup reply. Jaime Andres Salame Borja I wanted to search GIFs in Whatsapp? then i believe Whatsapp has to add the search engine... :( AbbyZFresh No gif support. Back to Swiftkey. Naxx ENVY It does support gifs... press the emoji button and its at the bottom,. the app has to support them too though senor_heisenberg Awesome. I'm so glad this was an update and not a separate app. Maxr1998 "Introducing Google Type, a smart keyboard with Google Assistant, tied to your phone number, and without SMS support." Vincent Don't give them ideas.. Clawz114 "The emoji panel was causing confusion with our users, so we have seperated this from the Gboard and Google Type to it's own dedicated emoji app, Gemoji." T4rd Hope they fix the the space bar cursor moving gesture, as it rarely works for my on my 6P. Sometimes if I try it for 20-30 secs it'll eventually remember I had that feature checked and start moving the cursor, so it's basically useless. Cory S Yeah, its a little stiff. I like the way it works on Chroma. Dehaha1 I agree, it's largely useless on my Nexus 5. It usually works on my second or third attempt, however at that point it would have been faster to just tap where I needed to go. On my iPad Mini 2 using GBoard it works much better, though sadly not as flexible as what is built into the default Apple keyboard. (Though I can't give up using GBoard, the gesture typing is too useful) mattcoz Are you holding and sliding or just doing a quick swipe? T4rd Tried it both ways several times. But I see now that if I do a quick swipe, it seems to work better, but still kinda inconsistent and awkward to use. Like your finger has to already be swiping before you touch the space bar, which doesn't feel right. So I think they need to tweak this gesture to allow you to do it while holding in on the space bar for a split second before swiping at least, esp since that doesn't have any other function associated with it (at least in my config). mattcoz No, you should NOT be doing a quick swipe. You hold it down and slide your finger, don't lift it until the cursor is where you want it. If that's not working, then there's something wrong. Martin I don't know if I'm just lucky, but I got it to work on the new Gboard on every single try so far. Previously it would always bring up the "Change Keyboard" menu instead, no matter how fast or slow I tried swiping. Simon I agree this function works much better with this new update. Berkay Did they add the two new keyboard themes that were on the pixel? Badouken Yes it has the blue color schemes for standard light and dark themes. Berkay I went ahead and got the APK because I was impatient, thank you anyway :) How do I use the GIF functionality? It doesn't seem to work anywhere. JSo Only works in apps that support it. Google Messenger, Hangouts and Allo. App developers apparently have to enable it themselves Badouken Mine didn't work at first but then randomly appeared after awhile. It appears when I clicked the smile icon at the bottom, it would then show a gif button next to it. Berkay Whenever I use the emoji search, it's so laggy... But google keyboard has been laggy for me since they introduced the update where they added all those new features like one handed mode. Tiuri Elvander I saw saw a video showing that the iOS version could send little screenshots of search results. I can't find a way to do that in this version of am I missing something?? Lazyboy0172 unfortunately doesn't look like we're missing anything. whenever I search for something it shows a "share" button but just inserts the text from the result as well as http link for the search. It's not the worst, but I'd much prefer to insert it as an image, especially in apps that support the official api for image insertion from keyboard. I mean it's already there with gif search, so why not make those shared search results as pretty in my text message as they are on the keyboard? Still very happy to be able to search from keyboard though, and be able to search emoji. Goodbye, Dango. Goodbye, Swiftkey. Please keep improving, GBoard. Paul_Werner I wasn't using Swiftkey but I was just like you regarding Dango. Glad to have it a part of the built in keyboard now saf1927 The multi language support works really well with two languages. Haven't added a third yet, but now Swift Key is really obsolete for me. Christopher Robert Does it allow for keyboard size scaling? How about better prediction? Themes? yep still not a good replacement for Swiftkeye. Tuck Choate Yes, yes, and yes. They're in the settings. Good thing Swiftkeye has good autocorrect. It'd be embarrassing to make a typo that contradicts your point online. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Multiple active languages". That look a long ass time to happen. br_hermon I want to like Gboard but it's lack of secondary key functions keeps me using SwiftKey. Abhilash Bingi What do you mean by "secondary key functions"? If you mean typing symbols by long pressing alphabets, you can do it in Google Keyboard. br_hermon Thanks the heads up! I never knew that. It's disabled by default. I had to go into settings to enable it. epsiblivion not a fan of all this rebranding to G products. must be new internal management on the apps. Ben G products... like what? Except this one? Perry Mason Gmail /s Todd I really hate that they did it to their email app. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. bikrame Hey guys, how do i add that numerical line above on keyboard. JSo Settings>Preferences>Toggle Number Row bikrame There is nothing like that JSo Then maybe it didn't update for you. bikrame I just downloaded. Vorastra https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a256e9e1393428c03b73ef88560b8959247cf4df2fb8b4664a215b5763527b9a.png bikrame https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cb2c9e011ee1cbea13883ec8e56c4afa707debc7c253dac399b7fa0841d64ae7.png Vorastra Super weird. You're missing the whole "Keys" section. bikrame May be its because i don't have stock Android ??!! Georgiy Alexandrov You downloaded it from Play Store? Then I suggest you check version number, it should be 6.0.65 bikrame ok now its going to sound super weird. I did download from play store and it says like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/599303b5bf88aff23f000101544e9f9f626e9d31d3a791cf557f08a8bef2ddb1.png Georgiy Alexandrov It's not really that weird, update probably not rolled out to you yet. You will get it a little bit later (or just download apk from link in article). And you should actually check app version through settings>apps>gboard (if you not seeing Gboard in apps try to look for Google Keyboard) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eff26cc1692310ac42f8878e975697259b70c46702b63ed7fd373a8d67597b.png Kieron Quinn It's on staged rollout and hasn't reached you yet, use the APK Vorastra I'm not using stock android. Using an LG G4. Georgiy Alexandrov Settings > preferences > number row Alex Guitar This is mucho bueno for my Spanglish! Frisi *muy :P Frisi Bye Swiftkey. It's me or Swiftkey caused more "typos" than any other keyboard? Of course, Swiftkey would correct them, but I type better using Google's Keyboard. Now with multi-lingo support I'm more than happy. motoridersd I've been using SwiftKey for a long, long time since I have always needed two languages. I have not been using Flow since I live by the swipe to delete gesture. I love the SwiftKey prediction of emoji, I use it ALL the time, and I am very used to the layout of the keyboard. Trying Gboard for the first time, it feels odd, but it's easy to type in. It doesn't seem to always introduce the period after hitting space bar twice. Swiping the backspace key to delete a word is cumbersome because the surface is very small, so I'm missing that already. There is no emoji prediction, but the search is nice. Unfortunately it doesn't know the latest emoji like bacon, avocado or facepalm, but once they are in the recent window, this can be less of an issue. The prediction does not work in the search box, which is a shame, because searching Google without it is a PITA. Hurricane Andrew The prediction also does not work in Chrome or the Facebook search field. Big oversight. motoridersd Yeah, I use that a lot with SwiftKey. A new Gboard update just came through, wonder if they're tweaking these things. Christian yup and for this thing i still use swiftkey, is really helpfull the prediction in chrome ;) Freek Smulders This is pretty big! #NotMyPresident Why would you want an advertising company logging all your keystrokes? PVL_93_RU I'd rather trust them than my own government to do the same #NotMyPresident LOL. Okay..... /rolleyes 7-down It's in the settings. You can disable sharing of what you type. #NotMyPresident And if you believe that Google respects that, I've got a bridge to sell you. 7-down Hopefully it's the Golden Gate Bridge. I really like the way it looks. http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ec/ec23811e3ebf097d66addd31391d2b84d094eb85cc37a9b74dec3475a722ca0c.jpg XerBlade Gboard settings > Advanced > Disable "Share snippets" (if it really bothers you that much) P.S. It never actually logs all your keystrokes, even with that enabled. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I see how that could be a concern. They should've filtered the keyboard the way it is in iOS, since that would probably give a lot of people more peace of mind. For example, on iOS, you can't enter your password using Gboard for this exact reason. Whenever you have to enter a password or pin number, it automatically reverts back to the default keyboard (which doesn't store information) to prevent anything getting leaked. But, all in all, this version is pretty cool too. XerBlade ...Seriously, this isn't sending your passwords back to Google. Apple did things that way in iOS to prevent possible malicious third party keyboard replacements from taking advantage of that (which IS a concern in Android: seriously, you probably shouldn't go around installing random keyboards from people you've never heard of). This keyboard, being not-a-malicious-app and all, simply never includes anything marked as a password field in the "snippets" it sometimes [optionally] collects as statistical data for use in improving the app. Knowledgeborn Allah At least that's what they tell you... I'm not trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but we don't really know what's happening behind the scenes. Google is an advertising company, and their job is to know as much about you as possible. Statistical data is one thing, but personal information is something different. Another thing that separates the Android version from the iOS version is that the Android version is tied to your Google account, while the one on iOS functions independently. That's how, on Android, they can share "learned words" across your Android devices. They can filter these through your devices because, since they're tied into your Google account, what you type (or at least some of it) goes through Google's servers. It's not anonymous data to just improve the app. It's data specifically about you, tied to your personal account. PVL_93_RU So when the G button is active - how do you switch languages? Do you just tap the same key? Is there a gesture like swipe the spacebar (swiftkey)? Frisi You don't have to now since it will automatically "change" as you type. PVL_93_RU I don't like that XerBlade The G button is unrelated. By default, it has multiple languages active simultaneously (so you just type and it intelligently figures out which language you're using as it goes). Or you can manually switch languages by long pressing spacebar (was already a thing in Google Keyboard). OR you can enable the dedicated language switch button in the settings (was also already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar (note the optional G button is on the left side of the suggestions pane, so again, completely unrelated). PVL_93_RU >OR you can enable the language switch button in the settings (was already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar Phew, thank god Kwetsima Maluleke Number row? Finally! Nuno G. Gboard?! What were these guys drinking?!? raazman The good stuff. tim242 Nothing good about this POS. raazman You're entitled to your own opinion. To me, the best keyboard out there just got better. tim242 Yeah, because a blank bar taking up screen real estate is so much better. I'm glad you like it. raazman What blank bar? tim242 The settings bar, above the keyboard. raazman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2569deb1397c93e3c918c8e97290dbd8c70fafb66fa9d5277b20236aa34124a6.png Huh? What exactly are you talking about? tim242 That bar where you have suggestions. I don't use suggestions. If you disable suggestions, the bar remains as a blank bar. They do this on about every other version. raazman Ah ok, makes sense. I use the suggestions so I never had the need to remove it. Aaron Sounds like a personal problem. tim242 You sound like a blocked problem : ) Aaron Doesn't matter. You can't stop anyone from replying. Wis Ciao Swiftkey, this is soooo good - everything I wanted. Thx, Google... David Prieto What's with the emoji search? Why doesn't it return any results? JSo Emoji search is working for me. ADofCLE The number row is probably the only new feature I am going to use lol mattcoz Dedicated number row? Dedicated number row?! DEDICATED NUMBER ROW!!! Andy Roid Yes, that's what it says in the article mattcoz It sure does! Adrianus AJ Nadeak #DEDICATEDNUMBERROW yka1988 OMG finally! I just switched back to SwiftKey after months and months of using the super snappy Google Keyboard. Those were exactly the things I was missing, and especially the language features made me switch back recently. well, byebye Swiftkey, welcome back Gboard :) El Jefe this is great so now I can do GIF kb in Hangouts but only lif not via SMS. In the Google Messenger app, I can do GIF kb with SMS... I'm running latest everything 7.1.1 ahhh Jordan L I'm not seeing the G button on my Pixel XL. anyone else? I enabled it in settings. rebooting now. I also don't see any text predictions. the whole top bar is missing. EDIT: reboot fixed. XerBlade Make sure you're in an app that supports text predictions. It won't show up if you are typing in the Google search bar, for example. Bewear Emoji search not working for me. It might be because my device is set in Spanish. Scros97 A mi sí que me funciona en castellano la búsqueda de emoji! Bewear Not for me :/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a56c197ba6b723f6ccc0ba473c4dc94277e9cac70a07f5146133052155fdc1f8.jpg Kieron Quinn I have the same issue, apparently you have to be on WiFi at least once for it to download. Shame I won't be until tomorrow. keithzg See this is when it pays to have two devices, so you set one to be a wifi hotspot, then trade off ;) Kieron Quinn My Nexus 5X IS a hotspot, because my flat wifi is broken Ashwin I've installed the app on wifi, have been on wifi the entire day and also tried the same with the new update and still the same error persists for me. What do I do? Cakefish Same but my language is English :( alessiolarva No way to search images directly from the keyboard? tim242 Great. From 41, to 72 MB running service, and laggy again uggggh Aaron Really? Not seeing any lag here. Maybe it's your phone? Would be the first time a Galaxy experienced lag... tim242 Yeah, because a Galaxy chooses which versions of Google Keyboard to lag on. *Eye roll JSo No lag here either. It's not the update. Rod Actually it's showing up as 100mb ish for me. Alex Feels like they finally fixed the Google keyboard lag. That is my only gripe with my Pixel XL ahtough that problem was also on the 6p). Cakefish "Data for emoji search is not available." What does that mean? Samson Don't know. It works for me. Cakefish What phone do you have and which Android version? I have Nougat 7.0. Samson Much appreciated update. I like it a lot! Rod This is the official Google keyboard. Samson It is now. And the problem still exists. So I had to go back to the older version of the official Google keyboard. Very disappointing. Dustin Mingo Swipe from backspace is gone :( Georgiy Alexandrov It still there, or did you mean something else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/09a329c7a63ed9bb2bcdeec4f5376ebdb3d98d40b75e3f7e2788bf488a681485.png Dustin Mingo Setting's gone for me. I'll clear data and report back Georgiy Alexandrov That's good to hear JSo No it's not Rod It isn't. Steve Will they ever enable its auto-corrections/auto-suggestions when searching? Rocket Does anyone know what happened to picture background? JSo You mean in themes? It's still there Rocket On the old Google Keyboard you could select a picture as the theme, but it looks like its gone now. JSo It's still there for me. I don't know why it's not working for you Rocket Did you do it as an update or as a new installation?? JSo I installed the apk right over my existing app Rocket Im gonna reinstall Google Keyboard (and brave the clunky LG Keyboard) and then update to GBoard Rocket Got it working by selecting a theme and then updating. Now it's an option. Georgiy Alexandrov Working for me on 7.1 and 6.0 but not on 4.4. Well, that's weird Rocket I'm on 5.1 so maybe that has something to do with it? Corey Kinard You sure? I press the arrow on the top left of the Keyboard, press the pallet, and the first theme option for me in Gboard is the "My images" one Edit: way too late! Igor Stanić how to disable popup toolbar when g is not enabled???...it just takes up space...everything is fantastic except this freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still better Igor Stanić How to disable suggestion row ...i dont use it so it is blank...terrible Georgiy Alexandrov You can't, as far as i know tim242 Yep, they always fuck something up. I had to revert back. Igor Stanić Me too Archenuh How to you revert back this damn cancer of an app? Dave Okay, wow. This app somehow fucked up my Pixel XL. I've installed it and it always freezed and didn't let me close the keyboard anymore. So I force restarted where it got stuck. I've hold down the power button again to force restart and when it booted up I was set back to Android 7.1 (had 7.1.1) and I can't access recent apps, can get into the quick settings, have different system settings (for example it vibrates when pressing home although I had it disabled) and it doesn't get data connection. What is this? JSo I really don't think a little keyboard app could cause all that. The most that could probably happen is that the keyboard may keep force closing if you installed the wrong version but I don't think it would do all the things you said happened. Dave I don't know either. But that's how it went. Everything was working fine and after I've installed the keyboard and it kept freezing and therefore covering up half my display although I was on the homescreen I force restarted where it got stuck. One again force starting brought me to that situation I am in now. Zach Mauch LOVE LOVE LOVE the dedicated number row. I would also like the option to add a "tab" button to the keyboard. suavemezie No emoji predictions? JSo What are these emoji predictions everyone is bringing up? Georgiy Alexandrov A SwiftKey (or other keyboard) feature, something like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/045c7a98611e38f08413474280cb41eb8fd78121f38eae7386543f5cc4490eb2.png JSo Was this something that was shown by Google or that the GBoard on iOS has? Just seems everyone is bringing this up all of a sudden. Georgiy Alexandrov Idk, but I dont remember Gboard having this on iOS. I guess it just a popular feature that many custom keyboards have. DubeBoom While Gboard feels much faster and more fluid, there are some things I just like about Swiftkey like the easy access to ? and !. But I'll try using Gboard for a few days to see if I get used to it. JSo Turn on "Long Press For Symbols" for easy access to those. Ashish Bogawat I have that option, but with Swiftkey you don't even need to long-press. Just swipe left on the '.' key. Seems small, but is super efficient once you get used to it. mattcoz Another quick method is to swipe from the symbol key, see if that works for you. Adrianus AJ Nadeak It's not as easy on a wide phone like the Nexus 6. mattcoz True Rod Decrease the long press delay, set it to 120ms. It'll make your life easier. Arshdeep Singh Saini It doesn't install 😢 Nathan J Aww. Google Keyboard's growing up. It was always my favorite keyboard on Android, even though it lacked some features of other keyboards. It was accurate which is what I liked. "Gboard" is a downgrade. On iOS, the Gboard autocorrect is just off the wall. Microsoft's Flow Keyboard (did y'all get that yet?) is better for trace typing, but it will not learn new words. No curse words, no proper names... gotta tap that out. So I deal with Gboard since it will learn... but not from its mistakes. It might be a limitation of iOS, but Gboard on iOS is vastly inferior to Google Keyboard on Android. Coming from someone who has used both extensively. Craig Nelson I have both myself and you're right the auto correct on Gboard IOS is not as good as IOS native keyboard but I will say that the Gboard on IOS seems slightly better than the one on android when it comes to the fluidity of finding a search result and using it. Max Not a second-copy-of-the-same-app? S**t what's happened Google? mrjayviper finally catch up to iOS. Thanks google. I'll be enjoying this on my note4 as I've been doing on the Air2 and 6s+ itsatrap Its good but still no better than Swiftkey. Not even close. jl2222 ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You can perform google search in Swiftkey? Find a gif without leaving the keyboard? itsatrap Those things are extras, keyboards are for typing. Swiftkey is still far better at it. On top of that, there is this annoying bug: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 Rod I agree. Swiftkey still has the lead. Azzy Fuck, only 3 languages at a time! Luckily SwiftKey can accommodate 5, just the number I need! Rod You speak 5 languages? Not bad! steb0ne Finally NERV I am still waiting for it to include those Asian languages so I don't need to download a worse separated one. xunknownx finally! been waiting for the google keyboard to have a dedicated number row. Albin Does it record keystrokes? Rod Of course. Machine learning is a thing. Umer Farooq It now also supports Urdu swiping and suggestions. Vincent Goh Asian languages? I need English, German, and Chinese. I don't need multi languages to include Chinese, but I don't want to switch keyboard app whenever I need to type Chinese. pfmiller Might be more realistic for them to add better English and other Latin alphabet language support to the Pinyin keyboard. I can understand them not wanting to clutter up their main keyboard with various input methods. Ramiro Fernandez I noticed something, don't know if it's new to this version but pretty sure it is. The keyboard will sometimes now correct *back* one word if the next word you type changes what it would predict. So I typed "I'm feeling" but when I typed "I'm" it detected it as "on". Then after typing "feeling" it changed the "on" to "I'm". Gave me options for the two word suggestion too (see screenshot). Doesn't always happen, I guess it depends on how close I was with my gliding and how confident it was with the original prediction. I've never seen this before, but it's really clever. I wish it would take context into account better when suggesting words in general. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f788aeb53d108efe429fbde31f0cead3ef3ecba862432200ee25bd8e1eecf969.png Rod Yeah, I noticed it yersterday whilst replying to a Reddit comment. itsatrap Do you guys have this problem: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/sxhRXvLfILk WesleySmalls Have they learned nothing from the IE6 toolbars? benjammin03 I am waiting for the google keyboard to have the swipe left to delete the last word. After using it on Swiftkey, it's impossible to use a keyboard without it. Portgas D. Ace Gboard does have this option. benjammin03 I think I tried this before, but I couldn't get used to having to start at the delete key. I'm used to being able to swipe left from anywhere. I forgot about it though, so I'm going to give it another shot since this is the only reason I still use Swiftkey. Thanks! Portgas D. Ace I used Swiftkey in the past but never gestures. So I had no idea it works differently there. Rod In Gboard, you'll need to swipe from the backspace key. But, it's more effective, as you can delete a 10,000 word text all at once. Portgas D. Ace https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/751b4dcb558130893fe4db757a19aa363e250b3b3f2f347889f55783a469ef98.png Rod Swipe horizontally from the backspace key, and you can even delete the whole text at once. Faheem Ahmed not available in 4.2+ Promethean Add Swypes select all/copy/cut/paste gestures and I'm sold, I use them a lot more than I thought and missed them from other keyboards. Jack Sparrow I find it very buggy. It shows only one result. No horizontal scrolling like on iOS. And the funny thing is, if you search for "gboard", it returns the result for slash keyboard! Is it just me or is everyone facing the issue? Rod What do you mean, horizontal scrolling? Savage Alien "Emoji have bright halo effect around them" Yeah, whose bright idea was this? It doesn't look very pretty. QeeYou i know right 😂, looks very bad in bright themes'. neonix One more new feature I noticed: you can now edit the current theme. I believe previously, you couldn't make changes once the image was set. Dobriy Her Still not available in Turkish play store keithzg Oddly enough, the Play Store is still reporting this to me as Google Keyboard, but showing the version to be 6.mumble, while if I go into Settings -> Languages & Input -> Virtual Keyboards I see Gboard. Portgas D. Ace I get it listed as Gboard the Google keyboard in the updates list and as Google keyboard in the play store listing. dylan-m So, anyone else finding the emoji keyboard uniquely irritating now? They're wasting a ridiculous amount of vertical space, they have *two rows* of tabs, and the bottom row of tabs appears where the space bar is (while the emoji key is right beside the comma key). I frequently end up looking at the plain text smileys keyboard because I happen to miss the comma key while I'm typing. (They probably shifted the keys over by a few pixels again). That would have been fine with the old keyboard because the key to go back was in the exact same place. Now you have to pause and look for it because *the entire layout suddenly changes*. Also, they only have three tiny squashed little rows for the actual emoji, which is as many rows as they have for chrome. It's completely terrible. It would not be hard to flip that first row of tabs to the top, squeeze the search button beside them (because it doesn't need to be a text box and they can probably kill a category or two), and maintain a consistent layout for the bottom row of keys. Anyway, this is the second time in six months they have made significant changes to the keyboard layout, unexpectedly screwing with peoples' muscle memory. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by Google any more, but, it's pretty bad form. Ashwin "Data for emoji search is not available" error when tryed to search emoji...Anyone else with the same error?? Even updated to 6.0.68 (first update after Gboard 6.0.65)...Still no luck...Guys, someone please help!! please Does anyone know how the f I can disable the stupid toolbar? I HATE it, it just takes up space and I'll never use it. Any drastic measure to get rid of it works for me. Archenuh I really need this as well. What the fuck is wrong with them adding that fucking stupid toolbar above the keyboard and not letting us DISABLE it?! please how to disable toolbar LOL How does active languages work? I don't get it Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms... LOL So it only works with Latin alphabet? Rod No, those were examples. The app description on Play Store says it covers over 120 languages. LOL But I cant just write a sentence in English and then throw a word from a different language. To write anything in different language I MUST switch keyboard to that language in order to use that alphabet Rod I have English and Brazilian portuguese set, and I can start a sentence in portuguese, throw in some english words and finish in portuguese, and it will auto-correct all the words automatically. I don't need to tinker with anything at all. Just like in Swiftkey. LOL That's because Brazilian uses Latin alphabet. Its impossible to type a word in a different language if it's not Latin Rod Oh, I never tried another language that doesn't use latim alphabet. My bad. Scorpiax7 How does the "multiple active languages" thing works? i need an explanation, please -.- <3 Dmytro Gulivatyy If you have multiple similar languages installed you can type in both without switching and it will understand which one you meant. It should display the languages that are used on the spacebar key below. Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms. Dmytro Gulivatyy Does anyone know why we're getting it so late? I remember people protecting Google not releasing it on Android because we had G Now on tap but I'm confused now. Mako g now on tap is somewhat hidden in Pixels, so this is a good alternative Dmytro Gulivatyy I know and I agree, but why hold out for months before finally releasing it here kinda saying "Hey, you guys can have it too, don't worry we haven't forgotten." Just feels like it. Mako yeah, I really don't know why it took so long Dmytro Gulivatyy Less resources? Harder to code for? I mean it's their OS. Maybe they didn't care enough because it's easier to search for something with the search bar always accessible, GNow on tap here, and they weren't in such a hurry. But now they come out saying this is a better way. Sometimes i cant understand their behavior. pfmiller Android already has plenty of easy ways to access Google search, so it probably wasn't a big priority. Mwikarago Christian Why doesn't auto suggestion work in chrome search bar? Any idea? Dmytro Gulivatyy It's always been like that. I don't know for sure if i'm right but i think it's because they don't want to mess up your query because it's a browser address field. Same goes for the Google search bar. They think you will want full control over what you're typing because it can get technical, unlike the usual chats you have with people in chat apps. It sometimes offers predictions itself but not always. One of the reasons i'm still with SwiftKey. Mwikarago Christian That's a weird decision on their part. The only time I need autocorrection is in the address /search bar as I usually search using recurring words. That's also the reason I'll stick with SwiftKey Dmytro Gulivatyy Yes, it's been discussed times and times again and even listed as a bug https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 but i personally don't think it's one, they would've fixed it a long time ago. For what its worth i don't understand their reasoning either, you can still type and have it write what you meant and not autocorrect it but i also have other reasons to stick with SwiftKey(one being its better at autocorrecting something when GBoard thinks it was just gibberish and has no clue) but it's getting better and has its charm too. marclee Yes it has been always like this.. I kind of understand why Google wants autocorrect disabled in chrome address bar (not agree tho), I just can't understand it is disabled in Google search bar and YouTube..... Rod That's disabled in the app. Someone on Reddit revealed the code. Pedro Diego Fernández It seems I'm the only one having problems with the keyboard...sometimes I glide I can see it's writing the word I want but when I finish it just adds a letter... and the multiple active languages is too funky to use... had to switch back to aosp :( Navin Govindani Not a big fan of the initial release as it has many problems with Spanish, doesn't suggest anything with "ñ", hell it even tries to autocorrect anything I type with it, not to mention, the occasional lag, I understand it's an initial release but please get your shit together team! MikeOxlong The versions available on apkmirror are old (6.0.65). I currently have 6.0.69 on my 6p and pixel XL direct from the play store... Rod Contact Artem, maybe you can share your apk with them? SyCoREAPER Why does the Google Keyboard fdiffer from the AOSP one? Rod AOSP version is outdated and missing the newer features. It's a bare-bones version. SyCoREAPER Aosp in my opinion is functionally superior with the long press symbols for every key Rod That's also present in Gboard. SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it. pfmiller That's an option in Gboard SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it s427 I think I'll make the switch from Swype to Gboard for good now. The only thing still missing IMO are the gesture shortcuts (copy, cut, paste, select all, change capitalization), which are super useful in Swype. So, GOOGLE IF YOU'RE LISTENING YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO! dk mke That and the exclamation and question mark short cuts as well. By far the best features of any keyboard IMO. It's why I keep going back. Rod As a long-time Swiftkey user, I deeply miss the punctuation auto-spacing. drcaveman Anyone else having the GBoard just randomly stop accepting input? I fix it by hiding and clicking the text input box again. Seems to happen more frequently in messaging apps. freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still way better than this new Google keyboard. First of all, SwiftKey is better with word predictions. Secondly, SwiftKey has emoji predictions and Google keyboard does not. And lastly, the SwiftKey emoji list of emojis scrolls down📜 very smooth and fast. But instead in the Google Keyboard that same emoji list scrolls through multiple horizontal pages instead. It's very slow and takes forever if you are texting. Mace Moneta Still no control, alt or tab key (even just the option in advanced setting would be nice), which is annoying for those of us that ssh into systems. marrecar Ok I updated the app this morning and it completely broke it. No words show up on prediction bar, double space doesn't add a dot, can't delete by swiping to the left, can't move the cursor by swiping the spacebar. Plus the emoji menu looks awful. Does anyone have the same problem? I tried deleting data first, didn't work, then I replaced it with stock version, updated and still the same. obk88 very intrigued by gboard used it for 5 days went back to swiftkey...typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying, gliding isnt as smooth and better emoji experience on swiftkey...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure Christian Wagner Jr Still too large of a keyboard. I have a Nexus 6P and with it on its smallest setting, the keyboard and the box above it take up just under half my screen! SE.Quence so what? just resize it in settings Christian Wagner Jr I did. Its set to the smallest setting. Went thru all the settings as well. If they only gave the option to make it smaller by one or 2 more sizes, I would dump swiftkey for this no problem. Not all of us have donut fingers and need keys THAT large SE.Quence Yep, I can agree that some of other keyboards can be smaller when set to smallest size. But setting GKB to lowest height is pretty decent IMO. Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Can u help me with this? Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature sachouba It only took Google 3 years to add some features available on Samsung's keyboard and SwiftKey. And Google fans sound astonished... patrick yes i had the numbers row on my S4 stock samsung keyboard. but as far as autocorrection, i always found Google keyboard to be more accurate. SE.Quence Testing new GBoard on my 2 Nexus devices. Both running 7.1.1. Dictionary sync doesnt work even when account is set and sync was forced manually. By some reason, GBoard is not presented in Google sync settings (Accounts - Google) but IDK whether it should be here. Who else is facing this? Đức Thành I've been using the APK since a few days ago and autocorrection is still as horrible as ever, especially for Vietnamese. There's no options to set the aggressiveness level of autocorrection, and it's a pain in the neck to hit backspace multiple times for every sentence I type just to go back and fix the incorrectly autocorrected words. Not to mention Gboard now tries to autocorrects whole compound words and phrases, and every time I want to say: "Yo Google keyboard, I appreciate the effort but honestly you are not doing that well since you don't know the language or how I type that well, and your ultra aggressiveness in helping me is creating more trouble than it solves, so could you stop?" In the end just now I had to turn off autocorrection altogether, and now I have to face the problem of not having autocorrection for either language. I wish there were some middle grounds, but Google is too stubbornly extreme in its ways sometimes. Sigh. dhamp2g Vietnamese? ?? Honestly dude, English only ..... LMAO it corrects English well 😂😂 Đức Thành I'm afraid I don't fully comprehend what you mean. Yes it autocorrects English very well, but it has also started supporting autocorrection for Vietnamese since Google Keyboard 5.0, and that's my native language so there's nothing wrong with using that, and since the app itself officially supports the language... Arrgh forget it, you won't get it anyway. dhamp2g I understand , I was just saying all us english speaking folk only car about english problems LMAO :) mizrulez I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't turn off the keypress pop-up in the latest update. I tried deleting data, but the option is still not there. I find the popups extremely annoying. 😏 ggggg Something extraordinary happened. Google updated Google Keyboard instead of creating another keyboard App. mwolverine i wish it would show suggestions when searching in google apps. I usually end up going back to swype because of this. Usman Nagi Only reason I am not upgrading is that I miss the no key delay feature. Is there any way to enable in this current build? It slows my typing down and I only type better with popups. Itchy_Robot Why don't they just put Google Assistant into this keyboard? Renan At least that hideous G button is optional tigerberry Oh hey, finally there's gesture typing for Hungarian! It only took... well, how many years? Too many, considering that other keyboards, even OEM keyboards have been able to do it since ages. And lemme check... yep, still no gesture typing for Japanese in QUERTY mode. Come on Google, even Huawei's keyboard can do it! (I miss the Xperia keyboard. :( I wish it was available for non-Sony phones...) Gwaur I wish there was a way to completely hide the extra row where that G icon is. I found a setting for hiding the icon but the row stayed. It's a goddamn waste of space for someone who's not gonna use it. Fahad Ahmed Why there's no Chinese language included??? That's disappointing. Természetjáró Gayboard. Sorry, I'll show myself out... Patel Nisha I would be happy with a backspace key! Or better still, when using a stylus, thus knowing I went to each letter precisely when swaping, the damn thing would input my entry versus some substitute word! Marco Reali I love GBOARD but two things are very very frustrating: 1. There is no suggestion bar when typing in Chrome. 2. The language switch takes to long to recognise which language I'm typing. I wish they woul reinstate the button for those who want that. I switch language pretty often and I find it horrible to have to re-type words over and over before it's in the right language. WestIndiesKING anyone else getting a little bit of lag when you first start it up after a while of not pulling up the keyboard? I am getting 1-3 seconds of lag before it starts only if i havent used it in a while, after that it flies. Pixel XL 128gb Daddyo Gordon Am I the only one who feels the google keyboard has gotten bloated and too big? There should be an option to keep it at one language, as pioneered by monolingual on the mac (gets rid of a couple Gb of unused languages that waste storage).

Online services and Internet users alike face the same challenge—trying to discern between what is a legitimate news story and one that is outright false (or a satire). It is not always easy. According to Google, thousands of new articles are published online every minute. To help distinguish fact from fiction, Google is expanding the availability of its Fact Checking tool to search. Google first introduced its Fact Check tool last October ahead of election day. What it did was allow publishers to show a "Fact Check" tag in Google News for news stories that have been vetted. Readers could be assured that any story accompanied by the tag was legitimate, as the information in the article would have been fact checked by news publishers and fact-checking organizations alike in order to have the tag. That same tag is now being injected globally into Google's search engine results, and is available in all language. "For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page. The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim," Google stated in a blog post. To be clear, this will not be available for every search. Google warns that there may also be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions. In that respect, this is not a cure-all to the problem of fake news. However, this is a step in the right direction. Internet users should view this as a tool to help make an informed judgement on an article. "Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree. As we make fact checks more visible in Search results, we believe people will have an easier time reviewing and assessing these fact checks, and making their own informed opinions," Google added. Publishers who want to participate must use the Schema.org ClaimrReview markup on the specific pages where they fact check public statements. There is also a "Share the Facts" widget available to publishers that was developed by the Duke University Reporters Lab and Jigsaw.

Google rolling out a new look for sign-in, deprecating old methods Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:30am PDTApr 7, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 159 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares244 Development Google News Starting on April 10th Google plans on pushing out an update to the sign-in page for Google accounts. This change is meant to further unify the sign-in process across your various devices. Although the news was posted to the G Suite Developers blog, we do fully expect this change to affect all Google accounts on all browsers, mobile browsers, and iOS apps (Android apps should not be affected). Google's SSO will also see additional changes beyond the purely cosmetic, as a new permissions grant redirect will be added to the login process, and permissions requested by a site or service will be more explicitly stated. The privacy-conscious will be excited to hear that Google is making such an effort to ensure a greater awareness on the part of users when it comes to privacy and consent in the use of third party services. Unfortunately, the permission request pane will no longer list what Google considers to be "standard" permission requests, presumably including basic account information. At least Google is making some effort to increase privacy awareness during login, even going so far as to increase the burden of responsibility for that privacy on developers by requiring contact information to be listed at a link on the permissions page. These aren't the only changes to login Google will be making. The use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe after April 20th, so if you are a developer relying on a webview redirect for OAuth to grant permissions you should consider changing to the official methods very soon before it breaks. Even some large companies like Airbnb and Pocket still haven't updated to the new methods, so it's worth taking a look. The rollout for the new sign-in is expected to be quite extended, potentially requiring more than two weeks for full visibility, so don't be surprised if you don't notice any changes to your sign-in process for a while. Most people probably won't notice much of a change beyond the cosmetic, anyway (although, our readers certainly aren't most people).

Thanks. Matt I'm sure this was first hinted at during the last Google IO... or possibly earlier. Every time I had to login since hearing that announcement I lost my shit wondering what was taking so long. Josh Crumley Of all the companies out there taking our personal data and using it for profit, Google is by far the least secretive about it. I'm glad they're making the permissions more detailed. Pixelexel I don't trust any company with my data other than Google. Kanoosh i don't even really trust google , but they are the least worst imo so i i go with them. :) HSidhu Google won't give your data to anyone, your Data is their power. Kanoosh never assume just because someone tells you something , that it is true.. i still hold plenty of caution with google as should everyone else.. no tin foil hats here, just reality of things... but i do hold them in higher regard for my personal data then any others , just always good to be safe. catalysto It's not just because "someone said so". It's because if Google was ever caught actually selling/releasing user data, they'd be completely screwed. Their entire business model depends on them keeping your data private.

Summerer The 'keep me logged in' button will be removed and instead you will always stay logged in until you explicitly logout in a browser. Seems kinda insecure or at least intransparent for the average user Devin Rodriguez Honestly it's never been very effective for me anyway. Every few days I found myself having to re-enter my password and sometimes even my 2FA regardless of whether I checked the box or not. Rabia Atta they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Devin Rodriguez What? Indefinite Implosion they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Ryne Hager I agree, I think he was fairly clear on that point. Devin Rodriguez Oh, okay. abc But which is the fastyest? BC This is interesting and I do like the the fact that the permissions are highlighted more than they were before. This is a good thing indeed! Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe Thank god. I absolutely hate apps that do that for Google / Facebook / Twitter permission request. If the first party app is installed, popup permission request screen on those apps. Don't load a webview asking me to login with email, password, 2FA. I wish FB and Twitter will also do what Google is doing now. Drunk Squirrel Like how titanium backup opens a webview of Google sign in in order to backup to Google drive, as opposed to other apps which show up a single pop-up,, correct Ryne Hager Right? They've got libraries for that, why make me enter my information again on a device I'm already logged in on? Imagine all the time that could have been saved. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I didn't even mention "save this new browser?" screen and "logged in from a new machine" emails that those webview logins cause. I uninstall any app that uses that, no matter how good the app otherwise is. HSidhu hello @ryne Hager aka new guy :) Ryne Hager Yo! Josh Crumley Welcome to the club!

According to The Guardian, the department is accusing the tech giant of drastically underpaying its female employees, even beyond the typical gender pay gap in the tech sector. This data has come to light as part of the department’s lawsuit against Google, which has been refusing to turn over salary data to prove its compliance with equal-pay labor laws. In light of Google’s refusal, the department has requested that the government cancel its contracts with the company and block them from future government work. DOL regional director Janette Wipper testified, “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.” Another DOL employee told The Guardian Friday, “The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters … The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.” The Guardian reports: Wipper said the department found pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and said officials needed earlier compensation data to evaluate the root of the problem and needed to be able to confidentially interview employees. “We want to understand what’s causing the disparity,” she said. A Google spokesperson told The Atlantic, “We vehemently disagree with Ms Wipper’s claim. Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DOL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” Google tweeted on Equal Pay Day that the company has “closed the gender pay gay globally, and also provide[s] equal pay across races in the U.S., according to our annual compensation analysis. At our re:Work site, we’re sharing some of the lessons we’ve learned to help other businesses close the pay gap.” Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 102 Plus 1 on G+ 151 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares310 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !fe112c: On monday I got a great new mclaren f1 from having earned $12778 this last four weeks.. 3 to 5 hours of work a day... Weekly paychecks... Bonus opportunities...Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. It sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it !fe112c: ➽➽ ➽➽➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs402ShopSites/GetPaid$97/Hour... ★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫:::!fe112c:....,.... icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

SHARES The median home price in Mountain View, Calif., within two miles of Google's headquarters, is just over $1.3 million, reports the real estate company Estately. Since Google has 21 offices around the country, though, there are plenty of cheaper places an engineer could choose to work for the tech giant. "In fact," Estately finds, "in many cities one could actually buy multiple homes for the same price." If an engineer could shift to the office in Ann Arbor, Mich., for example — assuming such a move is possible — she could buy nearly five houses there for the amount she would have to spend on one in Mountain View. In Atlanta, she could afford about four and in Pittsburgh, over three. Read on for the site's full report. "How many homes could one buy for the price of a Mountain View, California, home? Ann Arbor, MI—4.7 homes Atlanta, GA—3.9 homes Pittsburgh, PA—3.7 homes Austin, TX—3.3 homes Chapel Hill, NC—3.1 homes Reston, VA—3.0 homes Chicago, IL—2.7 homes Boulder, CO—2.3 homes Birmingham, AL—2.1 homes Washington, DC—2.0 homes Seattle, WA—1.9 homes Cambridge, MA—1.7 homes Irvine, CA—1.6 homes Playa Vista, CA—1.4 homes San Bruno, CA—1.3 homes San Francisco, CA—1.2 homes Sunnyvale, CA—1.2 homes Kirkland, WA—1.2 homes New York City, NY—1.0 homes Los Angeles, CA—0.8 homes" Google also has offices around the world in Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East where your money could go even further. show chapters Here's what $1.3 million can buy you in real estate in the U.S.'s biggest metropolitan areas    Tuesday, 4 Apr 2017 | 10:31 AM ET | 01:19 Ester BloomSenior Editor, CNBC Make It Primetime Shows Watch full episodes | TV schedule To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM.

More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol.

Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it.

I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank.

Rudresh Please share some for the N7 2013 too, pretty please! R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

In order to curb the propagation of fake news online, Google will be introducing a new ‘Fact Check’ tag to its search results. The label will identify article that includes information fact checked by news publishers and fact-checking organisations.   The search giant states that after assessing feedback from both users and publishers, the company is now making the Fact Check label in Google News available everywhere, and expanding it into Search globally in all languages.   So, for example, when you search some news on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page. The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim.   “This information won’t be available for every search result, and there may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions. These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgements. Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree. As we make fact checks more visible in Search results, we believe people will have an easier time reviewing and assessing these fact checks and making their own informed opinions,” the company said in blog post.   Google Google News Google Fact Check fake news information applications First Published : Saturday, April 08, 2017 - 18:23 Similar News YouTube revamps its ad strategy to keep a check on content theft Android O on the cards but Android Nougat's adoption rates less than 5 percent Google confirms a Pixel 2 in the pipeline Google tunes up for the music market in India .

And now it seems the company is looking to push further into the world of virtual reality, as it has just hired former Vive app developer, Logan Olson. Olson is the man behind VR music creation tool SoundStage, which proved a hit when it came out of Early Access on Steam last month, and is also now available for the Oculus Rift. Related: HTC Vive A Google spokesperson told The Verge: “We’re excited to welcome Logan to the Google VR team. As a leader in thinking about creating in VR with his app SoundStage, we’re really inspired by what he’s built and for the potential for VR and creativity.“ Google reportedly also said it plans to build on what Olson learned for both current and future projects, though just what the company has in-store for the developer remains unclear at this point. The Daydream View While the launch of the Daydream View headset late last year suggested Google was still heavily invested in developing VR experiences, there's not been much news since. The Pixel and Pixel XL phones, which launched alongside the Daydream View, were initially the only phones to support the Daydream platform, and only a handful of other devices, such as the Moto Z, have come with Daydream compatibility since. Last year, VP of VR at Google Clay Bavor told the Wall Street Journal “We predict that as much energy and talk and hype there is around VR right now, it’s going to be a slower ramp than people appreciate. Google appointed Bavor as VP of its VR division in January 2016, and it seems that it's still looking to build its VR team, even if the public will be as slow to jump onboard the VR bandwagon as Bavor suggests.

A US Department of Labor official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. 'We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,' Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. 'Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,' Google said in its statement. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the US government's claim that it engages in discriminatory compensation practices against female employees. The company's Mountain View, California, headquarters is seen in the above stock image Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men.  Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far.

Share this article Share For instance, only 19 percent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labor Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records.  Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts.  Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

People who search for a topic in Google’s main search engine or the Google News section will see a conclusion such as “mostly true” or “false” next to stories that have been fact checked. Google has been working with more than 100 news organizations and fact-checking groups , including The Associated Press, the BBC and NPR. Their conclusions will appear in search results as long as they meet certain formatting criteria for automation. Google said only a few of those organizations, including PolitiFact and Snopes.com, have already met those requirements; The Washington Post also says it complies. Google said it expects the ranks of compliant organizations to grow following Friday’s announcement. Not all news stories will be fact checked. Multiple organizations may reach different conclusions; Google will show those separately. Still unanswered is whether these fact-check analyses will sway people who are already prone to believe false reports because they confirm preconceived notions. Glenn Kessler, who writes “The Fact Checker” column at The Washington Post, said in an email that Google’s efforts should at least “make it easier for people around the world to obtain information that counters the spin by politicians and political advocacy groups, as well as purveyors of ‘fake news.”’ He added that “over time, I expect that people increasingly will want to read a fact-check on a controversial issue or statement, even if the report conflicts with their political leanings.” Google started offering fact check tags in the U.S. and the U.K. in October and expanded the program to a handful of other countries in the subsequent months. Now the program is open to the rest of the world and to all languages. False news and misinformation, often masquerading as trustworthy news that spreads on social media, has gained attention since the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Google’s announcement comes a day after Facebook launched a resource to help users spot false news and misleading information that spreads on its service. The resource is basically a notification that pops up for a few days. Clicking on it takes people to tips and other information on how to spot false news and what to do about it.     Tags: google, people, false, organizations, search, stories, Other stories from today: After weak jobs report and Syria strikes, stocks stand still Google expands fact checking in news searches U.S. regulators accuse Google of underpaying female workers     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   How much do you approve of the job performance of President Trump?

Google started offering fact check tags in the U.S. and the U.K. in October and expanded the program to a handful of other countries in the subsequent months. Now the program is open to the rest of the world and to all languages. False news and misinformation, often masquerading as trustworthy news that spreads on social media, has gained attention since the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Google's announcement comes a day after Facebook launched a resource to help users spot false news and misleading information that spreads on its service. The resource is basically a notification that pops up for a few days. Clicking on it takes people to tips and other information on how to spot false news and what to do about it.

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. 1. Introduction Google has explained here how to verify if a given IP address belongs to Googlebot. So instead of hard-coding all the IPs which might change eventually, Google has suggested doing a DNS lookup using a host command on Linux. The steps suggested in the article are: Reverse DNS lookup using the IP to get the domain name. Check if the domain name contains googlebot.com or google.com. The types of bots and their names can be found here. Forward DNS lookup using the domain name obtained in step 1 to get the IP and verify that this IP is same as the IP you initially started with. 2. Implementation Approach And I wanted to check if the IPs ( I had around 45) belonged to google bot. One option was to run host for each of the IPs, as suggested in the above steps, but this was practically not possible and if possible it would be time-consuming. So I came up with a simple shell script to do this job. Reverse DNS lookup to get the domain name: #hostName is the complete domain name
hostName = host $line | cut -d" " -f 5 So a sample response of host command would be:  246.66.249.66.in-addr.arpadomain name pointer crawl-66-249-66-246.googlebot.comAnd we can extract the domain name using the cut command as shown above. This gives us: hostName = crawl-66-249-66-246.googlebot.com . Forward DNS lookup to get the IP: hostIp=host $hostName | cut -d" " -f 4 A sample response to the host command, in this case, would be: crawl-66-249-66-246.googlebot.com has address 66.249.66.246. And we extract the IP using the cut command shown above which gives us the  hostIp = 66.249.66.246 . Verify the domain name to contain the Googlebot and the IP obtained in step 2 is the same as the IP we started with in step 1: if [ $line == $hostIp ] && [ $domainName == "googlebot.com" ]
then
    echo "Googlebot: $hostIp -> $hostName"
fi 3. Complete Shell Script Let the IPs be in the file googlebots, for example, and let us add these IPs: 66.249.66.246
66.249.66.97
66.249.64.12 The shell script is given below: #!/bin/sh
file="googlebots"
while read -r line
do
    hostName=`host $line | cut -d" " -f 5`
    domainName=`echo $hostName | cut -d"." -f2,3`
    #echo $domainName
    #echo "$hostName"
    hostIp=`host $hostName | cut -d" " -f 4`
    #echo "$hostIp"
    if [ $line == $hostIp ] && [ $domainName == "googlebot.com" ]
    then
        echo "Googlebot: $hostIp -> $hostName"
    fi

(AP Photo/Santa Cruz Sentinel, Shmuel Thaler, File) SAN FRANCISCO — Federal immigration officials are deporting a California prostitute to Canada after she completed a jail sentence for involuntary manslaughter for giving a fatal heroin shot to a Google executive she was entertaining aboard his yacht. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman said Friday that Alix Tichelman's deportation was ordered by a judge because of her felony convictions connected to the accidental overdose death of Forrest Hayes in November 2013. Immigration agents arrested her after she finished her jail sentence in Santa Cruz County on March 29. Police say a surveillance video at the harbor showed Tichelman's at first panicking and trying to revive Hayes. Then it shows her casually step over Hayes' body, finish a glass of wine and lower a blind before leaving the yacht.

A DoL official shed some light on the agency’s allegations at a court hearing in San Francisco. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified on Friday, according to the Guardian. Read more Dead on arrival? Google’s fake news fact-checkers mired in bias, controversy She said the agency found pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries, adding that to fully assess the problem, officials needed earlier compensation data as well as opportunities to interview employees in person. “We want to understand what’s causing the disparity,” she said. Regional solicitor for the DoL Janet Herold told the newspaper that although the investigation is not yet over, the department has already received “compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry,” Herold noted. Google said it disagreed with the charges, saying the DoL’s allegations are evidence-free. “We vehemently disagree with Ms Whipper’s claim,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.”  Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today → https://t.co/KTuGTJMV16pic.twitter.com/rBciSK21uF— Google (@Google) 4 апреля 2017 г. Google attorney Lisa Barnett Sween testified that the DoL’s request constituted a “fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review” and was an unconstitutional violation of the company’s fourth amendment right to protection from unreasonable searches. “For some reason or another, Google wants to hide the pay-related information,” DoL attorney Marc Pilotin said, as cited by the Guardian. The labor department asked the court to cancel all of the company’s federal contracts and block future business with the government if it continues refusing to comply with the audit, the Guardian reported. Read more What are you on? Google boss grilled over taxes, but doesn’t know his own salary In January this year, the DoL filed a lawsuit against Google, seeking to force the company to provide salary data to the government. According to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), Google failed to submit the data about the company’s equal opportunity program in September 2015. Google, a federal contractor, is required to allow the agency to inspect and copy records and information regarding its compliance with equal opportunity laws. A Google spokesperson told Reuters, however, that over the last year, the company provided hundreds of thousands of records to comply with the OFCCP’s audit.         “However, the handful of OFCCP requests that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we've made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail,” the spokesperson said. In 2016, Google reported that women made up 31 percent of its overall workforce. In January, the DoL filed a lawsuit against another tech giant, Oracle, claiming it paid white male employees more than other workers and favored Asian job applicants. The agency said Oracle refused to provide relevant information about its pay practices. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger refuted the claims as “politically motivated,” adding that its employment decisions were only based on merit and experience.

Not only is Facebook battling the menace in all front, Google too is not giving it a breathing space. On Friday, Google added fact checking tag to Search and News. This is a game changer because new considered to be fake will now be tagged as such to warn users of the implication of clicking it. “After assessing feedback from both users and publishers, we’re making the Fact Check label in Google News available everywhere, and expanding it into Search globally in all languages. For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page. The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim.” Justin Kosslyn, Product Manager and Cong You, Research Scientist at Google said on Friday. Google said the tag won’t be displayed or added to every search result. The company also said tags on search results may differ, especially in occasions when different publishers carried out the check—and in such cases, results or conclusions reached may be different. Google itself will not be responsible for checking the facts behind the search results, but is collaborating with others to carry out the checks. The goal of the check is to help you make informed decisions. You will also be able to make your informed decision as the search engine giant continue to make the checks visible. If you are a publisher and want to use or be included in the feature, Google said “you must be using the Schema.org ClaimReview markup on the specific pages where they fact check public statements.” Another option is that you can use Share the Facts widget developed by the Duke University Reporters Lab and Jigsaw. However, you only qualify to use the latter option if you are regarded as an authoritative source of information—and this is based on algorithm. Other conditions are highlighted by Google in a blog post on Friday. Google added Fact Checking labels to its popular news service last October prior to the US Presidential election won by President Trump. This came on the heels of various controversial news items that got many users confused and influenced their choice of candidates before and during the election. Articles containing fact checks will be determined by Google’s algorithm using the schema.org ClaimReview system. The algorithm will also look for sites/blogs that adhere to commonly laid down criteria for fact checks. Google began adding labels to its articles seven years ago to make it easier for readers to access different categories of content. Users can already access and identify content on the news service based on “Local Source,” “Highly Cited,” “Opinion” “Trending,” “In Depth” and “Related.” Content is also provided to readers by category to make using the service a stroll in the park.

Something was amiss; the beer wasn’t fermenting at the usual temperature. Luckily, a software system triggered a warning and he fixed the problem. "We would have had to dump an entire batch," the brewmaster said. When beer is your bottom line, that's a calamity. Share this story File image The software that spotted the temperature anomaly is from Microsoft Corp. and it's a new type that uses a powerful form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. What makes it potentially revolutionary is that Deschutes rented the tool over the internet from Microsoft's cloud-computing service.  Day to day, Deschutes uses the system to decide when to stop one part of the brewing process and begin another, saving time while producing better beer, the company says. The Bend, Oregon-based brewer is among a growing number of enterprises using new combinations of AI tools and cloud services from Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet’s Google. C-SPAN is using Amazon image-recognition to automatically identify who is in the government TV programs it broadcasts. Insurance company USAA is planning to use similar technology from Google to assess damage from car accidents and floods without sending in human insurance adjusters. The American Heart Association is using Amazon voice recognition to power a chat bot registering people for a charity walk in June. AI software used to require thousands of processors and lots of power, so only the largest technology companies and research universities could afford to use it. An early Google system cost more than $1 million and used about 1 000 computers. Deschutes has no time for such technical feats. It invests mostly in brewing tanks, not data centres. Read also: Artificial intelligence can't replicate brains Only when Microsoft, Amazon and Google began offering AI software over the internet in recent years did these ideas seem plausible. Amazon is the public cloud leader right now, but each company has its strengths. Democratizing access to powerful AI software is the latest battleground, and could decide which tech giant emerges as the ultimate winner in a cloud infrastructure market worth $25 billion this year, according to researcher IDC. New generation "There's a new generation of applications that require a lot more intense data science and machine learning. There is a race for who is going to provide the tools for that," said Diego Oppenheimer, chief executive officer of Algorithmia Inc., a startup that runs a marketplace for algorithms that do some of the same things as Microsoft, Amazon and Google's technology.If the tools become widespread, they could transform work as more automation lets companies get more done with the same human work force.  C-SPAN, which runs three TV stations and five web channels, previously used a combination of closed-caption transcripts and manpower to determine when a new speaker started talking and who it was. It was so time-consuming, the network only tagged about half of the events it broadcast. C-SPAN began toying with Amazon's image-recognition cloud service the same day it launched, said Alan Cloutier, technical manager for the network's archives. Now the network is using it to match all speakers against a database it maintains of 99 000 government officials. C-SPAN plans to enter all the data into a system that will let users search its website for things like Bernie Sander's healthcare speeches or all times Devin Nunes mentions Russia.  As companies try to better analyse, optimize and predict everything from sales cycles to product development, they are trying AI techniques like deep learning, a type of machine learning that's produced impressive results in recent years. IDC expects spending on such cognitive systems and AI to grow 55 percent a year for the next five years. The cloud-based portion of that should grow even faster, IDC analyst David Schubmehl said.  "In the fullness of time deep learning will be one of the most popular workloads on EC2," said Matt Wood, Amazon Web Services' general manager for deep learning and AI, referring to its flagship cloud service, Elastic Compute Cloud. Image-recognition Pinterest uses Amazon's image-recognition service to let users take a picture of an item - say a friend's shoes - and see similar footwear. Schools in India and Tacoma, Washington, are using Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning to predict which students may drop out, and farmers in India are using it to figure out when to plant peanut crops, based on monsoon data. Johnson & Johnson is using Google's Jobs machine-learning algorithm to comb through candidates' skills, preferences, seniority and location to match job seekers to the right roles. Google is late to the public cloud business and is using its AI experience and massive computational resources to catch up. A new "Advanced Solutions Lab" lets outside companies participate in training sessions with machine-learning experts that Google runs for its own staff. USAA was first to participate, tapping Google engineers to help construct software for the financial-services company. Heather Cox, USAA's chief technology officer, plans a multi-year deal with Google. The three leaders in the public cloud today have also made capabilities like speech and image recognition available to customers who can design apps that hook into these AI features -- Microsoft offers 25 different ones. "You can build software that is cognitive - that can sense emotion and understand your intent, recognize speech or what’s in an image - and we provide all of that in the cloud so customers can use it as part of their software," said Microsoft vice president Joseph Sirosh.

Rekognition tells users what's in an image, Polly converts text to human-like speech and Lex - based on the company's popular Alexa service -- uses speech and text recognition for building conversational bots. It plans more this year. Chris Nicholson, CEO of AI company Skymind, isn’t sure how large the market really is for AI in the cloud. The massive data sets some companies want to use are still mostly stored in house and it's expensive and time-consuming to move them to the cloud. It’s easier to bring the AI algorithms to the data than the other way round, he said.  Amazon's Wood disagrees, noting healthy demand for the company's Snowball appliance for transferring large amounts of information to its data centres. Interest was so high that in November Amazon introduced an 18-wheeler truck called Snowmobile that can move 100 petabytes of data. Microsoft's Sirosh said the cloud can be powerful for companies that don't want to invest in the processing power to crunch the data needed for AI-based apps.   Take Norwegian power company eSmart Systems, which developed drones that photograph power lines. The company wrote its own algorithm to scan the images for locations that need repair. But it rents the massive computing power needed to run the software from Microsoft's Azure cloud service, CEO Knut Johansen said.  As the market grows and competition intensifies, each vendor will play to their strengths.  "Google has the most credibility based on tools they have; Microsoft is the one that will actually be able to convince the enterprises to do it; and Amazon has the advantage in that most corporate data in the cloud is in AWS," said Algorithmia's Oppenheimer. "It's anybody's game." Bloomberg Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Wanted by the FBI!

Inside the car-eat-car world of self-driving technology By Marisa Kendall TNS Posted:   04/08/2017 04:08:44 AM MDT In this photo taken Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2016, Devin Greene sits in the front seat of an Uber driverless car during a test drive in San Francisco. Uber is bringing a small number of self-driving cars to its ride-hailing service in San Francisco - a move likely to both excite the city's tech-savvy population and spark a conflict with California regulators. The Wednesday, Dec. 14, launch in Uber's hometown expands a public pilot program the company started in Pittsburgh in September. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (Eric Risberg / AP) First, it was just a dream. Then it became a quirky research project undertaken by a handful of the nerdiest engineers in the robotics industry. Now self-driving cars are on the brink of transforming transportation. The industry creating the technology for autonomous vehicles has morphed from a collaborative space of free-flowing ideas into a high-speed road race where the winners will seize a market expected to reach $77 billion by 2035, and the losers will be left in the dust. "The money involved — the money expended in these research efforts and the money expected if they're successful — has just ballooned and become so much more concrete and attainable," said Bryant Walker Smith, a scholar with Stanford Law School who specializes in self-driving car law. This March 24, 2017, photo provided by the Tempe Police Department, shows an Uber self-driving SUV that flipped on its side in a collision in Tempe, Ariz. The crash is one of several that have occurred nationwide and which demonstrates the challenges surrounding autonomous vehicles. (Tempe Police Department via AP) (/ Tempe Police Department) Major players — Google's Waymo, Tesla and Uber — are fighting to set the industry standard for consumer-ready autonomous vehicles. Each has much at stake — for Uber, autonomous vehicles could be the ride-hailing startup's best shot at profitability. But the road ahead is marred by potholes and speed bumps. The intense competition already has spawned at least two significant lawsuits. Coveted engineers working on autonomous cars are regularly switching companies. And a new class of scrappy startups creating self-driving software has emerged, poised to take market share from the established giants. Meanwhile, the major automakers, such as GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, are staking out their claims to the industry by investing in and partnering with the key tech players. It's too soon to tell what these marriages will yield, but several teams appear to be eyeing ride-hailing networks that could pose an added threat to Uber and Lyft. Nowhere is the tension better illustrated than in the contentious court battle between Google's Waymo and Uber. Waymo says its former engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential company files before leaving to found his own autonomous vehicle startup. The documents allegedly included designs used in Waymo's LiDAR sensor — one of the key technology components that lets self-driving cars "see" the road. Levandowski founded Otto, an autonomous trucking startup later acquired by Uber. Now Waymo says Uber is employing trade secrets to replicate Waymo's LiDAR sensors, and has asked a federal judge in San Francisco to prohibit Uber from using that technology — an order that could potentially devastate Uber's self-driving car program. A hearing is set for the first week of May, and Uber is scheduled to respond to Waymo's allegations in the coming weeks. In this Sept. 29, 2015 file photo, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors Inc., introduces the Model X car at the company's headquarters in Fremont, Calif. A Tesla in Autopilot mode can drive itself but it's not a "self-driving" vehicle, at least as far as safety regulators are concerned. So, instead of coming under heavy government scrutiny before being sold to the public, Tesla can mass-produce cars that automatically adjust speed with the flow of traffic, keep their lane and slam the brakes in an emergency. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP) Trade secret fights are common in Silicon Valley, but one thing that makes this one unique is Google's involvement, which highlights the priority it is placing on its self-driving car program. "Google doesn't sue people — period," said Eric Goldman, director of Santa Clara Law's High Tech Law Institute. "It's very exceptional to find Google as a plaintiff." The self-driving car industry was once a close-knit community, Stanford's Smith said, but the Waymo lawsuit illustrates how far it's come since those early days. "A lot of people were doing a lot of the same things at the same time — working at a university, consulting with a company and starting their own startup," he said. "Researchers were pretty freely sharing information." Tesla filed a similar lawsuit against a former employee in January. The suit accuses former Autopilot program manager Sterling Anderson of nabbing Tesla's confidential information and trying to recruit at least a dozen of the company's engineers before leaving to found a competing startup. Anderson and Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google's self-driving car program, recently launched self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation. "Tesla understands that some employees may decide to pursue other opportunities or even to create a startup of their own, and Tesla is typically supportive of their personal ambitions and respectful of their decisions," the company's lawyers wrote. "However, Tesla cannot sit idly by when an employee like Anderson abuses his position of trust." A lawyer for Aurora did not respond to a request for comment. Tesla, which says two of its engineers ended up following Anderson to Aurora, isn't the only company struggling to retain its top talent. A wave of nearly 20 people left Uber's Pittsburgh-based, self-driving car program in November and December, said a person familiar with the matter, with many of them joining Argo AI — a competing startup founded by an ex-Uber engineer. And last year, two of Google's top self-driving car executives left to start self-driving car startup Nuro.ai. Seeing those key people depart is especially painful in the self-driving car space, experts say, where there already is a shortage of talent because of the nascent state of the technology. "Finding and recruiting the top talent is really the name of the game," said Karl Iagnemma, co-founder and CEO of nuTonomy, a Massachusetts-based startup working on software for self-driving cars. "It's intense competition to get those people." Data also is a priority — companies must collect hours of driving data to teach their software to navigate the road. Google got an early start — the company began testing self-driving Prius cars in 2009, and its spinoff Waymo now has about 60 cars collecting data. Uber gathers information in a similar way, operating dozens of self-driving cars in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz. Tesla is mining data from the thousands of customers driving with its cars' Autopilot feature. Some smaller startups are taking a different approach. Palo Alto-based Nauto charges $400 for kits that let taxi drivers, fleet operators and Uber and Lyft drivers retrofit their cars with cameras that give alerts when a driver is doing something unsafe like tailgating. Those sensors funnel driving data back to the company, which is working on fully autonomous software. Apple, meanwhile, reportedly is working on a secretive self-driving car initiative called Project Titan, though details remain scant. So does information on how some of the industry's main players plan to profit from their self-driving technology. But as hints of future business plans emerge, there are signs of overlap that could add to the competition. Uber is betting its future on autonomous vehicles that can someday replace human drivers in its ride-hailing network. Tesla has expressed interest in creating its own ride-hailing network, and Waymo is rumored to be eyeing similar plans. When it comes to the actual technology behind their cars, the companies are even more tight-lipped. One key feature most autonomous vehicles share is LiDAR — sensors that use lasers to create a 3-D image of the car's surroundings. That's the technology at the heart of the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit. Waymo says it invested tens of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of engineering hours to build its own sensors, which would cost up to $60,000 off the shelf, only to have Uber copy that work. Trade secrets related to that technology are so precious to Waymo that when the court fight began, Waymo refused even to tell Uber which secrets it was accusing its rival of misappropriating. However the case plays out, it could have major repercussions for the industry. "If Google were to get everything that it is seeking," Smith said, "it could stop Uber's self-driving car program."

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN How To Google Home tips and tricks Google Home tips and tricks By Luke Johnson How To  Make yourself at home with Home Shares Now we're talking Google’s first smart speaker, the Google Home, has finally launched in the UK, five months after its US debut, and whether you've just bought a Home home or have had one for a while, and are looking to teach it some new tricks, we're here to help you get to grips with the search giant’s answer to Amazon’s brilliant Alexa-equipped Echo. Playing host to the Google Assistant, the Google Home is a smart speaker that’s as easy on the eye as it is effortlessly simple to use. Yes, you can use Google Home to check the weather, settle your latest pub debate, set alarms, and play music, but it’s about so much more than that. Move beyond the basics, and the Google Home hides a mass of innovative features and functions just waiting to be explored. “Like what?’ we hear you say with tech-loving anticipation. Well, there’s all this lot for a start – a selection of Google Home tips and tricks that will have you unearthing your latest gadget’s hidden secrets in no time. Prev Page 1 of 11 Next Prev Page 1 of 11 Next 1. Sync up your Spotify account You can’t currently pair your Apple Music playlists with the Google Home speaker, but if you’d rather listen to Spotify through the smart accessory than Google Play Music, then you got it. There is an option to set this up during the speaker’s initial install process, but if you rush past, repeatedly hitting ‘Next’ in a bid to simply get chatting with the future, you can always return and add Spotify streaming at a later date. To do this you’ll need to tap the ‘Listen’ tab on the top menu run of the Google Home app. Here, under ‘My music & audio apps’ you can sign in to your Spotify account to give you voice-controlled access to your favourite tunes. You will need to be a Spotify Premium subscriber to make use of this feature, however. Prev Page 2 of 11 Next Prev Page 2 of 11 Next 2. Cast content to the big screen Although a solid standalone device, Google Home isn’t a gadget that’s too proud to look to its mates for additional features. If you own a Google Chromecast as well as a Home speaker, you can now ask your Google Home to cast video content to the biggest screen in your house. As well as letting you send video content from YouTube and Netflix to your Chromecast-connected screen, you can use the Home’s voice controls to flick through your images, acting as a slideshow clicker of the vocal variety. Struggling to get things to play nice together? Don’t fret. By going to 'Settings > How to cast' in the Google Home app, you’ll be walked through the set-up process. Prev Page 3 of 11 Next Prev Page 3 of 11 Next 3. Play games with your voice The Amazon Echo has Runescape gaming capabilities, and not one to be outdone, Google has fitted Google Home with the ability to play a few games of its own. You’re invited to play too, and all you need is the right vocal command lines. Saying “OK, Google, play Crystal Ball,” “OK, Google, play Lucky Trivia,” or “OK, Google, play Mad Libs” will instigate a basic game. The smart speaker can join in your board game night too, when you open Monopoly to discover half the pieces are missing. Saying “OK, Google, roll two dice” will see the Assistant throw a couple of digital die and dictate you the score. Don't have time for a full on game? Why not just ask for a joke or a song instead? Prev Page 4 of 11 Next Prev Page 4 of 11 Next 4. Stop the kids finding things they shouldn't As much as you’d like to think that your new Google Home is your own personal assistant that will answer to your every whim, and only yours, in reality anyone with the ability to utter the “OK, Google” trigger can get the speaker started. This could pose some problems if your wee ones start asking some questions they shouldn’t when you’re not in the room. Fortunately then, you can apply a bit of a questionable content filter. Under Settings > YouTube Restricted Mode, you’re going to want to slide that toggle bar across to the 'on' position. Doing so will hide songs and videos that might not be appropriate for the little 'uns, and keep inappropriate content at bay. Prev Page 5 of 11 Next Prev Page 5 of 11 Next 5. Record your own nickname If you’ve been trying to get your mates to call you ‘Big Dog’ for years and they’re simply not having it, it might be time to change tack and target your Google Home instead. The inbuilt Google Assistant is less critical of your poor choice of moniker, and will call you anything you ask it to. It will automatically pull through your name from your synced Google account, but you can switch it up to whatever you like by heading to Settings > More Settings > Personal Info > Nickname. Here you’ll have a variety of options to choose from. You can either type in your nickname of choice, and check Google’s pronunciation with an audio test, spell it out, or, if Google’s struggling to grasp things, even record your own audio bite. Just don’t leave your phone unattended when your mates are around, or else the next time you use your smart speaker it might call you something rather unsavoury. Prev Page 6 of 11 Next Prev Page 6 of 11 Next 6. Sync-up your smart home It’s not just Google-branded devices that your Google Home can be made to play nice with; it’s compatible with a variety of third-party smart home devices too. It’s not quite as extensive a list as the Amazon Echo, but with the likes of Nest thermostats, Philips Hue smart lighting and Samsung’s collection of SmartThings devices, it includes many of the most popular devices out there. To sync-up your system into a single net of voice-controlled smart devices, you’ll need to point the Google Home app in the direction of Settings > Home Control > Devices. From here, pressing the big plus symbol in the bottom-right corner will let you add a number of connected accessories, including those from Honeywell, WeMo and Wink. Prev Page 7 of 11 Next Prev Page 7 of 11 Next 7. Activate Guest Mode Being the host with the most can be a pretty taxing job, even when you do have your new Google Home speaker acting as a talking point that’ll have your mates repeated spewing “OK, Google, tell me a joke,” or “OK, Google, how far away is Mars?” and the like. Pleasingly, you can give visitors temporary access to the speaker, letting them use it to do things like build up party playlists via the Guest Mode. To enable Guest Mode, tap the Devices icon in the top-right corner of the Google Home app’s home screen. Now, tapping the three-dot icon on your device of choice will let you select Guest Mode. Before activating, you’ll be asked if you want to add a pin number, ensuring that only those with the power can access your speaker and get the music flowing. Prev Page 8 of 11 Next Prev Page 8 of 11 Next 8. Unearth some Easter eggs Like the Echo, Google Home has been filled with loads of fun, and funny 'easter eggs' designed to give the Assistant a bit of personality and help you forget that you’re speaking to a computer. These range from quips and jokes to general knowledge trivia and the odd movie reference. For the smart speaker’s UK release, Google’s even thrown in some region-specific cultural references for you to discover. While you can get hints on existing easter eggs simply by asking your speaker “What are your easter eggs,” a couple you might want to try include “OK, Google, Hodor,” “OK, Google, who’s the fairest of them all,” and a Google classic, “OK, Google, do a barrel roll.” Prev Page 9 of 11 Next Prev Page 9 of 11 Next 9. Get the news you want Physical newspapers have long been circling the drain, but now the days of actually switching on the TV to hear about what’s going on in the world are numbered too. That’s because your Google Home will read the latest news headlines to you whenever you want – just ask “OK, Google, what are the headlines.” You don’t have to sit through loads of news you don’t care about either. You can select which news outlets feed you your content, and what subject matters you’re presented with. To make your custom news selections, you’ll need to go Settings > More Settings > News and cherry-pick the news sources you want to be offered, and what weighting you want given to each source. Prev Page 10 of 11 Next Prev Page 10 of 11 Next 10. Check who's been asking what Depending on what people have been asking your Google Home to do, this feature will fall somewhere between helpful and seriously sinister. That’s because your new smart speaker logs all of the things you and others ask it. Like, everything. You can go back and see what’s been asked too. While this will mostly be boring 'set timer', 'check the weather', 'how many days until my birthday'-style requests, being able to see what your other half/house mate has been asking Google to check could prove interesting, if privacy compromising. To see what’s been going on, in the app you’ll need to click Settings > More Settings > My Activity, where a list of past searches and commands will be laid bare.

Google RELATED STORIES 4 unsolved Mars mysteries we are still scratching our heads about IIT Madras scientists discover how inexpensive aspirin might be killing cancer cells Know why NASA is planning to crash its USD 3.26 billion spacecraft into Saturn Understanding the Civil War of Syria: One of the most devastating wars in human history India among 4 countries where smoking is one of the biggest killers In a bid to curtail fake information, Google is all set to start showing tags in its search results to show if a news item is true or not. Why was the fact check feature introduced?On its blog it stated that "Google was built to help people find useful information by surfacing the great content that publishers and sites create. This access to high quality information is what drives people to use the web and for contributors to continue to engage and invest in it. However, with thousands of new articles published online every minute of every day, the amount of content confronting people online can be overwhelming.  And unfortunately, not all of it is factual or true, making it hard for people to distinguish fact from fiction." When was it introduced?The search engine giant had introduced the fact checking feature first in Google News in the UK, last October.  Which are the places where the feature will be available? After getting good reviews for its initiative Google has decided to make the Fact check label in Google News available globally in all the languages. What does the Fact check label do?The Fact check label identifies articles that include information, whose facts have been checked by news publishers and fact-checking organizations. How does it work? According to the blog post, when you conduct a search on Google, for the first time,  it returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page. The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim. Image source:blog.google However, this information won't be available for every search result. Also, there may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions. "These fact checks are not Google's and are presented so people can make more informed judgements," the blog stated. "Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it's still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree," Google said in the blog post, from researcher Cong Yu and Justin Kosslyn of Google's sister company Jigsaw.

Government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees have accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," Google said in its statement. show chapters Top Silicon Valley CEO: This is what separates the good bosses from the bad ones    Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 12:01 PM ET | 00:58 Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 percent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labor Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

The Labor Department’s probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers’ privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

By: IANS | New York | Updated: April 8, 2017 3:30 PM The government has collected information that points towards the violation of federal employment laws by Google, the DoL said. (Reuters) The US Department of Labour (DoL) has accused Google of discriminating its female employees by paying them less than their male counterparts. According to a report in the Guardian on Saturday, The DoL, which is investigating the case, claims to have evidence of “systemic compensation disparities”. The allegations surface days after Google announced on Equal Pay Day that it had “closed the gender pay gap globally”. “Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today,” @Google tweeted earlier this week. The government has collected information that points towards the violation of federal employment laws by Google, the DoL said. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” the report quoted Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testifying in a San Francisco court, as saying. You May Also Want To Watch: The investigation in the case is not complete, but the DoL has said the government’s analysis at this point indicated discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology,” a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying.

The gender pay gap allegations were disclosed by a U.S. Department of Labor official during a court hearing in the US. The allegations come from evidence obtained as part of an ongoing investigation conducted by the DoL, according to The Guardian These are the world's most violent cities But the multi-billion dollar company deny the accusations and say they do not have a gender pay gap. Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, told a San Francisco court: ‘We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.’ And Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the DoL, said: ‘The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.’ Ms Herold added: ‘The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.’ (Picture: Getty/Myles Goode) Just five days ago the company claimed to have ‘closed the gender pay gap globally’ in a Tweet on the US’s Equal Pay Day. Trump just made it legal to shoot bears while they're hibernating But Google has been facing the lawsuit since January, the DoL have been trying to force Google to provide salary data and documents to the government. They say that Google should provide this information because it is a federal contractor. But, according to the DoL’s lawsuit, the company refused to hand over the data for a compliance review, which included job and salary history for employees. (Picture: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty) However, Google say it has already provided ‘hundreds of thousands of records’ and according to a company spokesperson, the requests outlined revealed confidential information, violated the privacy of Google’s employees and were ‘overboard’. Man accused of murder banned from own trial after punching lawyer In an effort to force the company to reveal more information, the case has now been taken to court. The DoL say data from 2015 salaries that the agency already has shows pay disparities. They now want earlier compensation data and the opportunity to interview employees confidentially.

IANS Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Google accused of discriminating against, underpaying women The US Department of Labour (DoL) has accused Google of discriminating its female employees by paying them less than their male counterparts. According to a report in the Guardian on Saturday, The DoL, which is investigating the case, claims to have evidence of "systemic compensation disparities". The allegations surface days after Google announced on Equal Pay Day that it had "closed the gender pay gap globally". "Let's make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today," @Google tweeted earlier this week. The government has collected information that points towards the violation of federal employment laws by Google, the DoL said. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," the report quoted Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testifying in a San Francisco court, as saying. The investigation in the case is not complete, but the DoL has said the government's analysis at this point indicated discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn't provided any data, or shared its methodology," a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying. --IANS qd/py/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

SoundStage lets you assemble and operate a music studio in the virtual space around you using the HTC Vive headset and wireless controllers — it’s like Tilt Brush for techno. “We’re excited to welcome Logan to the Google VR team,” a Google spokesperson told The Verge. “As a leader in thinking about creating in VR with his app SoundStage, we’re really inspired by what he’s built and for the potential for VR and creativity.“ SoundStage came out of its Early Access state on Steam last month with a 1.0 release that brought several new features but marked the end of active development. (It’s also since been made available for the Oculus Rift.) Olson joining Google does confirm that SoundStage will never grow into a serious Logic Pro or Ableton Live competitor — not that it could have anyway, in all likelihood — but Google says it’ll build on what he’s learned for existing and upcoming products. Google launched its promising Daydream VR platform alongside the Pixel and Pixel XL phones last fall, but news has been quiet in recent months. Few other manufacturers have announced Daydream-compatible devices since then, and the Pixel’s limited availability may well have limited Daydream’s visibility. If nothing else, though, Olson’s hiring shows that Google is still interested in investing in the creative possibilities of VR following the 2015 acquisition of the team behind Tilt Brush.

Google rolling out a new look for sign-in, deprecating old methods Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:30am PDTApr 7, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 159 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares244 Development Google News Starting on April 10th Google plans on pushing out an update to the sign-in page for Google accounts. This change is meant to further unify the sign-in process across your various devices. Although the news was posted to the G Suite Developers blog, we do fully expect this change to affect all Google accounts on all browsers, mobile browsers, and iOS apps (Android apps should not be affected). Google's SSO will also see additional changes beyond the purely cosmetic, as a new permissions grant redirect will be added to the login process, and permissions requested by a site or service will be more explicitly stated. The privacy-conscious will be excited to hear that Google is making such an effort to ensure a greater awareness on the part of users when it comes to privacy and consent in the use of third party services. Unfortunately, the permission request pane will no longer list what Google considers to be "standard" permission requests, presumably including basic account information. At least Google is making some effort to increase privacy awareness during login, even going so far as to increase the burden of responsibility for that privacy on developers by requiring contact information to be listed at a link on the permissions page. These aren't the only changes to login Google will be making. The use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe after April 20th, so if you are a developer relying on a webview redirect for OAuth to grant permissions you should consider changing to the official methods very soon before it breaks. Even some large companies like Airbnb and Pocket still haven't updated to the new methods, so it's worth taking a look. The rollout for the new sign-in is expected to be quite extended, potentially requiring more than two weeks for full visibility, so don't be surprised if you don't notice any changes to your sign-in process for a while. Most people probably won't notice much of a change beyond the cosmetic, anyway (although, our readers certainly aren't most people).

Thanks. Matt I'm sure this was first hinted at during the last Google IO... or possibly earlier. Every time I had to login since hearing that announcement I lost my shit wondering what was taking so long. Josh Crumley Of all the companies out there taking our personal data and using it for profit, Google is by far the least secretive about it. I'm glad they're making the permissions more detailed. Pixelexel I don't trust any company with my data other than Google. Kanoosh i don't even really trust google , but they are the least worst imo so i i go with them. :) HSidhu Google won't give your data to anyone, your Data is their power. Kanoosh never assume just because someone tells you something , that it is true.. i still hold plenty of caution with google as should everyone else.. no tin foil hats here, just reality of things... but i do hold them in higher regard for my personal data then any others , just always good to be safe. catalysto It's not just because "someone said so". It's because if Google was ever caught actually selling/releasing user data, they'd be completely screwed. Their entire business model depends on them keeping your data private.

Summerer The 'keep me logged in' button will be removed and instead you will always stay logged in until you explicitly logout in a browser.

Rabia Atta they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Devin Rodriguez What? Indefinite Implosion they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Ryne Hager I agree, I think he was fairly clear on that point. Devin Rodriguez Oh, okay. abc But which is the fastyest? BC This is interesting and I do like the the fact that the permissions are highlighted more than they were before. This is a good thing indeed! Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe Thank god. I absolutely hate apps that do that for Google / Facebook / Twitter permission request. If the first party app is installed, popup permission request screen on those apps. Don't load a webview asking me to login with email, password, 2FA. I wish FB and Twitter will also do what Google is doing now. Drunk Squirrel Like how titanium backup opens a webview of Google sign in in order to backup to Google drive, as opposed to other apps which show up a single pop-up,, correct Ryne Hager Right? They've got libraries for that, why make me enter my information again on a device I'm already logged in on? Imagine all the time that could have been saved. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I didn't even mention "save this new browser?" screen and "logged in from a new machine" emails that those webview logins cause. I uninstall any app that uses that, no matter how good the app otherwise is. HSidhu hello @ryne Hager aka new guy :) Ryne Hager Yo! Josh Crumley Welcome to the club!

For a limited time, customers who purchase the premium LG G6 get a Google Home, both with the Google Assistant. The premium LG phone has the Google Assistant built in and is available at major carriers and national retailers as early as this week, including AT&T, Best Buy, B&H, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular and Verizon. The 2017 G-series of premium flagship phones, the G6 was developed to specifically deliver the features consumers want most - a back to basics, no gimmicks approach to smartphones and a big screen experience without the inconvenience of a bigger phone. Now those consumers can buy the premium G6 and experience for themselves. Next generation LG smartphones The LG G6 mobile handset comes with a 5.7-inch QHD+ FullVision display, and for the first time ever in a premium LG smartphone, an 18:9 screen aspect ratio. The display is made possible by the 80% body to screen ratio, complemented by an aluminum and glass body. The new 18:9 format also offers a more immersive mobile experience for streaming videos and playing games compared to the conventional 16:9 aspect ratio. With the LG G6, you don't need to ask people in the picture to reposition, cram together or find another place to stand in order to get everything in, simply choose between standard and wide angle settings. With dual 13 megapixel rear cameras, including a 125-degree wide-angle optics, the G6 captures panoramic pictures that regular phone cameras can't. In addition, the LG premiumG6 delivers an outstanding and unique camera experience by creating seamless transitions when zooming in and out between the wide-angle and standard camera lenses even during 4K video capture. The new G6 also comes with an expanded 100-degree field of view with its 5MP front camera, which means users can take selfies without the need for a selfie stick. LG phone test The G6 can go just about anywhere without worry, thanks to its IP68 water and dust resistance so it is sealed against dust and can be safely immersed in up to 1.5 meters of water for as long as 30 minutes. Moreover, the LG G6 has the distinction of having met and passed the MIL-STD 810G standard for durability, conducted by independent testing and certification firm MET (Maryland Electrical Testing) Laboratories. The LG G6 passed the following 14 tests: Low Temperature, High Temperature, Humidity, Vibration, Solar Radiation, Low Pressure, Sand and Dust, Immersion, Temperature Shock, Salt Fog and Rain. Tough enough to pass military standards tests, the LG G6 is ready to tackle your day-to-day activities with confidence. The next generation phone from LG also endures further tests for battery reliability, including high temperatures and nail penetration, leveraging a proprietary technology that dissipates heat from vital components via an internal heat pipe, the first in an premium LG smartphone.    Next  C Spire 4G LTE network expansion project    Previous  Samsung Gear smartwatch value package    News by brand:LG    News by category:Premium smartphones    News by brand and category:LG Premium smartphones Latest LG announcements LG premium G6 next generation phone LG V30 features Dual cameras LG G6 preorder with free Google Home LG G6 price in Europe G6 from LG delivers outstanding 4K image quality LG G6 Premium smartphone with Dolby Vision LG X power2 Android phone with powerful battery LG Gram notebook series for the mobile lifestyle LG G6 handset comes with attractive design elements LG smartphone survey 2017 LG Electronics creates New Jersey construction jobs LG smartphone offers professional audio technology LG smartwatches preloaded with the Android Wear 2.0 LG Watch Sport smartwatch offers wireless charging LG Watch Style Android smartwatch   Latest news headlines Apple MacBook Smart Charger Samsung premium phone design LG G-Series premium mobile phone C Spire 4G LTE network expansion project LG premium G6 next generation phone Samsung Gear smartwatch value package Kyocera crystal components for mobile phones Western Digital unveils portable SSD Motorola Moto X 2017 Sony Alpha 9 SLR camera Premium cases for Galaxy S8 smartphone series Sony Alpha 7 III DSLR camera Sprint to offer best price for Unlimited plan ZTE Prestige 2 Android phone AXPONA 2017 Audio exhibition       5G Accessories Android Galaxy iPhone Camera Mobile phones Rumors Premium Smartphones Smartwatches Tablets TV   CES CeBIT IFA Photokina PMA

It works well recognizing the user’s handwriting input quickly and accurately most of the time. Find out how to install and use the new Google Handwriting tool here. Plus we’ve got another tip for quickly switching between the Google Handwriting Input keyboard and the regular Google Keyboard, which users of the handwriting tool should also install. Enter text in Android using a finger or stylus instead of a keyboard with the Google Handwriting Input. Install Google Handwriting Input Keyboard Grab the new Google Handwriting Input keyboard from the Google Play Store. It’s free and works great. Once users install it, the app will walk them through the setup process. If you fail to follow their steps, then use the following steps to get the Google Handwriting Input keyboard working. The setup wizard helps the user get started using the Google Handwriting Input keyboard on Android. Agree to the Terms of Service by tapping OK. Enable the Google Handwriting Input keyboard by tapping the number one box at the top of the setup wizard. Tap the ON/OFF switch in the input methods section of Settings which pops up after the previous step. Tap OK to acknowledge the warning that the Google Handwriting Input keyboard collects information as the user uses it. Tap on the second box in the setup wizard if needed to add other languages. Tap on the third box in the setup wizard to select the Google Handwriting Input keyboard in the phone’s input settings, which will pop up next. Choose the Google Handwriting Input Keyboard and the wizard returns to the setup wizard screen. The setup wizard gives users a chance to test the keyboard in a text input box that shows up after performing the above steps. Give it a try to see how well it recognizes even the messiest handwriting. It surprised me how accurately it recognized my terrible handwriting and entered the right text in the box. The wizard shows two more boxes at the bottom of the screen. The first is for configuring languages and the second lets users decide to help improve the keyboard by letting Google collect data.Tap on either box to do those things. The phone’s keyboard input will now use the Google Handwriting Input keyboard by default. However, it’s a good idea to also install the Google Keyboard. This keyboard works along with the handwriting keyboard. In the next step we’ll show you how to switch back and forth between them quickly. This makes it easier to type in text if the handwriting keyboard fails to recognize certain words. Google Keyboard uses regular input and gesture-based input to quickly enter text. Install the free Google Keyboard from the Google Play Store. It does a great job of recognizing gesture based typing, where the user slides their finger over keys instead of tapping each letter. How to Use the Google Handwriting Input Keyboard What do the icons in the new Google Handwriting Input Keyboard do and how do you quickly switch between it and the Google Keyboard so you can type using a regular keyboard? First, let’s take a look at the user interface of the handwriting keyboard. Here’s the Google Handwriting Input keyboard text entry box. See what the various icons mean below. The entry area in the center accepts the user’s handwriting. Use your finger or a stylus to write words instead of typing them. Notice how it suggests words above the input area. Tap on a suggested word to enter it or just wait and the keyboard enters it automatically. The center word is the one the keyboard thinks you want to enter. Tap the left or right box to change to one of those words instead. Also on the top row above the entry area, there’s a punctuation buttons including a period, comma and question mark. Along the bottom, there are a series of icons representing buttons. Here’s what each one does starting on the left and going on the right of the screen. Back – This button either looks like it does above, a rounded arrow, or a left pointing triangle. It’s the arrow when there’s handwriting in the window and its the triangle after it enters the text. Tap either one to go back. This is useful for undoing handwriting strokes to fix your mistakes in handwriting. Online Recognition – Notice the cloud with the line through it. This shows that Online Recognition is turned off. Online Recognition sends information to Google to recognize the handwritten words and improves Google’s recognition engine. The first time you use it asks permission. To keep the warning from popping up, tap on the box next to Don’t show this again. Tap on OK and it turns Online Recognition on. Globe – The button next to the cloud and before the space bar lets the user quickly switch between the handwriting keyboard and the Google Keyboard we installed before. The Google Keyboard has one too. Tap to toggle between them. Tap and hold to bring up the input settings feature on the phone. Space Bar – Adds a space after the word they keyboard just recognized. Tap and hold it to choose a different keyboard installed, like Swype or the phone’s default keyboard. This gives users access to the Google voice typing keyboard which lets us enter text with our voices Backspace – This works just like a regular backspace key. Tap and hold to quickly go back spaces, just as you would a normal keyboard. Search/Enter Key – The last key switches between an enter key and a search button, depending on the context. In Google Now’s input box it’s a search button, but at other places it’s an enter key with a circle and a right-pointing arrow.   10 Responses 06/07/2015 john Reply so how do i direct the hand writing input to a app? 08/16/2015 John Reply It’s automatic. Once Google Handwriting is selected as your input method, that input box will open instead of the text keyboard box in every app. 10/05/2015 Sharon Lippincott Reply I’ve been using the keyboard for months and LOVE it. Handwriting end as good or better. But I can’t find a way to add space between words if the app runs them together. Switching to keyboard for that is a time-consuming nuisance! What an I missing? 02/27/2016 Tammy Reply I don’t like the REAL THICK line it has! There is only room for one “short” word at a time! Could not find a line thickness adjustment, & using a pen did not work, as suggested, it was same thickness! Wish I could get the handwritng “option” I simply chose FROM the keyboard itself, to enable the handwriting function of my Galaxy S4. Not a choice on my new S6. I may tke it back to Costco! Dont like it. Was familiar with S4 functions & apps. I’m struggling w/the upgrade….. 05/21/2016 Hollyecho Montgomery Reply I have the galaxy S 5, I would love it more if I could make the line thinner 05/21/2016 Hollyecho Montgomery Reply I have the s7 edge-same Extra thick 05/22/2016 Sharon Lippincott Reply Yes, please thin the line. I hardly ever use the handwriting option, and just realized this thick line has a lot to do with it. 03/17/2017 sastiraj Reply goole play store 03/17/2017 sastiraj Reply goole play store open 04/08/2017 Hafee Reply I am a regular user of Google Handwriting Input…. very useful … works my local language ‘malayalam’ better than english !!

Android fragmentation may not be as pronounced as Google's distribution numbers would have you believe, Apteligent report says Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2016/06/29 3:51am PDTJun 29, 2016 39 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares59 Android OS Development Jelly Bean 4.1/4.2/4.3 KitKat 4.4 Lollipop 5.0/5.1 Marshmallow 6.0 News Fragmentation is the flaming torch we have to face each time a discussion about Android updates or development is started. Google releases monthly distribution numbers of its operating system, which detail the percentages of devices running a certain version of the OS that have visited the Play Store in the past 7 days. They're usually met with collective groans as Froyo and Gingerbread cling on to dear life month after month. But as Apteligent's monthly data report points out, Google doesn't take into consideration two important factors: devices that don't have the Play Store installed (ie Chinese handsets mostly) and device usage. A phone may access the Play Store, but it may not be actively used. Once that's taken into account, the image shifts greatly and you can see that there are far less devices in active use that are still running older versions of Android. As the table and graph at the top of the post show, Android usage distribution puts Lollipop at around half of the devices (vs. ~35% in Google's June numbers) and Marshmallow at almost double what Google says (19.4% vs. 10.1%). Apteligent's usage distribution drops KitKat from around 31% in Google's stats to roughly 25%, Jelly Bean from ~19% to 6.8%, and shows that everything prior (ICS, Honeycomb, Gingerbread, and Froyo) is practically irrelevant. Now sure, these are numbers taken from Apteligent's report, which is based on devices that have apps with the Apteligent SDK installed, but they do show a new picture of Android's version distributions. The report compares the three top releases (KitKat, Lollipop, and Marshmallow with 93% of usage base) to iOS' two most important versions (iOS 8 and iOS 9 with 97% of usage base) to conclude that "Android is not fragmented." Or, in my opinion, fragmentation is not as pronounced as you'd think it is. The report contains a lot more data, including Project Fi device distribution (Nexus 5X 38%, 6P 36%, 6 26%), stats on device-specific crashes (Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 wins the cake) and OS-specific crashes (Android 4.1 is the most unstable while 5.0 and 5.1 are the most stable), Android TV usage compared to Apple TV (it's half), and the manufacturers that release the fastest updates (Samsung, LG, Sony, HTC) compared to those that are super slow (Amazon, Motorola, ZTE).

Eumelanin Knight Froyo No! It's not your time! 😢 Honestly though, these numbers makes sense. I use my Froyo phone, but it's merely for security purposes and not much else really. I only bother it to charge it once a week. Less when I forget it exists. *shrugs* Rita El Khoury You're part of the problem :p Eumelanin Knight The problem?! You mean The RESISTÁNCE! #Froyo4Life Suicide_Note Keep Froyo alive! Peterson Silva NO >:c Kanoosh #froyolivesmatter Pablo Pastore Security and Froyo in the same sentence, LOL! philosopher_Mk Totally irrelevant numbers because it shows only apps with Apteligent sdk . Now Google can take people who use G+ and numbers will be impressive. Kat I hope this isn't one of those "G+ IS A GHOST TOWN HEH HEH I HAVENT EVEN BEEN ON THE WEBSITE BEFORE" things... Because it's not. Sincerely, A Google+ User. philosopher_Mk No, I mean Google can take people that use G+ and make Android distribution chart according to that data. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Is Froyo really dead! I need to request time off for the funeral. Dmitry Stepanushkin Probably not supported by Apteligent, so its safe to put 0% for 2.2 for them. jawsnnn Wait... what exactly are the apps that use Apteligent SDK? Do they represent a faithful approximation of the market? Is it certain that these apps are not better/faster on newer devices implying that people wouldn't use them on older devices/OSes as much? Are we absolutely certain that these numbers have any correlation with OS share of market? If all this is true (which I doubt very much) then there's value to this news. Otherwise this seems like a very clear case of preceptor's bias to me if there's such a thing. Rita El Khoury Yup that's the big asterisk for these numbers as I mentioned. Apparently, the SDK has a really wide reach, but it definitely won't account for all devices and biases. Soraya Xel Exactly. No ad SDK will ever have numbers as accurate as Google pulling from the whole store directly. And unlike the article claims, since it's using Play Store numbers, no Google's numbers really don't include Chinese handsets without Google Play. Rita El Khoury The article says that Google's numbers DO NOT include Chinese handsets, which is one of the two problems with Google's way of tallying distribution. "Google doesn't take into consideration two important factors: devices that don't have the Play Store installed (ie Chinese handsets mostly) and device usage." Soraya Xel Sorry, I think I misr-parsed while reading. As a note, I'd be curious what portion of the Chinese market Apteligent believes they cover. As the Chinese internet is almost like an entirely separate thing: The Chinese have their own ad companies and such for example, and I suspect a Silicon Valley ad company is probably an extreme minority over there, if it works at all. RajivSK Is it really a problem though, that Google leaves out the devices that don't log in to the play store? Most app developers distribute their apps through that same play store, I would guess. RainMotorsports When 20% don't have access to the play store it skews the numbers quite substantially RajivSK Sure but my point is those same people won't be able to buy your app. Distribution numbers are not made public for the enjoyment of android police readers alone you know ;) Dmitry Stepanushkin I dont care Apteligent usage numbers. I believe Google knows better way to track usage of its own devices, and there are a lot of apps which dont use Apteligent. Sam Del Valle Somewhere out there. Someone has a legion of Froyo phones ready to strike. #KeepFroyoAlive #JustKiddingLetItDie Andrew Gallagher I still power on my Galaxy Nexus every few months for some reason, so I'm contributing to the Android 4.3 stats. My father in law is still actively using my old Nexus One, on Gingerbread, but it never connects to the internet. Phone/sms/camera only. SavageJeep WTF is FroYo and what does it have to do with my crappy 5 year old phone! /s #BringBackDonut Gerardo Sarabia I have seen a few froyo/gingerbread devices. All of them on hands of old Salvadorean people that doesn't even know how to change the time on their phones or install/delete apps. Their phones could have been updated to Android Z and they would still don't notice or give a fuck. Fragmentation can be a thing, but not a problem. Heiro78 is no one gonna talk about how Samsung, LG, Sony, and HTC are the best at rolling out android updates? It makes it sound like they are the best and so they should be lauded for it. We need to make a bigger stink about it that while they may be the best. It's still a shitty time frame for updates! jcopernicus So basically Android Devices without Google Bloatware Play Services are more up to date than those with it? GG Google. Leeroy Jenkins Guys let's whip out our Froyo devices and log in! #MakeFroyoGreatAgain bekifft "5.0 and 5.1 are the most stable" I was with you until there. Now I don't know what to think of this report. But it definitely sounds a lot more like what you'd expect. Rita El Khoury You have to read the report to see the way they do their stats. They tally all app crashes, then figure out which crashes are app-related and which are device-related and which are OS-related. The OS-related crashes are then compared between different versions, with the top one taking 100% and the others being counted comparatively. Marshmallow got a higher percentage than Android 5.0/5.1 but not by much. the closed pistachio Woah there, my Galaxy S2 running JB 4.1.2 is perfectly stable! ...provided that I reboot it at least once a week, and that don't use the stock kernel, and also that I make sure the RAM never fills up all the way or everything freezes... And another thing, I'm pretty sure the Donut numbers are only non-existent because Google cut support for older devices. My G1 no longer connects to Google servers but I still boot it up every few months or so for nostalgia purposes. I wonder if any statistics exist for number of people who do the same... Marcellus1 I don't use it regularly anymore, but my Galaxy S3 is running Marshmallow just fine. I intend to put Namey McNameface on it when I can. the closed pistachio Yeah the old Galaxy S phones are great to have around. So much developer support :) I've put a 4800mAh battery in mine now and use it mostly as a music player, but also take it out over my HTC One if I know I won't be near a charger for a few days. supersanborn But if Fragmentation isn't as bad as believed, what click-baity titles will BGR come up with to bash Android? Adeel Ejaz Being a Mobile App Developer, I can tell you this data should be looked at with a grain (okay, a huge chunk) of salt. There is a massive misunderstanding in this article, just because an app is installed on Marshmallow, it doesn't mean any user on Froyo can install it. Most of the time, we developers ignore older versions simply because we don't have the time or resources to develop for older versions. So what you are seeing is good for Apteligent folks so they know what versions of Android developers support using their SDK, not what the real world usage is. For example, most apps I build will never be installed on ICS or below and if I uses this SDK, it will look like I don't have any users for old OSes. @nsmartinworld As of March 2017, Nougat was on 3 percent of devices and Marshmallow on 15 percent. That is some pretty serious fragmentation. Google’s OS distribution has no historical equal for incompetence.

Las Vegas Sun April 9, 2017 Currently: 59° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events Sports betting UNLV sports Gaming Vegas Golden Knights Smith's World HS sports awards nomination Newsletter signup U.S. regulators accuse Google of underpaying female workers Virginia Mayo / AP This March 23, 2010, file photo, shows the Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels. Associated Press Saturday, April 8, 2017 | 12:02 a.m. SAN FRANCISCO — Government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees have accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," Google said in its statement. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 percent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labor Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm.

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0.

By Owen Hughes April 8, 2017 07:30 BST Get the most out of your smartphone with these handy tips.iStock Smartphones have become such and inseparable part of our lives that they have essentially become an extension of ourselves, serving not just as communication tools but diaries, photo albums, personal computers, blogs, personal trainers and so much more besides. The trick is putting these functions to use, and ensuring that your smartphone is not just there when you need it but is playing an active role in improving your day-to-day life – or at least making it easier. Below are seven ways you can make your mobile phone work better for you. Switch on Location services Ignore the privacy paranoia and enable location servicesGoogle/ YouTube There's a bit of a stigma about location-tracking services amongst the privacy-conscious, but in all honestly the paranoia is a bit overblown. While you might feel uncomfortable about Google and co knowing your exact whereabouts, the likelihood that this is going to be used for nefarious purposes is basically zero. Location services can be hugely useful once set up, providing you with handy info such as directions, traffic conditions, nearby transport links and estimated journey times. If you find yourself constantly late or running for the train services like Google Now can alert you when you need to leave, automatically updating as traffic conditions change. It also allows you to use safety services that let your friends find you should you get into trouble, such as iOS's Find my Friends feature and Google's Trusted Contacts app for Android. Blue light from your mobile phone can stop you falling asleepGoogle Play Use a blue light filter Smartphones can improve our lives in so many ways, but being glued to our gadgets is having a harmful effect on our sleep. Scientific studies have shown that the blue light emitted by mobile phones inhibit the release of melatonin, a hormone your brain releases to help you nod off. A sound piece of advice here is to stop using your phone at least an hour before bed, however you can also help your brain switch off by using a blue light filter. More recent versions of Android and iOS come with this as a built-in feature, however you can also download them in app form. Twilight and Blue Light Filter – Night Mode for Android and FlexBrite for iOS are popular options. Create a Do Not Disturb schedule While blue light on your smartphone can keep you awake, not giving yourself regular down time can lead to stress, particularly if you're being woken up by calls or notifications in the middle of the night. Set up a Do Not Disturb schedule on your phone so that you get a much-needed break at some point during the day – preferably starting an hour or so before you go to bed and ending after you wake up. It's much easier to relax after a hard day's work when you're not being constantly pestered by emails, apps and social media. You could also incorporate Do Not Disturb into your daily routine to help you disconnect and focus while doing more pleasurable activities like eating, exercising and spending time with friends. Set reminders Smartphones are truly all-in-one devices and have all but eliminated the need for physical diaries, calendars and to-do lists. Yet some users are still not making use of the awesome organisational powers they provide. Thanks to voice-activated assistants like Siri and Google Assistant, setting yourself an important reminder is as easy as tapping a button and telling your phone what you need to remember and when. If talking into your phone makes you uncomfortable, you can easily head into your smartphone's main calendar or note-taking app and jot it down. These can also be geo-tagged, set to be triggered when you pass a certain destination. For instance, if you plan on buying milk on the way home from work but are absent minded, your phone will vibrate to alert you as you stroll past the shop. Provided you schedule them tactically, there's no reason why you should forget anything ever again. Set up mobile payments Mobile payment systems can stop you being stranded in an emergencyGoogle Mobile payments are set to become more popular than payments made using cash in the next few years, so if you haven't yet climbed aboard this speeding hype train, now's the time. Millions of shops, bars, restaurants and transport networks now let you pay for goods with a quick tap of your phone, meaning less time fumbling in your pockets for change or queuing at ATMs. The best thing about mobile payment systems like Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay is that they give you an emergency option if you accidentally leave your wallet at home – because the chances of you forgetting both your purse and your phone on the same day are slim. Make use of free Wi-Fi Make the most of public Wi-Fi, provided it's secureReuters You can help eliminate the worry of bill shock with an easy way to save on data by piggybacking on Wi-Fi connections whenever possible. This will not only help prevent you overstepping your monthly data allowance and running up inadvertent charges, but will also leave you more data for when you need it. When in public, always make sure you only connect to secure open networks, and where possible use a VPN to keep your data encrypted and your activity private. Connect everything Nest For the ultimate in efficiency from your gadgets If That Then This (IFTTT) is a free tool that connects internet-enabled IoT devices and online services together. You can make the daily grind go smoothly by using any number of 'apps' that can perform customised tricks, such as turning on your Wi-Fi kettle when the GPS on your phone shows you're 10 minutes from home; automatically muting your mobile when you arrive at work; sending you a text if your smoke alarm goes off, or switching on your heating when your alarm goes off in the morning. There are heaps of these so-called IFTT 'recipes' for iOS and Android that basically act like min-hacks to turn your phone into the ultimate smart controller to supercharge your gadgets and life.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 8 April 2017 | MYT 1:00 PM Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results The fact check feature is the latest sign Google is responding to mounting pressure to police content it hosts online after criticism the company, and other Internet firms, help spread misinformation. — Reuters First fact-checking came to Facebook Inc. Now it's coming to Google.   The world's largest search engine is rolling out a new feature that places "Fact Check” tags on snippets of articles in its News results. The Alphabet Inc unit had already run limited tests. On April 7, it extended the capability to every listing in its News pages and massive search catalogue.  This is the latest sign Google is responding to mounting pressure to police content it hosts online after criticism the company, and other internet firms, help spread misinformation.  Google isn't entirely giving up its usual hands-off approach: The company is letting others do the fact-checking. The approach is meant to legitimise or question claims online, Google said in a blog post. Checked search results list the name of the person or group making the assertion and the determination of the fact-checker.  Although Google is working with established fact-checking organisations, like PolitiFact and Snopes, it's also opening up the system to publishers including The Washington Post and The New York Times. In theory, media organisations could use the new feature to fact-check each other. Or publishers could give different verdicts on the veracity of the same article.  ”These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgments,” Google said. “Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.”  While any publisher can apply to add fact-check labels to content, Google search algorithms will determine whether they appear in results, a spokeswoman said.  The company plans to reserve the label for search results about addressable public claims of fact, rather than opinion. Publishers can write the labels that appear next to results. Examples include “True," “Mostly False,” or “Pants on Fire!” (a favourite of PolitiFact).   Outcry over the influence of misinformation, or “fake news,” began after the US Presidential election. Facebook, a leading driver of online traffic to publishers in the US, took the brunt of criticism. On April 6, the company introduced new features in its flagship social network designed to show users how to detect false news.  But Google has not been immune to scrutiny. Critics have pointed to several instances of inaccurate and misleading articles surfacing in search results. Such examples are particularly stark when Google delivers what it finds in the form of tiny snippets, a priority for the company in recent years.  ”From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here,” Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai told BBC News shortly after the US election.  Google is not paying publications or fact-checking organisations. A spokeswoman for Google said articles that used the new fact-check label would not be ranked differently in search results. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Wonder of compound interest Chong Wei to meet Lin Dan in epic final Pulling in pau lovers for over 40 years Rats!

Published Apr 8, 2017, 11:26 am IST Updated Apr 8, 2017, 11:26 am IST Google has also gone ahead to implement fact policing on its websites too.  YouTube will now start blocking ads to videos that receive a low interest — less than 10,000 views. YouTube is now cracking down heavily on those who post extremist and pirated videos on the streaming portal. To do this, they are implementing a new move which will cut down revenue of those who put up videos occasionally. YouTube has said that they will start placing advertisements only on those videos which have crossed more than 10,000 views. YouTube will now start blocking ads to videos that receive a low interest — less than 10,000 views. This move comes after major brands started pulling out their ad business from YouTube after fearing that they would be indirectly funding terrorism and illegal activities on the video platform. This move also came in after Google failed to police the videos that were being showcased on their streaming service platform, reported The Telegraph, UK. The British Government, Tesco, Royal Bank of Scotland, McDonald’s are some of them who have refused to give ads to Google/YouTube after they found their advertisements featured on extremist videos. Google was also forced to publicly apologise in March after the companies withdrew their advertisements. YouTube’s new policy should not affect those who are earning a living from YouTubing, but the service said that the new threshold will give Google enough information to determine the validity of the said channels. Google has also gone ahead to implement the policing on its websites by adding Fact Check as a feature to the search engine. This new feature can help prevent spreading of fake news and Google will also implement a ‘true’, ‘mostly false’ and ‘pants on fire’ ratings to help identify such news, with the help of fact checking organisations such as Snopes and Politifact. The fact checking will not be from Google and will be presented to people so that they can make more informed judgements. Google also said earlier that they will be employing more staff to do fact checks manually rather than wait for people to flag them. The move was welcomed by the IBSA, a trade body that represents British Advertisers.

Google brings On Tap's screenshot feature to Assistant on the Pixel Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/01/11 9:33am PDTJan 11, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares152 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Google got in a habit of dumping all sorts of features and incomplete ideas into Google Now on Tap. With the move away from On Tap, Assistant focused more on voice control and connected services. However, some of the useful features of On Tap were left behind too. In the case of screenshots, it looks like Google is bringing it back in Assistant. This feature appears to be available to everyone (or almost everyone), but it's subtle enough you might have it and not even realize. The screenshot feature is available in the stripped down screen search feature that's part of Assistant (maybe you didn't even know that was a thing). When you open Assistant on any screen other than the home screen, you can scroll down to get cards about screen contents. The screen search part of Assistant is not as in-depth as On Tap was, but at the bottom is a new "Share Screenshot" button. Pressing the share button captures a screenshot and immediately opens the system sharing dialog. Just like the version in On Tap, the status bar icons and nav buttons are hidden in these screenshots. It's a nice thing to have, but I'd be much more excited to get the text copying features of On Tap in Assistant.

Brian Then feel free to tell me how I've got it. Nick Why don't you tell me? You seem well aquatinted with flashing custom ROMs, just not updating them. So, yes, your Nexus 5 is modified. Brian Don't have a clue what you're on about. Nothing about assistant is in the post. The share screenshot in assistant is for every device modified or unmodified. Rúben Santos Probably has a modded build.prop Brian nope JSo I think if you have Google Assistant on any device, you should have or will have this. Rúben Santos Yeah, the problem is really getting Assistant without that workaround. If we don't have Assistant we always have this feature on Now on Tap Roh_Mish Already on other devices. Pixel lacked this. chandrizzle It's working on my 6P with Google Assistant. I've done the workaround to enable GA, but at least we know the screenshot function isn't limited to Pixels. Suicide_Note Wow, i have no idea how long I've had that, but it's nice that it's back. skitchbeatz yassss motoridersd I have it. It's kind of a PITA to get to when there's a lot of information generating cards. I am happy to see it back but I hope it gets a better implementation as it evolves. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman It's a pretty quick scroll to the bottom from my testing. Paul_Werner True but from Now on Tap that button was always right at the bottom without needing to scroll through the cards Jarrett Lennon Kaufman True, but it was so much slower to load in my experience that they probably cancel each other out. Eric Ravenscraft Come on guys, we've all smashed a Lego set so that we can have the pleasure of building it all over again. Can we really judge Google for doing the same thing with the features for its voice assistant? Just smash it to pieces and put it back together! Building is half the fun! Adam Margeson But when they smash the set and then throw away half the pieces... Eric Ravenscraft I mean, I lost a lot of pieces under the couch, but I found them eventually. I think we wall remember being a kid. Adam Margeson Yeaaaah. Mostly space-ships and cars with the occasional building. Syukri Lajin i'm sure your lego set aren't being used actively by millions of users in the world before you break it apart so that you can build it again :D Mariajbartholomew Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Thank you so much! This very similar to the Samsung vanilla functionality Roh_Mish Only good thing with now on tap was ability to select text and copy/search them. Until they add that, assistant is dead to me brnpttmn You can. Select text and then activate the assistant. Roh_Mish Now on tap allows you to select text that are otherwise unselectable. Can't do that on assistant. refthemc Why these two are separate is beyond me at this point... wickets "available to everyone (or almost everyone)" Larry to bizzy counting his billions to add me onto the update list! yamaha83 copy text from a screen shot is something i severely miss.. hope it comes soon David Hyman So can you not select text with assistant to get it to preference something specific?

Placement of Ads: Google AdSense ads are best to customize and blend with your site's layout. They have custom sizes and responsive ad units to make your blog look better with ads even on a mobile device. According to the heat map given by Google itself, the best places to display AdSense ads for high CTR are near the content. Placing an ad just above your primary content section can show the best results. Google also suggests ad placements near to the top and top left sections to get maximum clicks. Placing an ad at the bottom of the post can also work on your favor. Top 10 Tips On How To Increase Your AdSense Page CTR (Click-Through-Rate) The image above shows the best places to show AdSense ads as per Google, the deep the orange color the better the CTR. While placing an ad in the areas marked as light orange and yellow will have adverse effects on your earnings. AdSense link units after the topic or post title or just after the menu bar also will surprisingly increase your AdSense CTR too, give it a shot. Ad Size: According to the norms, the bigger the ad size, the higher the earnings. While we can never say what size of AdSense pays more or gets more clicks, placing a skyscraper image to the left of forums or to the right sidebar, above the fold is better. Google also suggests using of responsive ads to cater to your mobile audiences. Though Google supports multiple customization on your ad sizes, I would say do not go for more offbeat ad sizes. It is so because those ads are not always bided on Google by publishers. So sometimes they might display nothing when the inventory of AdSense is empty thereby leaving you with no earnings. See your site with your visitor's eyes: What usually happens is we decide the placement and size of AdSense ads on the backend and then hope for all good to happen. We rarely experiment on how our visitors are treating our ad placement and ad sizes. I am always in favor of doing something with proper testing. We cannot just load the upper fold of our blogs with ads in order to get some dollars. I suggest you to have some analytics performed to see how visitors are interacting on your site. Here are some of the tools and services for tracking visitor actions on your blog. Free services like WordPress plugins (hotspots, heatmaps) and SumoMe. Google Analytics and Clicky. CrazyEgg (premium): This lets you know much more than just clicked points. You can get an idea where your readers scroll up to in a post and where the readers land from, on your blog. It also tracks visitors from what referral source click the most so that you can focus on them. It is much more advanced system of site tracking. With any of those tools, am sure you are gonna get the green snake beneath the grass. Fight Ad blindness: Ad-blindness is a problem that is commonly faced by the blog readers these days. So many sites with ads on the right sidebar make your visitors immune against your sidebar. They hardly see what is there. I have tested this with SumoMe, and I did not record even a single click on my right sidebar for my most popular posts. Here are some tips to increase AdSense Page CTR by reducing ad-blindness. Use right sidebar as your default sidebar. Many blogs including now have their default sidebar placed on the left. Use different ads or change the theme once in a while. Try experimenting different ad forms and sizes. Also, remember to make your Ad blend with the current theme of your website/blog so as to make it eye pleasant. Get a Responsive Blog/Website: Having a responsive website theme, like genesis, sahifa, porto e.t.c gets your site optimized for your mobile readers. Not only these layouts make your site user friendly, but also they make sure AdSense ads are displayed (and correctly) to your mobile visitors. And more ads is definitely proportional to more CTR. Reduce bounce rates: Bounce rates are always harmful to your blog. The longer a reader stays on your blog, the more engaging your content is considered. If you can lower your bounce rates visitors will now be visiting more than one page on your blog. That means more chances to get them click on your ads. Here is an article to help you reduce bounce rates. Blend your ads according to your blog: When creating a new AdSense ad for your blog, Google gives you an option to alter the theme and font of the ad unit. While I would say the default is good, you should not hesitate to experiment on what works and what not. Skim through some basic tips: Blend text and link ads according to your site's theme and font. Do not blend visual ads to make them look weird in an attempt to fighting ad-blindness. Maintain professional looks of the ad units; don't try to make an ad appear not as an Ad. Optimize your content: Content too has so much say in AdSense CTR. You can have noticeable uplift in your CTR with content optimization. Write quality content: Whenever you write an article, write quality stuff and give relevant examples. In case ads are placed around this part can take keywords from your examples and display a relevant ad, tempting to be clicked. Stay away from thin content: Having 3 display ad units on post of 400-500 words is nothing but utter foolishness. This will drive your readers crazy and they can just leave your site for ever. Write at least posts of reasonable length with all media (images or embedded videos) to bring freshness to your blog. This will reduce bounce rate = more CTR. This will also reduce ad blindness = more CTR. Avoid Black-Hat Tricks: Google is very stringent on its ad policies. It can totally ban your AdSense account for trying improper or black hat tricks. Or even ban your domain for ever so that you cannot use AdSense on that domain. Here are some of the basic DON'TS for Google AdSense. Do not use floating AdSense ads. Do not use ads on pop ups on your blog. Do not place Ads near multimedia in your post, so as to mislead your audience into thinking that the ad is a part of your post. Do not use any call to action or click requests to boost AdSense CTR. Experiment your way to success: You can experiment till your mind's content when using AdSense from Google. These experiments will let you know the right and perfect AdSense ads spot and size for your blog. You will gradually know what ads and ad types are getting more CTR and then can make use of it to earn even more. Try experimenting with ad sizes and fonts. Its not that a popular blog says skyscrapers are good so they will work for you too. In fact you can also have experiment for ad size. Try using different colors to blend your ads in your theme or make them stand out. For customizations, sky is the limit. Over to you These are some of the tips and tricks to boost AdSense earnings. You can customize more and look for what AdSense ads have the highest CTR. What are your tips to increase AdSense CTR?

Olson's hire is the latest hint at Google's interest in virtual reality as a tool for creative work. “We’re excited to welcome Logan to the Google VR team,” a Google spokesperson told The Verge regarding the hire. “As a leader in thinking about creating in VR with his app SoundStage, we’re really inspired by what he’s built and for the potential for VR and creativity.“ SoundStage launched on Steam last month, coming out of Early Access with a 1.0 release that also marked the end of its development. The app allows users to operate a music studio in virtual space using the HTC Vive headset and controllers. The app has also since been made available for Oculus Rift. While Olson joining Google seems to confirm SoundStage has reached the end of its growth, Google says it plans to build on what Olson has learned for upcoming and existing products. However, Olson's hire isn't the first show of Google's interest in the creative possibilities of VR. The company also acquired the team behind the app Tilt Brush back in 2015. Google's Daydream VR platform launched along with its Pixel and Pixel VR phones last year. While news has been mostly quiet regarding the platform, Google did release a small update for the app on Friday.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM.

More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol.

Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Uber fires back at Google spinoff in self-driving car case Uber fires back at Google spinoff in self-driving car case Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. By: AP | San Francisco | Published:April 8, 2017 9:53 am Uber is now presenting evidence that it began working on technology dramatically different from Waymo’s more than a year before buying Otto. Uber is scoffing at claims that its expansion into self-driving cars hinges on trade secrets stolen from a Google spinoff, arguing that its ride-hailing service has been working on potentially superior technology. The legal defense, presented in documents filed Friday in San Francisco federal court, marks Uber’s first detailed response to explosive allegations that its self-driving cars rely on crucial technology designed by Waymo. That company was created from an autonomous-vehicle project started at Google eight years ago. Once a Google ally, Uber emerged as a rival in the self-driving car market in early 2015 when it began developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. Now, Waymo is trying to thwart that effort by persuading US District Judge William Alsup to block Uber’s self-car driving expansion on the grounds that it hinges on a high-tech heist. The case’s outcome could alter the race to build self-driving cars that may transform transportation, reduce traffic deaths and launch a huge new industry. LASER FOCUS Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. After the alleged theft, Levandowski left Google early last year to found a self-driving car startup called Otto that Uber bought for $680 million last August. But Uber is now presenting evidence that it began working on technology dramatically different from Waymo’s more than a year before buying Otto. The dispute centers on a pivotal part of self-driving cars called LiDAR, an array of laser-based sensors that enable self-driving cars to see what’s around them so they can safely navigate roads. Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. In sworn declarations and diagrams, Uber argued that its engineers are working on a more sophisticated form of LiDAR than Waymo’s. Among other things, Uber says its LiDAR uses four lenses for transmitting and receiving laser lights as opposed to the single lens in Waymo’s version. “Waymo could not be more wrong, and Uber’s design could not be more different,” Uber’s lawyers wrote in their rebuttal to the allegations. “And no wonder — Uber’s LiDAR was developed by a different team, using a different beam pattern, and leveraging different know-how.” WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE What’s more, Uber says its custom-designed LiDAR system hasn’t even been installed on the self-driving cars that it has been testing in Pittsburgh, Arizona and San Francisco. Instead, the company says it has been relying on LiDAR systems built by other vendors. Much of the information contained in Friday’s filing was redacted to protect confidential business plans and secret technology. Once a Google ally, Uber emerged as a rival in the self-driving car market in early 2015 when it began developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. Uber may have its work cut out to sway Alsup, who has said in previous court hearings that Waymo has presented some of the strongest evidence he has seen in his judicial career. A hearing on Waymo’s request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for May 3. Although Waymo isn’t suing him in this case, Levandowski will play a central role in how the lawsuit unfolds. Levandowski helped establish Google as an early leader in self-driving cars, earning him more than $120 million in incentive pay, according to information inadvertently revealed in court papers earlier this week. Before Levandowski defected from Google early last year start Otto, Waymo alleges he downloaded more than 14,000 documents containing trade secrets that is now helping Uber. After buying Otto, Uber put Levandowski in charge of Uber’s self-driving project, a job that has been imperiled by this lawsuit. Alsup has warned that he may issue an order barring Levandowski from involvement in Uber’s self-driving car division if he sides with Waymo. Uber says it hasn’t found any evidence of ever possessing any of the files that Levandowski stands accused of stealing. Levandowski, meanwhile, has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to protect himself if criminal charges are filed against him.

By Avi Salzman April 7, 2017 6:32 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Google was accused by a government official of paying men more than women. Photo: Google Google’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil.” But recent controversies have made it harder for the ad giant to claim the moral high ground. Advertisers have recently gotten upset because Google was putting their ads alongside hateful content on YouTube. And now the company is being accused of discriminating against women. More from Barron’s Next Uh-Oh Google, Amazon’s Growing Its Ad Business Why Some Advertisers Are Walking Out on Google An Apple Analyst Goes Searching for the Next Big Thing Google, part of the Alphabet corporation, has systematically paid its female employees less than its male employees, a Department of Labor manager said in court on Friday, according to the Guardian. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testified in a San Francisco court, according to the newspaper. Disparities in pay are nothing new in Silicon Valley -- or all of America, really -- but this case was “very significant,” an anonymous DoL official told the Guardian. Google vehemently denied disparities in a statement, calling the charges “unfounded” and saying the government hasn’t provided any data to back up its claim. In fact, just this week, Google said it had “closed the gender pay gap globally.” A battle with the government could be costly. Google has faced substantial government regulation in Europe, but has mostly been able to avoid the same scrutiny in the U.S. because of its positive reputation. A battle over pay gaps, however, could begin to erode that good will. Big Picture: Google is in hot water with the federal government, after an agency official said in court that the company discriminates against women.

The legal defense, presented in documents filed Friday in San Francisco federal court, marks Uber’s first detailed response to explosive allegations that its self-driving cars rely on crucial technology designed by Waymo. That company was created from an autonomous-vehicle project started at Google eight years ago. Once a Google ally, Uber emerged as a rival in the self-driving car market in early 2015 when it began developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. Now, Waymo is trying to thwart that effort by persuading U.S. District Judge William Alsup to block Uber’s self-car driving expansion on the grounds that it hinges on a high-tech heist. The case’s outcome could alter the race to build self-driving cars that may transform transportation, reduce traffic deaths and launch a huge new industry. Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. After the alleged theft, Mr. Levandowski left Google early last year to found a self-driving car startup called Otto that Uber bought for $680 million last August. But Uber is now presenting evidence that it began working on technology dramatically different from Waymo’s more than a year before buying Otto. The dispute centers on a pivotal part of self-driving cars called LiDAR, an array of laser-based sensors that enable self-driving cars to see what’s around them so they can safely navigate roads. In sworn declarations and diagrams, Uber argued that its engineers are working on a more sophisticated form of LiDAR than Waymo’s. Among other things, Uber says its LiDAR uses four lenses for transmitting and receiving laser lights as opposed to the single lens in Waymo’s version. “Waymo could not be more wrong, and Uber’s design could not be more different,” Uber’s lawyers wrote in their rebuttal to the allegations. “And no wonder — Uber’s LiDAR was developed by a different team, using a different beam pattern, and leveraging different know-how.” What’s more, Uber says its custom-designed LiDAR system hasn’t even been installed on the self-driving cars that it has been testing in Pittsburgh, Arizona and San Francisco. Instead, the company says it has been relying on LiDAR systems built by other vendors. Much of the information contained in Friday’s filing was redacted to protect confidential business plans and secret technology. Uber may have its work cut out to sway Judge Alsup, who has said in previous court hearings that Waymo has presented some of the strongest evidence he has seen in his judicial career. A hearing on Waymo’s request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for May 3. Although Waymo isn’t suing him in this case, Mr. Levandowski will play a central role in how the lawsuit unfolds. Mr. Levandowski helped establish Google as an early leader in self-driving cars, earning him more than $120 million in incentive pay, according to information inadvertently revealed in court papers earlier this week. Before Mr. Levandowski defected from Google early last year start Otto, Waymo alleges he downloaded more than 14,000 documents containing trade secrets that are now helping Uber. After buying Otto, Uber put Mr. Levandowski in charge of Uber’s self-driving project, a job that has been imperiled by this lawsuit. Judge Alsup has warned that he may issue an order barring Mr. Levandowski from involvement in Uber’s self-driving car division if he sides with Waymo. Uber says it hasn’t found any evidence of ever possessing any of the files that Mr. Levandowski stands accused of stealing. Mr. Levandowski, meanwhile, has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to protect himself if criminal charges are filed against him.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!!

Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it.

Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Google’s underpayment of women is ‘systemic’, say Feds Kristen Bellstrom, Fortune April 7, 2017 8:44 PM Tags: department of labor, gender inequality, Google, pay gap, top-stories Above: Google logo Image Credit: Carlos Luna The U.S. government is charging that Google is systematically paying women less than their male counterparts. Testifying in a San Francisco court Friday, Department of Labor (DOL) regional director Janette Wipper said the government “found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” according to a report in The Guardian. The charges come as part of a lawsuit the DOL filed against Google in January, seeking access to the company’s compensation data and related personnel records. As a federal contractor, Google is required to permit the government to inspect records relevant to its compliance with equal opportunity laws. The DOL alleges that Google refused to provide the required information, while the company says it turned over “hundreds of thousands” of records and that the government’s requests are “overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data,” according to TechCrunch. In opening remarks, Lisa Barnett Sween, a Google attorney, called the DOL request a “fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review.” A Google spokesperson provided Fortune with the following statement: “We vehemently disagree with Ms. Whipper’s claim. Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” The accusations come after Google’s Tuesday announcement on Equal Pay Day that it has “closed the gender pay gap globally.” Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today → https://t.co/KTuGTJMV16 pic.twitter.com/rBciSK21uF — Google (@Google) April 4, 2017 The company also said that it’s “sharing some of the lessons we’ve learned to help other businesses close the gap.” As noted by The Guardian, this isn’t the first time the government has sued a large tech company over employment and pay issues. In January, the DOL sued Oracle over alleged pay discrimination against female and minority employees. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm.

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0.

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares170 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu has led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? thespacecowboy Network ads are only on shows you've recorded yourself. Google ads are on the on-demand stuff, Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks. Carson Saldanha ?` Shawn Spring I'm hoping this and Nick Jr (for the kiddos) comes sooner rather than later! freshprince_87 I hope they add it soon Lateef Alabi-Oki I think the nailed the user interface.

Tucker Sferro $35 is outrageous. You might as well jest get cable. Jacob Fulbright After you add in YouTube Red, Netflix, Hulu (or the ad-free premium Hulu), HBO GO, etc., yeah, cable isn't looking so bad anymore. Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either Naxx ENVY 1) some services don't allow you to share with other people and is considered a breach of contract 2) i get what he's saying, we have to have 5-6 differernt contracts to watch shows when cable covers it all not sure i like how its all going tbh, its going to end up being more expensive to have the same channels. .. just the illusion of choice BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings abc Cable eats up your data cap? Lateef Alabi-Oki I don't have a data cap. Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af Brandon Giesing My family switched from AT&T to Charter Spectrum (before the whole Spectrum branding became a thing) because AT&T had around a 150 GB per month cap and once you hit that you had to pay like $20 extra to add 40 more GB. With 4 people constantly streaming music and video, downloading apps and Linux distros, and much more; we not only hit that every month but had to pay the extra $20 3-5 times every month. Our bills was like $300+ a month (Internet and Phone, not counting the separate expensive TV bill which was either DirecTV or DISH) Geoff Johnson Be glad you don't have Comcast, they have a 1TB cap. Malachi Jones Damn, here in the UK we have some providers offering £14.99/month internet only deals, super cheap in comparison to $99/month! Geoff Johnson What's the speed at 14.99/mo? thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. thespacecowboy The mobile access is huge. I think the other suppliers limit what you can watch on mobile, whereas with YouTube it's baked right in to the product offering. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Shawn Medeiros Get a HDTV antenna. You can get those right over the air free in much of the us. thespacecowboy Yeah. We did this about 18 months ago and use a Tivo OTA with lifetime service. Shame there are not more OTA channels. I'm going to attempt cable card but its not easy (the bracket is there but not the full thing which has to be bought separately). Geoff Johnson Do you have any idea how much cable TV actually costs? Tucker Sferro yes - after cutting the cord I receive about 1 letter per week from Fios begging me to come back, with basic packages starting around $29/mo. Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader Bruce Wayne Calm down. Android TV will come in due time. It's a new service. It's not even available nationwide yet. Midnitte Hopefully it exists once it launches nationally, but it's really silly they dont yet have an Android *TV* app for their *TV* service. Zachary Dunn Android TV should be a key feature of their TV offering. Not having it at launch is ridiculous. Not to mention, Youtube Gaming has been out for over a year and still doesn't have Android TV support, which is odd since Android TV is a platform built for streaming and gaming. Play Music on Android TV hasn't received any features released in the last year. Everytime Google releases a tv app without Android TV support, ppl say just wait for it, but it never happens or is half assed. KChristainsen you would think this is a no brainier to have an app for ATV. Just ridiculous. YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. thespacecowboy If you like that, check out George Clark's Amazing Spaces. It's on UK Channel 4 but likely available elsewhere. http://www.channel4.com/programmes/george-clarkes-amazing-spaces cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature thespacecowboy Only on things you recorded yourself, not on demand. Geoff Johnson Hulu doesn't have live TV. tim242 We were not talking about live TV. AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. DirkBelig Well that blows. Ramon Very. The only one that came close to this support is DirectTV Now. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. Geoff Johnson Then stream the 1080p version John Doe Hi, have you meet Netflix? Also, there is the choice I am not saying Google should force everyone's stream to the highest resolution (They don't even do that now, there is auto select). FYI, HDR has nothing to do with 4K and it actually does not add much to a the bandwidth requirement (Netflix said it adds 2.5MB/s compared to 12MB/s for 4K) Lars Jeppesen Do the channels even broadcast in 1080p or 4K? Box Most slim bundles and IPTV setups are only available in 720p at this time. YouTube TV is not alone in this. John Doe Most do in 1080i and I only have one 4K channel through Dish Network. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! PhantomGamers For sure you'll only get the channels that Google has agreements with, I doubt they're just grabbing up every OTA signal and streaming that. thespacecowboy It's going to depend on market. But I have many PBS on my Tivo, but none on my Youtube TV. Any device that has Chromecast should work. Some at the moment don't seem to work though (such as some Vizio TVs). After you pay for your 2nd month (after trial) they will send you a free Chromecast anyway. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. hp-fourtwenty no, you have the option to record all games of any team you select, which also adds it as a recommendation when you log in. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. Lars Jeppesen No hp-fourtwenty 50 live channels, and this is the first time I've been able to watch a New York Rangers game online without needing a traditional cable package or watching a pirated stream. I'm happy to pay only $35...especially since I already pay $10 for GPMAA/red thespacecowboy Isn't GPMAA on top of the $35? hp-fourtwenty yup, plus yt red exclusive programming...just no ad free yt red....and strangely no yttv background playback DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams. Acquire more channels. Lars Jeppesen People still watch MTV? Geoff Johnson Of course... Dirty Dave http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_youtube-tv2-768x432.jpg Im in the UK so this article is pointless for me, but what keyboard is this though Ryan? Ryan Definitely interesting. Ill hold off until college ball is back on, I only really care about OTA and ESPNs, so they have that advantage. sloheim "For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord" Wrong, wrong, for the love of god, WRONG. No NHL Network, NFL Network, or MLB Network or NBA TV. Anti-sports. Box Does the "three active streams" restriction include on-demand and recordings? Ben Nicholls Not too interested unless the provide more package options, or a la carte packages. Part of the reason I cut the cord was to stop paying for channels I don't watch. I would like to see at minimum a "no sports" package. ESPN is one of the most expensive channels and I don't like paying for it in a package when I don't watch it. An AndroidTV app is also a must. BinaryTB Google's Family Group system? Sounds like it won't support Google Apps for Work for people that actually pay Google already for their own domain. Add it to the list: Google Fi Google Play Music Family Plan Google Play Apps Family Sharing DirkBelig >"There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo." And what's preventing anyone from simply subscribing to HBO NOW or bundling Showtime or Starz for $9 with their Amazon Prime package? Anyone who would get this probably has a Netflix account and app, so I don't understand what the beef is here having to a la carte HBO other than it breaks the cable channel grid paradigm. #FirstWorldProblems thespacecowboy +ing a show also adds any on-demand shows to your library. Downside is those ones have ads, like Hulu. TV guide is frustrating. You can't easily see past the current show and the next one. EPG is weird. You can click on the channel name and then browse that actual channel, but not in a grid style. hp-fourtwenty Yes, we need a good epg severely!! Lex Lybrand It's not available on Android TV. That's a day-1 must-have. Sean McGeezer I'll wait for Cartoon Network at the very least, though it may not happen Terry Sanchez It does not have the Cooking channel and is lacking many channels. I hope this improves over time. SlingTV is still better right now. JG Is it steam only? Or can one pin content to their devices for local/offline play? Then I could​ save a recording or two to watch on my (non-driving) commute without having to worry about adding to much to my monthly bill at $10/gig. Or maybe save something for longer than the 9 month period. Google's Play Movie/TV app allows it, as does the new light weight version of YouTube being beta'd in India now. Netflix and Showtime do to... I would assume if they can do it, why not also YouTube TV? thespacecowboy No download option at the moment. Iamsecond Blah blah blah, thanks for more US-only features YouTube, glad to see you're working hard on this when you haven't even launched YouTube Red in the UK yet. Yep, thanks.

Google rolling out a new look for sign-in, deprecating old methods Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:30am PDTApr 7, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 159 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares244 Development Google News Starting on April 10th Google plans on pushing out an update to the sign-in page for Google accounts. This change is meant to further unify the sign-in process across your various devices. Although the news was posted to the G Suite Developers blog, we do fully expect this change to affect all Google accounts on all browsers, mobile browsers, and iOS apps (Android apps should not be affected). Google's SSO will also see additional changes beyond the purely cosmetic, as a new permissions grant redirect will be added to the login process, and permissions requested by a site or service will be more explicitly stated. The privacy-conscious will be excited to hear that Google is making such an effort to ensure a greater awareness on the part of users when it comes to privacy and consent in the use of third party services. Unfortunately, the permission request pane will no longer list what Google considers to be "standard" permission requests, presumably including basic account information. At least Google is making some effort to increase privacy awareness during login, even going so far as to increase the burden of responsibility for that privacy on developers by requiring contact information to be listed at a link on the permissions page. These aren't the only changes to login Google will be making. The use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe after April 20th, so if you are a developer relying on a webview redirect for OAuth to grant permissions you should consider changing to the official methods very soon before it breaks. Even some large companies like Airbnb and Pocket still haven't updated to the new methods, so it's worth taking a look. The rollout for the new sign-in is expected to be quite extended, potentially requiring more than two weeks for full visibility, so don't be surprised if you don't notice any changes to your sign-in process for a while. Most people probably won't notice much of a change beyond the cosmetic, anyway (although, our readers certainly aren't most people).

Thanks. Matt I'm sure this was first hinted at during the last Google IO... or possibly earlier. Every time I had to login since hearing that announcement I lost my shit wondering what was taking so long. Josh Crumley Of all the companies out there taking our personal data and using it for profit, Google is by far the least secretive about it. I'm glad they're making the permissions more detailed. Pixelexel I don't trust any company with my data other than Google. Kanoosh i don't even really trust google , but they are the least worst imo so i i go with them. :) HSidhu Google won't give your data to anyone, your Data is their power. Kanoosh never assume just because someone tells you something , that it is true.. i still hold plenty of caution with google as should everyone else.. no tin foil hats here, just reality of things... but i do hold them in higher regard for my personal data then any others , just always good to be safe. catalysto It's not just because "someone said so". It's because if Google was ever caught actually selling/releasing user data, they'd be completely screwed. Their entire business model depends on them keeping your data private.

Devin Rodriguez Oh, okay. abc But which is the fastyest? BC This is interesting and I do like the the fact that the permissions are highlighted more than they were before. This is a good thing indeed! Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe Thank god. I absolutely hate apps that do that for Google / Facebook / Twitter permission request. If the first party app is installed, popup permission request screen on those apps. Don't load a webview asking me to login with email, password, 2FA. I wish FB and Twitter will also do what Google is doing now. Drunk Squirrel Like how titanium backup opens a webview of Google sign in in order to backup to Google drive, as opposed to other apps which show up a single pop-up,, correct Ryne Hager Right? They've got libraries for that, why make me enter my information again on a device I'm already logged in on? Imagine all the time that could have been saved. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I didn't even mention "save this new browser?" screen and "logged in from a new machine" emails that those webview logins cause.

US regulators accuse Google of underpaying female workers Associated Press | 0 comments SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees have accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," Google said in its statement. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 percent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labor Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

This week, the judge presiding over the civil case said he might just grant Google’s request for a preliminary injunction, which could force Uber to rein in or even stop testing its robocar technology testing until the case is resolved. Eager to avoid the worst, Uber issued a response designed to limit the damage. All of this started in February when Waymo, Google’s autonomous vehicle division, filed a lawsuit claiming former employee Anthony Levandowski downloaded 14,000 technical files from a company server and used the info to launch his autonomous truck startup  Otto. Uber acquired Otto a few months later and put Levandowski in charge of its autonomous vehicle program. Uber calls the suit “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” Uber v. Waymo Aarian Marshall A Simple Theory for Uber’s Waymo Mess: Plain Old Sloppiness Alex Davies Google’s Lawsuit Against Uber Revolves Around Frickin’ Lasers Aarian Marshall Google Tries to Run Uber Off the Road—in Court Finding itself on the defensive, Uber fired back Friday with a laundry list of reasons why the judge should deny Waymo’s request for an injunction. The company’s lawyers claim they haven’t found any of those 14,000 documents on company computers, and they say Uber started developing its lidar system before Levandowski came aboard. And they insist Uber’s lidar unit uses a totally different design. “Waymo’s preliminary injunction motion is a misfire,” they wrote in their argument against the injunction. Still, they’ve made no effort to defend Levandowski, who is not named in the suit. The engineer retained his own counsel and has exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. For those reasons, Uber’s lawyers say, they do not know whether he stole anything from Waymo, or what might have become of any data Waymo claims went missing. “I think it’s effective in terms of what they’re trying to do,” says Courtland Reichman, a lawyer with the firm McKool Smith who works on intellectual property cases. “They’re trying to contain it and do damage control.” Damage control is an apt description here, because everything suggests the judge favors granting the injunction. “If all you can show is that you can’t find [the allegedly stolen documents] in your files, there’s going to be a preliminary injunction of some sort. It can’t be helped,” Judge William Alsup told Uber’s lawyers this week. “This is an extraordinary case. I have never seen a record this strong in 42 years. So you are up against it.” It is uncommon to see a judge so openly willing to grant an injunction before trial, but then, this entire case is uncommon. “This case is unusual because the opening evidence offered by the plaintiff was so compelling,” says Michael Brophy, a lawyer with Withers Worldwide who works on commercial litigation and IP cases. “There’s so much evidence that could only explain wrongdoing.” Related Video Uber’s Self-Driving Truck Delivers 50,000 Beers And so, if Uber’s lawyers can’t ward off the injunction, they must try to limit its reach. Waymo asked the court to bar Uber from using its lidar sensor system and any other tech it claims Uber built using stolen knowledge. Such a move would limit Uber’s ability to develop technology it deems essential to its long-term viability. And the judge may not go that far. “The court is going to want to impose the narrowest injunction that makes sense,” Brophy says. Alsup has suggested he might ban Levandowski from working on Uber’s robocar program until the case is resolved. No company wants to lose its star engineer, but that’s better than hobbling your program—or halting it altogether.

That’s the key takeaway from a new report that finds Ford—yes, the Detroit-based, 113-year-old giant—is winning the race to build the self-driving car, with General Motors running a close second. Renault-Nissan, Daimler, and Volkswagen round out the top five. Meanwhile, Waymo—aka Google’s driverless car effort—sits in sixth place, with Tesla in twelfth. Uber languishes in sixteenth, behind Honda and barely ahead of startup Nutonomy and China’s Baidu. That may sound all kinds of wrong to anyone who has seen Uber, Waymo, and Tesla flaunt their tech, and regards Detroit’s old guard as ill-prepared for the robotic future. But it’s the state of the race according to Navigant Research, whose newly released “leaderboard” report ranks these players not just on their ability to make a car drive itself, but on their ability to bring that car to the mass market. “The technology is great, but unless you can build tens of thousands of cars and get people in those cars, it’s not really all that useful,” says Navigant’s Sam Abuelsamid, who wrote the report with David Alexander and Lisa Jerram. The report selected the 18 biggest companies pursuing fully driverless cars, and ranked them based on nine criteria, including tech, go-to-market strategy, production prowess, staying power, and sales, marketing, and distribution. Navigant Research Ford and GM both score in the low to mid 80s on the technology front; it’s their old-school skills that float them to first and second place. They’ve each spent more than a century developing, testing, producing, marketing, distributing, and selling cars. Plus, each has made strategic moves to bolster weak points. Ford just dumped a billion dollars into an artificial intelligence outfit. It acquired ride-sharing service Chariot and invested in Velodyne, a company producing lidar, the laser scanning tech many argue is necessary for self-driving cars. GM scooped up self-driving expertise via a startup called Cruise, and partnered with Lyft to put the eventual result on the road. Waymo, by comparison, scores top marks for technology but drags in the production strategy and sales, marketing, and distribution buckets. The company plans to work with legacy automakers to put its tech in cars, but has not yet struck any major deals. “They have almost every piece of this—except the product strategy,” says Abuelsamid. Ford fully autonomous Fusion Hybrid research vehicle on streets of Dearborn, Michigan.The Ford Motor Company Despite Uber’s high-profile self-driving pilots in Pittsburgh, Tempe, Arizona, and San Francisco, the company wallows near last place thanks to low grades for distribution, product portfolio, and staying power—and  because makes Uber makes neither cars nor money. In fact, its key strength—that it already operates a global fleet of shared vehicles—may not be enough here. “It’s a lot easier for the company that actually has the infrastructure to create vehicles to recreate what Uber’s done, than the other way around,” Abuelsamid says. The Race to Autonomy Alex Davies Nissan’s Path to Self-Driving Cars? Humans in Call Centers Jack Stewart As Self-Driving Cars Approach, the Auto Industry Races to Rebuild Alex Davies The Numbers Don’t Lie: Self-Driving Cars Are Getting Good Tesla sits in the middle. It’s strong on “vision” (that’s Elon Musk for you) and go-to-market strategy (it’s already offering semi-autonomous cars). But Navigant knocks Tesla on staying power (it’s a young player in a brutal industry), sales, marketing, and distribution (Tesla can’t operate in every state), and technology (because Musk won’t use the expensive lidar tech experts say is necessary for full autonomy). Now, this report comes with a whopper of a caveat: These are early days in a race that will unfold over years, if not decades. Every company listed could shore up its weaknesses with smart partnerships or acquisitions, and jump to the front of the pack. Ford ranked sixth in the 2015 version of this study; Uber wasn’t on it at all. “These [results] are by no means final,” Abuelsamid says. Ranking may one day change, but they serve as a reminder that it takes more than clever tech to change the world—and that muscle still matters. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Aarian Marshall Transportation Date of Publication: 03.17.17. 03.17.17 Time of Publication: 7:39 pm. 7:39 pm A Simple Theory for Uber’s Waymo Mess: Plain Old Sloppiness Operation staff at Otto climb into the cab of a self-driving big-rig truck during a demonstration at the Otto headquarters in San Francisco. Tony Avelar/AP The allegations are spicy, the insinuations downright fiery. In a lawsuit filed last month in San Francisco, Google’s autonomous vehicle spinoff Waymo accuses former engineer Anthony Levandowski of stealing 14,000 pages of intellectual property and trade secrets, then using them to launch his robotruck startup, Otto. Just four months later, Uber acquired Otto for a reported $680 million—and that, Waymo alleges, is how the ride-hailing giant started using Google’s vital circuit board and sensor setup in its own self-driving cars. Some folks, reading between the lines of the lawsuit, see a conspiracy: Perhaps Uber directly conspired with Levandowski to steal Google’s self-driving secrets. ‘It’s so dangerous to be hiring a very knowledgeable former employee of another company and put him in a position in your company to do the same thing.’ As seductive as you may find this narrative, there may be a far simpler explanation, one grounded in Uber’s storied history of gleefully breaking rules. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that Waymo’s central allegation is true: Levandowski downloaded the documents, and Uber used Google smarts in its own sensor designs. If so, the mess embroiling Uber may stem not from a conspiracy among evil geniuses, but a brash disregard for standard operating procedure. Sound familiar? How to Acquire a Startup—the Smart Way If Uber followed best practices, its deep dive into Otto’s tech would have started well before it finalized the purchase. An invading team of crack technical and legal experts would have created a “data room”—sometimes physical, sometimes virtual—where they might have pawed through documents to guarantee Levandowski’s Otto was legit. “For many companies, their assets are patents or intellectual property, so there’s a lot of due diligence in reviewing those,” says Manita Rawat, a patent attorney with the law firm Duane Morris. Job number one: Ensuring the technology you’re paying bank for doesn’t actually belong to someone else. Waymo vs Uber Aarian Marshall Google Tries to Run Uber Off the Road—in Court Alex Davies Uber’s Massive Crap Pile Develops Its Own Gravity Alex Davies Google’s Lawsuit Against Uber Revolves Around Frickin’ Lasers Alex Davies Google Accuses Uber of Stealing Its Self-Driving Car Tech Easier said than done. The world of patents is wide, and it can be difficult to spot infringement or lifted trade secrets on the fly. But any Uber team looking into Otto should have been extra sensitive to the weird optics of buying a new startup for hundreds of millions just a few months after its founder left the leading self-driving outfit. “It would seem obvious to ask the question: ‘How was that technology developed and how do you give me as a buyer comfort that we’re not going to find ourselves in a dispute?'” says attorney Mark Seneca, a mergers and acquisitions specialist at the law firm Orrick. If Uber had done that—and it might have!—it should have little trouble defending itself against allegations that it stole IP. (“We will have a chance to tell our side of the story in upcoming filings and look forward to that opportunity,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement.) Uber also ought to have done some digging on Otto’s employees. A smart firm looking to buy a company will know which workers are coming from which companies, and the potential conflicts of interest those associations could create. If you’re about to hire someone with serious know-how on tech you’re trying a crack, you want to take precautions to guarantee she doesn’t pass on any secrets—even by mistake. “It’s so dangerous to be hiring a very knowledgeable former employee of another company and put him in a position in your company to do the same thing,” says Courtland Reichman, a trial lawyer at law firm McKool Smith who litigates trade secret and patent infringement cases. How do you make sure an acqui-hire doesn’t contribute even inadvertently stolen info to your own self-driving unit? You start by making him sign a contract saying he won’t, to protect the company if something goes awry. But that alone isn’t enough to guarantee a firm won’t be found liable for infringement or theft in court. Even smarter: You create a firewall between the secret-laden employee and the team working on the tech. You instruct them to not communicate with each other. You physically or technologically deny the employee access to vital documents or servers dealing with that tech. And you document it all, in writing. “You’d want to have a record that, if you got sued, will establish that you independently created the technology,” says Reichman. It is, of course, very possible that Uber did all this meticulous work, and defending itself against Waymo’s charges will be a snap. (The dispute is ongoing, with a next hearing set for late April.) In the messy world of startups and fast-developing tech, things can go wrong, and blunders can be well-meaning. But in the messy world of startups and fast-developing tech, things can go wrong, and blunders can be well-meaning. “Issues come up, and companies learn—we all learn from our mistakes,” says Rawat, the patent attorney. Still, Silicon Valley also has a long history of being loosey-goosey with rules, a culture that prizes acting now and begging for forgiveness later—just ask Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Under his leadership, the company made its name on a cavalier attitude toward red tape and regulations—when it aggressively pushed its way around taxi commissions in new markets, when it used a specialized program to dodge regulators, and when it launched self-driving passenger service in San Francisco without a permit. A slapdash approach to a big acquisition doesn’t sound like a stretch. For other tech companies, this dispute might plant a much-needed “DANGER” sign. “Cases like this are so important for understanding trade secrets and the devaluation of intellectual property, so people see what’s right and wrong,” says Reichman. It’s tempting to see conspiracy, especially when the stakes are so high—if Uber really did conspire to steal Waymo tech, there could be grounds for criminal economic espionage charges and expensive compensation. But for Uber, a potent mix of sloppiness and arrogance could be just as costly. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Autonomous Vehicles corporate espionage google Uber Skip Social.

And the firm, which said in a statement it disagrees “vehemently” with the allegation, is fighting hard to keep the agency’s eyes off its salary data, according to a pre-hearing filing by the Labor Department. “The most prominent issue at the hearing will be whether Google, the eighth-most-profitable business in the entire country, can prove it will face an unconstitutional undue burden in supplying information relevant to determining whether it has complied with non-discrimination obligations,” the filing said. “Google is in an extremely poor position to demonstrate any burden or hardship for at least five reasons.” First, Google would bear no real burden in coughing up the data, because the agency offered to “extract” it from source records, according to the department. Second, even if it cost what Google said it would to produce the information, that would only be .0024 percent of the firm’s 2016 operating costs, and anyway, Google reps had said many times that many of the requested items, such as job and salary history, were “readily available in Google’s electronic databases,” the agency said. Third, Google committed to complying with federal law “when it sought and obtained a five-year contract the company valued to be worth $25 million in taxpayer funds,” according to the department. Fourth, Google has received plenty more money from the feds than it would cost to come up with the information demanded, the agency said. Last, Google, with “great public fanfare,” has announced a $150 million diversity plan, and, “given this spending, Google cannot now plead poverty as a basis for denying access to an entity charged, on the public’s behalf, with determining whether Google complies with its basic non-discrimination obligations.” On the agency’s allegations about discrimination, Google said in a statement, “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. “Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the (Department of Labor) hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.”   Photo: Technology workers are seen outside a Google office building (Bay Area News Group) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Department of Labor, Google, labor department   More Posts in 1 Google’s former self-driving car boss Chris Urmson raises millions for startup while facing Tesla lawsuit April 6, 2017   Yahoo, with Finance and Sports, will live on after Verizon sale, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says April 5, 2017   Yahoo and AOL to get odd new name, questionable logo April 3, 2017       Share this Post Tweet       comcast router ip Nice step from Google.         Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts H-1B visa program maxed out after four days Ford ahead of Uber, Google, Tesla in self-driving car race,… A longtime Twitter board member is leaving Google fights disclosure of information about female… Yahoo, with Finance and Sports, will live on after Verizon…     Archives Archives Select Month April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital   About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM.

Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm.

Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

A government investigation into how much Google is paying its employees has uncovered a widespread pattern of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency’s allegations during a Friday, April 7, 2017, court hearing in San Francisco. Google says it vehemently disagrees with charges of sex discrimination. (Photo: Virginia Mayo / AP, file) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE San Francisco — Government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees have accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency’s allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn’t heard until Wipper’s court appearance. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” Google said in its statement. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 percent of Google’s technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google’s more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labor Department’s probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers’ privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

The legal defense, presented in documents filed Friday in San Francisco federal court, marks Uber’s first detailed response to explosive allegations that its self-driving cars rely on crucial technology designed by Waymo. That company was created from an autonomous-vehicle project started at Google eight years ago. Once a Google ally, Uber emerged as a rival in the self-driving car market in early 2015 when it began developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. Now, Waymo is trying to thwart that effort by persuading U.S. District Judge William Alsup to block Uber’s self-car driving expansion on the grounds that it hinges on a high-tech heist. The case’s outcome could alter the race to build self-driving cars that may transform transportation, reduce traffic deaths and launch a huge new industry. Laser Focus Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. After the alleged theft, Levandowski left Google early last year to found a self-driving car startup called Otto that Uber bought for $680 million last August. But Uber is now presenting evidence that it began working on technology dramatically different from Waymo’s more than a year before buying Otto. The dispute centers on a pivotal part of self-driving cars called LiDAR, an array of laser-based sensors that enable self-driving cars to see what’s around them so they can safely navigate roads. In sworn declarations and diagrams, Uber argued that its engineers are working on a more sophisticated form of LiDAR than Waymo’s. Among other things, Uber says its LiDAR uses four lenses for transmitting and receiving laser lights as opposed to the single lens in Waymo’s version. “Waymo could not be more wrong, and Uber’s design could not be more different,” Uber’s lawyers wrote in their rebuttal to the allegations. “And no wonder — Uber’s LiDAR was developed by a different team, using a different beam pattern, and leveraging different know-how.” Weight Of Evidence What’s more, Uber says its custom-designed LiDAR system hasn’t even been installed on the self-driving cars that it has been testing in Pittsburgh, Arizona and San Francisco. Instead, the company says it has been relying on LiDAR systems built by other vendors. Much of the information contained in Friday’s filing was redacted to protect confidential business plans and secret technology. Uber may have its work cut out to sway Alsup, who has said in previous court hearings that Waymo has presented some of the strongest evidence he has seen in his judicial career. A hearing on Waymo’s request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for May 3. Although Waymo isn’t suing him in this case, Levandowski will play a central role in how the lawsuit unfolds. Levandowski helped establish Google as an early leader in self-driving cars, earning him more than $120 million in incentive pay, according to information inadvertently revealed in court papers earlier this week. Before Levandowski defected from Google early last year start Otto, Waymo alleges he downloaded more than 14,000 documents containing trade secrets that is now helping Uber. After buying Otto, Uber put Levandowski in charge of Uber’s self-driving project, a job that has been imperiled by this lawsuit. Alsup has warned that he may issue an order barring Levandowski from involvement in Uber’s self-driving car division if he sides with Waymo. Uber says it hasn’t found any evidence of ever possessing any of the files that Levandowski stands accused of stealing. Levandowski, meanwhile, has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to protect himself if criminal charges are filed against him. CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM.

More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm.

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

Google rolling out a new look for sign-in, deprecating old methods Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:30am PDTApr 7, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 159 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares244 Development Google News Starting on April 10th Google plans on pushing out an update to the sign-in page for Google accounts. This change is meant to further unify the sign-in process across your various devices. Although the news was posted to the G Suite Developers blog, we do fully expect this change to affect all Google accounts on all browsers, mobile browsers, and iOS apps (Android apps should not be affected). Google's SSO will also see additional changes beyond the purely cosmetic, as a new permissions grant redirect will be added to the login process, and permissions requested by a site or service will be more explicitly stated. The privacy-conscious will be excited to hear that Google is making such an effort to ensure a greater awareness on the part of users when it comes to privacy and consent in the use of third party services. Unfortunately, the permission request pane will no longer list what Google considers to be "standard" permission requests, presumably including basic account information. At least Google is making some effort to increase privacy awareness during login, even going so far as to increase the burden of responsibility for that privacy on developers by requiring contact information to be listed at a link on the permissions page. These aren't the only changes to login Google will be making. The use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe after April 20th, so if you are a developer relying on a webview redirect for OAuth to grant permissions you should consider changing to the official methods very soon before it breaks. Even some large companies like Airbnb and Pocket still haven't updated to the new methods, so it's worth taking a look. The rollout for the new sign-in is expected to be quite extended, potentially requiring more than two weeks for full visibility, so don't be surprised if you don't notice any changes to your sign-in process for a while. Most people probably won't notice much of a change beyond the cosmetic, anyway (although, our readers certainly aren't most people).

Thanks. Matt I'm sure this was first hinted at during the last Google IO... or possibly earlier. Every time I had to login since hearing that announcement I lost my shit wondering what was taking so long. Josh Crumley Of all the companies out there taking our personal data and using it for profit, Google is by far the least secretive about it. I'm glad they're making the permissions more detailed. Pixelexel I don't trust any company with my data other than Google. Kanoosh i don't even really trust google , but they are the least worst imo so i i go with them. :) HSidhu Google won't give your data to anyone, your Data is their power. Kanoosh never assume just because someone tells you something , that it is true.. i still hold plenty of caution with google as should everyone else.. no tin foil hats here, just reality of things... but i do hold them in higher regard for my personal data then any others , just always good to be safe. catalysto It's not just because "someone said so". It's because if Google was ever caught actually selling/releasing user data, they'd be completely screwed. Their entire business model depends on them keeping your data private.

Devin Rodriguez Oh, okay. abc But which is the fastyest? BC This is interesting and I do like the the fact that the permissions are highlighted more than they were before. This is a good thing indeed! Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe Thank god. I absolutely hate apps that do that for Google / Facebook / Twitter permission request. If the first party app is installed, popup permission request screen on those apps. Don't load a webview asking me to login with email, password, 2FA. I wish FB and Twitter will also do what Google is doing now. Drunk Squirrel Like how titanium backup opens a webview of Google sign in in order to backup to Google drive, as opposed to other apps which show up a single pop-up,, correct Ryne Hager Right? They've got libraries for that, why make me enter my information again on a device I'm already logged in on? Imagine all the time that could have been saved. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I didn't even mention "save this new browser?" screen and "logged in from a new machine" emails that those webview logins cause.

NEW YORK, NY - April 7, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- Notable expert in reputation management, IC Media Direct studies the immense effect a vigorous online brand has on the overall quality of organizational performance and individual positioning alike. Online reputation control is increasingly vital in the 21st Century as more companies understand the importance of focusing on their digital footprint. Rising above the competition is challenging, especially with the quick pace at which technology changes - and the pressure on businesses to keep up. Optimizing SEO is more fundamental now than it was towards the end of the 20th century, not long after Google launched. Ensuring positive content is in the number one spot is imperative, since 33 percent of people always click on the search engine's top result after inputting a word or term. IC Media Direct emphasizes that businesses and individuals should adapt to new ways of controlling their online reputation through a smart content management plan. In comparison to SEO, content marketing is a relatively new technique, but is also key for companies hoping to create a positive image. It allows firms to take full control of their branding by formulating a distinctive voice and a clear message through content - whether on websites, blogs, or social media platforms - while also promoting their products or services. Trust is key for attracting consumers, and content marketing cultivates a brand that seems reliable and likable while also boosting sales. IC Media Direct experts advise companies to choose wisely when it comes to connecting with their target customers, with a consistently multiplying array of social media channels to choose from. Teens are moving from sites like Facebook, for example, in favor of newer options like Snapchat and Instagram. With live-streaming apps set to excel in the years to come, digital natives are migrating to Periscope in striking numbers. With two decades of experience providing companies with the tools to achieve success, IC Media Direct has in-house staff trained in the latest technological and media advances to provide forward-thinking strategies for brands to utilize in the most effective manner. Founded in 1996, IC Media Direct is a full-service reputation management, marketing and public relations company. With offices in New York and Washington DC, the firm operates globally, serving a range of clients. Experts in formulating campaigns and navigating SEO, the company has generated effective online reputation management strategies for countless clients, including Olympic athletes, celebrities, politicians and Fortune 500 companies. A leading force within the industry, IC Media Direct is an award-winning firm and has been recognized repeatedly by the Small Business Institute for Excellence in Commerce.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM.

More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol.

Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Rudresh Please share some for the N7 2013 too, pretty please! R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Chris Smith, BGR Google and Nokia might finally make the Android phone fans are dying for Chris Smith @chris_writes April 7th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet HMD Global, the company that will sell Nokia-branded smartphones for the following ten years, has big plans. It aims to restore the Nokia brand to what it once was, and it thinks Google’s Android can help. But unlike other Android device makers that are all churning out the same black rectangles, the new Nokia has something else in mind. But it will only work with Google’s help. Don't Miss: Scientist studying acoustic vibrations decides to make life hell for some Lego dudes Nokia said during its press event at MWC that its Android phones, including the Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3 that are about to launch, will run a clean version of Android — or as close to vanilla Android as possible, the kind of Android OS some fans crave. Furthermore, Nokia said on stage that it plans to issue swift updates to Android, a feat no other smartphone maker can brag with. Talking to Gulf News, HMD Global’s vice president for the Middle East and North Africa Per Ekman reiterated some of those goals, revealing that Google might be the key to making Nokia great again. Apparently, HMD Global clinched some important strategic partnership with Foxconn and Google. “Most of the smartphones in the market do not have the Android OS in the way it should be,” the exec said. “Vendors are adding a skin on top of the OS. Consumers have the right to have the latest version of the OS, and we will be pushing the latest version and the patches as soon as it is available from Google.” “We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant,” he said. That sounds amazing, at least in theory. But running pure Android on a phone also sounds like something not even Google is doing anymore. For the first time since Android’s inception, Google last year confirmed that it wants to further customize its own Android smartphones. The Pixel that followed was a Prime example of that, sporting some features that were not initially available on older Nexus models. On the other hand, Google’s primary Android partner has just taken the first significant anti-Android move. Samsung’s Bixby is a direct competitor to Google’s Assistant and a potential threat to Google in the long run. Working closely with a company that can sell Nokia-branded Android phones, a brand still loved by millions of people, might be in Google’s best interest. HMD Global’s next major test comes soon. The first Nokia Android phones are tipped to launch in 120 markets in late May or early June.

On the surface, brands and marketers have become increasingly upset about ads running against controversial content on the video-streaming site. But beyond that, it provides a stark example to the ever-evolving question of ad placement. Can platforms ensure the placement of ads? How can brands and marketers prevent negative ad placement? What strategies can brands and marketers use to avoid issues in the future? DMN spoke with some of the leading organizations in the field to determine the best methods of approach to avoid the ad placement madness. The below are direct quotes from each individual. Jason Beckerman, CEO and Co-Founder at Unified The main driver of brand risk is programmatic display, brands should avoid this at all costs by procuring video from safer platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat—vs millions of sites which can lead to greater risk. First and foremost, leverage products that are curated, like ads with periscope where only certain channels publishers are allowed in. Brand should keep in mind that social mediums are built off identity—not cookies. Videos on social are contained in a feed and in their own frame, whereas YouTube was pre-rolled before unknown content— on social you own your block of inventory. Of course, you always run a risk of your ad showing up above or below another UGC item, but not before and associated with something risky. Carl Erik Kjærsgaard, CEO and co-founder at Blackwood Seven. The entire market place must agree on the terms for which they are trading and thereby commit to a shared understanding of cost, quality and time to market. It's all about trust. Each publisher must provide transparency about what content the ads will be shown against and take responsibility for ensuring the quality of these placements, at the price level they demand from the advertisers. And advertiser must be aware that price and quality are equal components when buying inventory. If advertisers demand low prices provide instantly, then quality will be as such. This is a shared obligation.” Marika Roque, VP of Digital Media Activation over Mass2 and Lin Digital at Nexstar Digital LLC  The uproar around Google's ad placement has forced brands to evaluate whether walled garden entities, like Google, are the most effective tools within which to publish. Google and partners like them have tremendous brand recognition and offer exclusive and custom executions, yet there can be a lot of risk involved. Walled gardens limit partners in terms of what types of content they can filter, and essentially, leads to a lack of transparency and the ability to target ideal audiences for brands. These partnerships can also create a conflict of interest where profits and scale are prioritized over brand safety and optimal performance. In an industry with ever-changing standards, remaining agile, staying hyper communicative, and utilizing reputable resources will help to foster safe advertising.  To do this, brands need to establish best practices with their partners that include clear communication, the ability to raise safety concerns, and the creation of a safety block list. By putting these methods in place, both parties can be aligned on what is considered acceptable and it will ensure that from the beginning, a campaign will be properly planned against a targeting strategy/KPI that accounts for any brand concerns. Brands should also purchase media through reputable companies which offer transparent practices, such as removing invalid traffic from billable units, instead of going for the cheapest bid. Oftentimes pushing agencies and networks to lower their rates can compromise traffic quality and risks brand safety. Utilizing internal tools such as whitelists,  as well as brand safety tools and third party measurement companies, such as Integral Ad Science or DoubleVerify, will prevent ads from serving next to unsafe content and ensure any unwanted publishers are blocked. Lastly, staying up to speed with industry standards and updating best practices as often as the industry changes will be crucial for success. Nels Stromborg, EVP at Retale The biggest and best tool any brand can employ is actually getting in the middle of your media buys. You have to understand how the media is sourced, the technology behind the execution, and the verification tools and methodologies your agency or partner is suggesting you use. That is frankly a lot of work. Simple things like the practice of “white labeling” site lists can help you a lot. You can go back to buying media directly with highly respected publishers, and environments that focus on engagement vs. pure clicks. Using the right verification tools, will help. Getting things in writing from any partner, will also help cut down on these issues, and lastly adopting a policy of zero tolerance from both your media partners and agency partners will help a lot. However, it will never be foolproof. Every day people are working on ways to outsmart these algorithms and tools so that they can continue to profit from fraud. That is likely not going to change any time soon.

See Offers Business Posted April 7 Updated April 7 increase font size Google expands fact-checking to curb misleading news stories Observers say efforts by the search-engine titan will make it easier for users to discern between trustworthy reporting and 'fake news.' By ANICK JESDANUNAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — Google will expand the use of “fact check” tags in its search results – the tech industry’s latest effort to combat false and misleading news stories. People who search for a topic in Google’s main search engine or the Google News section will see a conclusion such as “mostly true” or “false” next to stories that have been fact checked. This photo shows a sign outside Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google will start offering "fact check" tags next to some news stories in search results in the tech industry's latest effort to combat false and misleading news stories, on Friday, April 7, 2017. People who search for a topic in the regular search engine or the Google News section will see a conclusion such as "mostly true" or "false" next to news stories that had been fact checked by one of more than 100 organizations, including The Associated Press, PolitiFact and Snopes.com. Associated Press/Marcio Jose Sanchez Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Google has been working with more than 100 news organizations and fact-checking groups, including The Associated Press, the BBC and NPR. Their conclusions will appear in search results as long as they meet certain formatting criteria for automation. Google said only a few of those organizations, including PolitiFact and Snopes.com, have already met those requirements; The Washington Post also says it complies. Google said it expects the ranks of compliant organizations to grow following Friday’s announcement. Not all news stories will be fact checked. Multiple organizations may reach different conclusions; Google will show those separately. Still unanswered is whether these fact-check analyses will sway people who are already prone to believe false reports because they confirm preconceived notions. Glenn Kessler, who writes “The Fact Checker” column at The Washington Post, said in an email that Google’s efforts should at least “make it easier for people around the world to obtain information that counters the spin by politicians and political advocacy groups, as well as purveyors of ‘fake news.”‘ He added that “over time, I expect that people increasingly will want to read a fact-check on a controversial issue or statement, even if the report conflicts with their political leanings.” Google started offering fact check tags in the U.S. and the U.K. in October and expanded the program to a handful of other countries in the subsequent months. Now the program is open to the rest of the world and to all languages. False news and misinformation, often masquerading as trustworthy news that spreads on social media, has gained attention since the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Google’s announcement comes a day after Facebook launched a resource to help users spot false news and misleading information that spreads on its service. The resource is basically a notification that pops up for a few days. Clicking on it takes people to tips and other information on how to spot false news and what to do about it.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM.

More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Latheryin You missed dirty unicorns which was the first to release 7.1.2 for the shamu. Also most of the bugs you mention are only in Rome based of LOS/CM. Rudresh Please share some for the N7 2013 too, pretty please! R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Patrick Kulp2017-04-08 01:16:35 UTC The Labor Department claimed Friday that Google has fostered an "extreme" gender pay gap across its entire workforce. The bombshell accusation stems from an ongoing investigation into the search giant's payroll practices, The Guardian first reported. It also comes three days after the company sang its own praises on Equal Pay Day. A department official testified in a San Francisco courtroom this week that enough "compelling evidence" had already been found to make a case for systemic discrimination. The agency first filed suit against Google in January in a bid to force the company to turn over salary data in accordance with anti-discrimination laws. SEE ALSO: This Uber executive sure sounds defensive about not taking the fall for Uber's harassment crisis “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry,” Labor Department regional director Janette Wipper said in court Friday, per The Guardian's report. The company claimed Tuesday that it had closed its gender pay gap worldwide in a tweet commemorating Equal Pay Day.   Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today → https://t.co/KTuGTJMV16 pic.twitter.com/rBciSK21uF — Google (@Google) April 4, 2017 The charge comes as reports of Uber's systemic sexism towards female employees have yet again thrown the tech industry's gender bias problems into sharp relief.  Men far outnumber women in Silicon Valley — particularly in lucrative technical jobs and positions of power — and a number of lawsuits and personal testimonies in recent years have pointed towards a slanted playing field that enforces that norm. But a full-fledged takedown at one of the biggest companies in the industry — and the world — could be explosive.  Google's latest diversity report revealed that only 31 percent of its employees are female. Women hold just one in five technical roles and a quarter of leadership posts. The Labor Department has been collecting salary information from Google since late 2015. The company was forthcoming with several of the requested data sets and, at one point, allowed regulators to interview employees at its Mountain View, California headquarters. But the company took issue with a follow-up order that called for detailed profiles of each employee, including prior job history and salaries, personal contact information, and competing offers, according to the tech law blog The Recorder. Google said in a statement at the time of the suit's filing that it refused the request because it was "overbroad in scope" and a breach of workers' privacy. A lawyer representing Google alleged during Friday's hearing that the request was a violation of Fourth Amendment rights, which protects citizens from unreasonable searches.   The company didn't immediately respond to our request for comment. The Labor Department is entitled to all of this information because Google is technically a federal contractor. The agency has asked the court to suspend all of the company's government contracts and bar it from any in the future if it doesn't comply.

The department has found "systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Labor Department Regional Director Janette Wipper testified in a court in San Francisco on Friday, according to a report by The Guardian. Janet Herold, the department's regional solicitor, told the Guardian that pay discrimination against women was extreme. Wipper said that the DoL found pay disparities in a snapshot of salaries from 2015, according to the Guardian. Wipper’s testimony was part of a hearing about a lawsuit that the Labor Department brought against Google to force the company to hand over salary information. The department is authorized to conduct audits of Google's employment practices because the company gets government contracts. It says Google hasn't been cooperating. The agency has asked the Office of Administrative Law Judges, a special court for Labor Department programs, to cancel all of Google’s government contracts and keep it from getting future contracts if it doesn’t comply with the request for data. Google vehemently disagrees with the department's assertion, the company said in an emailed statement. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” the statement read. “Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” At the time it filed the lawsuit, the Labor Department characterized the request for information as routine, but Google says the agency has cast too wide a net. (In a statement earlier this year, the company said it provided “hundreds of thousands of records” to the DoL as part of the audit.) That argument appears to hold some water for Steven Berlin, the administrative law judge overseeing the case. Last month, Berlin denied the DoL’s motion for summary judgment, which would have immediately concluded the case in its favor. He said the department's request for the data was "unreasonably burdensome, given its extremely limited relevance." The reported testimony on Friday came three days after Google said in a tweet that it had “closed the gender pay gap globally.” The company also published a guide to doing the same at other companies.

Its latest measure involves blocking ads from appearing on channels with less than 10,000 total views. According to what Google recently told the Wall Street Journal, it has been working on putting this measure in place since November. At first it was designed to prevent channels which steal content from earning revenue on the YouTube platform, but now the company faces an even greater problem. Several top US brands have pulled their advertising from YouTube after ads were found appearing next to controversial videos. Now it’s clear Google doesn’t want to give just anyone the ability to display ads on their YouTube content, which is pretty much what it was doing before. Prior to this measure being put in place, it was rather easy to get approved to display ads on a YouTube channel. It didn’t matter how old or reputable the channel was, or how many views its videos had. With the new 10,000 view threshold, Google is banking on the idea that questionable and/or controversial videos will not find a wide audience — and therefore ads will not end up appearing on channels publishing the content. Whether or not this will appease the brands that recently pulled their ads from YouTube remains to be seen. At the very least, Google is staying true to its word that it will put measures in place to prevent ads from appearing next to unsavory content.

A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," Google said in its statement. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

For instance, only 19 percent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labor Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs.

(Photo credit should read LOIC VENANCE/AFP/Getty Images) 74 Follow Share Tweet Google, the world’s largest Internet search engine, on Friday announced the rollout of out a new “Fact Check” feature that will put “fact check” tags on articles in its news search results. The new feature comes after Google had been criticized for not policing the content found in its search results, some accusing the firm of spreading fake news and misinformation. Google announced the new change in a blog post. “For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page. The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim.” The company is working with fact-checking organizations like Politifact and Snopes and plans to open the system up to other news organizations like The Washington Post and the New York Times, according to Bloomberg. Hypothetically, once the feature is opened up to multiple news organizations, there could be varying verdicts on whether a search result is true. Google reiterated in their statement that it wouldn’t apply to every search result and that the fact-checks were coming from outside sources. “This information won’t be available for every search result, and there may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions. These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgments.” Any publisher can apply to add fact-checks to news results, but Google will determine which appear in the results using their own search algorithms. The new feature comes on the heels of social media giant Facebook introducing tips for their users to help differentiate between real and fake news. Both organizations were widely criticized throughout the 2016 presidential election for helping facilitate the spread of misinformation. Google said they are not paying any of the fact-checking organizations for their contributions, nor will the fact-check label affect the order of search results.     Share Tweet Rate this story 16% 0% 2% 76% 7% Recommended from the Web Other Must-Read Stories 74 Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends, Earn Rewards!

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Rudresh Please share some for the N7 2013 too, pretty please! R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools.

Illustration: Brandon Celi by Lizette Chapman @lizette_chapman More stories by Lizette Chapman April 4, 2017, 6:00 AM EDT Peter Ma looked around his San Francisco condo and realized he’d won everything in it. His flat-screen TV, home theater system, 3D printers, phones, tablets, computers and furniture were either hackathon prizes or purchased with hackathon earnings. Stashed under his leather couch — which he’d bought with an Amazon gift card — was a thick stack of 2- and 3-foot-long cardboard checks commemorating his most cherished wins. “The only non-schwag I have are shoes,” he said. With his gray hoodie and close-cropped goatee, 33-year-old Ma looks like any of the thousands of computer programmers roaming the city, but he’s part of an elite corps. He and about a dozen friends travel the hackathon circuit. They build apps, connected devices and other products during all-night, fiercely competitive programming contests where sleep is scarce and caffeine is plentiful. The sessions are usually sponsored by corporations, and top prizes mean serious cash. (We explore hackathons for the younger set on this week’s Decrypted podcast; subscribe here on iTunes.) Some of the hackers have jobs. Some do contracting work. Some have corporate sponsors. Almost all of them are working on a pet startup idea. For Ma and a few others, hackathons are a job. Ma knows he would make more money if he had a more traditional career. He just doesn’t want one. “I have my time to myself and the freedom to work on whatever it is I want,” said Ma during a long lunch on a sunny Tuesday in March. Ma said he has considered offers from Google, Facebook and Uber over the years, but passed every time because he likes calling his own shots. Intel sponsors his work by sending him technology for company-related projects, and he also has an occasional gig consulting for large companies. He likes the setup because it allows him to travel and work on his own schedule. Brian Clark, 27, supported himself on hackathon earnings for more than two years. (He and Ma don’t know each other.) He’s working on his fourth startup idea now, and says he carves out time for competitions because they help him hone skills and earn money quickly. “I’d much rather earn that money in two days so I don’t have to take the programming job for two months,” Clark said. At one hackathon sponsored by Kmart and Sears, he built a mobile gifting app. None of his friends liked the idea, so he engineered it on his own and ended up winning $6,000 for fewer than four hours of work. Another time, when his bank account was down to zero and he was sleeping on a friend’s couch in Oakland, he entered a hackathon out of desperation. “It was win it or apply for a job,” said Clark. He and some friends spent a little more than a day building a tool enabling developers to troubleshoot mobile apps by tracking user behavior. “Out of 800 teams, I won first for $40,000.” Over the past three years, Ma has traveled to more than 100 hackathons, and his strategy is down to a science. He knows how to maximize his time and prizes. He enters competitions based on the quality of the sponsors (read: big money), the location (unless airfare is covered, he’s not inclined to leave the Bay Area) and which of his friends are planning to go. The cooler and newer the technology being promoted, the more interesting the hackathon is. Ma and Clark both look for events that will help them continue their education by practicing new skills. A few days before each hackathon, Ma checks that all his favorite programs and tools are up to date. Usually updates take 15 to 30 minutes, but sometimes there’s a glitch, a program fails and an update can take a couple of hours. The times he hasn’t done the prep work, like at a Smart Cities event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, have created chaos during the hackathon. “We didn’t know we needed an update and all the sample code stopped working,” said Ma. The oversight cost his team several hours to correct. “You know how a soldier goes to battle with a sword? Our weapons are our laptops.” Ma brings his computer, his iPhone, two Androids, a microprocessor development board and sensors for temperature, humidity and touch. He doesn’t pack a toothbrush. “I bring the basics,” he said. Clark packs his favorite blue fleece blanket and small pillow into his backpack along with his laptop and charging cables. (He also doesn’t bring a toothbrush.) Once he knows who the sponsors are and what technology they’re promoting, he writes a pitch describing the project he aims to build incorporating that tech and uses it as a script when he presents his project. “We had three guys building a fart app and 90 percent of the customers are women” Hackathons can vary in length, focus, judging criteria and other factors, but they all follow a similar pattern. Hackers register online, usually in teams of three to five people. Corporations hold competitions in all kinds of places: Any large space with bathrooms, screaming fast Wi-Fi and lots of power outlets will do. After each team claims their work area and stashes their gear, they meet with corporate sponsors to evaluate the tech tools they might use to build projects and, of course, get T-shirts and other schwag. Hackathons usually have a specific technology like augmented reality or a theme like “connected homes.” Hackers know about those categories in advance, but teams aren’t allowed to begin working until the official start. Most events last between 24 and 48 hours. During that time hackers work as a team to create something new, interesting and functional. Organizers provide all the food and drink — a menu that often includes pizza, burritos, energy drinks, chips and chocolate — so hackers can eat while they work. Many don’t sleep. Others take short naps under tables while their teammates continue coding on their laptops a few feet away. Calculating the salary of a professional hackathoner is not straightforward. Winners can earn tens of thousands of dollars every month, but much of that may come in the form of gift cards, service credits and gadgets. And since winnings are divided among team members, individual hauls vary depending on the size of the team. If these coders were working at Google as entry-level software engineers, they could each make about $127,000 a year, according to employer review site Glassdoor. That jumps to north of $200,000 for more senior positions. Jay Zalowitz, who lives in San Francisco and is 28, said he used hackathon earnings to bootstrap his startup for several years. He pared back his weekend hacking — it usually takes a couple of days to recover from such a lengthy grind — when he got a full-time programming job. “Once you start making real money, the amount you win is actually pretty marginal,” he said. Corporations have embraced hackathons in recent years. There were more than 1,000 in 2016, according to Devpost, a developer site that maintains a running list. Companies such as Microsoft and Amazon sponsor hackathons because the competitions allow them to show off their newest gadgets, like virtual-reality headsets and voice-control APIs. The more sponsors can entice developers to build with their products, the faster those products take off. IBM holds hundreds of hackathons — online and in person — every year. Some are massive. To push Watson, its artificial intelligence platform, IBM is now running a true marathon event (with a more normal work schedule) of three years with a $5 million prize attached. “We use it as a vehicle to push new technologies,” said IBM Chief Developer Advocate Willie Tejada. “We know it feeds revenue somewhere down the line.” Devpost founder Brandon Kessler said he’s recently noticed the rise of nontech companies and live events — like Fashion Week in New York — seeking to infuse technology into their main business by hosting and sponsoring hackathons. “They are becoming more of a daily tool for innovation,” he said. In March, Procter & Gamble hosted a hackathon in Redwood City, California, to promote Febreze plug-in scent dispensers and be inspired by new ideas for future products. Organizers invited Xerox’s PARC, Nest, Google, Amazon Alexa, cloud platform startup Arrayent and other companies promoting connected homes to attend so they could showcase their own technologies enabling connected Febreze dispensers. In exchange for $10,000 and prizes — including a PARC internship — dozens of developer teams slept in shifts during the 48-hour event to build the best project. Ma and his team, which brought a methane sensor to the event, built a fart app. When the sensor detected high levels of methane, it signaled the Febreze plug-in to emit a puff of fragrance. They didn’t win. “The technical integrations didn’t matter. It was all about the idea,” said Ma. He wished he’d had a woman on the team. “We had three guys building a fart app and 90 percent of the customers are women.” Procter & Gamble was happy with the results: One winning project connected the scent dispenser via Wi-Fi to a smartphone so users could control scent along with temperature and mood lighting. “Hackathons allow us to have access to some of the sharpest minds,” said Procter & Gamble spokeswoman Lauren Thaman, who said the company has done a couple such events and intends to do more. “It’s a very creative, fast way to get answers from innovators and early adopters.” Corporate hackathons don’t always go according to plan, though. Salesforce.com blazed into the hackathon scene in 2013, offering a $1 million grand prize — an unprecedented amount that dazzled hackers, who registered in record numbers to compete. But when judges awarded the prize to a former Salesforce employee, who had written some code before the hackathon officially began, the backlash from developers was severe. Salesforce clarified the rules in 2014 and has since abandoned the splashy competition in favor of an online learning program for developers. Ma says along with Salesforce’s withdrawal he’s noticed some companies have begun to offer smaller prizes. Founders sometimes game competitions, too, using hackathons as a place to launch their mostly baked startup ideas and presenting polished projects that have been a steady focus for months rather than a basic prototype created in a flash of inspiration. These forces have changed the competitive dynamic and made it harder to earn a living as a professional hackathoner. Of course, some hackers also drop out after they get jobs, get married or their immune systems can no longer withstand the stress of poor diet and no sleep. Ma says he plans to continue for as long as he can. He likes the freedom to build whatever he feels like and help larger social issues. He and friends recently competed in Code for the Kingdom, sponsored by Christian churches — a hackathon focused on solving homelessness, hunger and other social problems. They won $1,000. “I can always get a corporate job,” he said, slicing into seared branzino. “I don’t need to. That’s the backup plan.”   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P. All Rights Reserved Careers Made in NYC Advertise Ad Choices Website Feedback Help

First, he says, there was a long pause. They weren't a couple, and he didn't want to say the wrong thing. "I told her that it was her choice and if she chose to keep it, then I would be a good dad," he remembers. "I was freaking out."  At the time, Tony was in his mid-20s, working as a bartender and photographer in a college town out west. Tony started paying child support for his daughter near the end of the pregnancy, went to prenatal appointments, and took parenting classes along with the baby's mother. On the day his daughter was born, Tony cut the umbilical cord.  And Tony was an active father. As soon as his daughter could take a bottle, he says he started sharing custody of her, sometimes watching her three or four days a week. "We were really just good buddies," he says. "It felt good to have purpose, and it felt amazing to love something so much, in a completely new way."  Money became a source of tension, though, between Tony and the baby's mother. So did the fact that as his daughter got older, she started looking less like him or her mother. Tony decided to get a paternity test when his daughter was about a year old. "I couldn't play it dumb forever," Tony says—but he also feared the results. "That's not something that you want to know, especially when you love something so much." Tony quickly learned the truth: he had a zero percent probability of being the biological father. He called the mother to tell her, and soon after that, he met Victor*, the man who is his daughter's biological father. Over beers, they talked about Tony's shock, Victor's suspicions from the sidelines, and their plan for the little girl they both considered a daughter. More than two years later, they joined me to talk about the logistics and emotions of the transition that followed, which included packing up a pickup truck with nursery furniture to move it from Tony's place to Victor's.  *Last names have been withheld for privacy reasons.

Tony: Yeah. AS: Is it past tense? T: Yeah, probably. I wouldn't consider myself a father now. This is Death, Sex & Money. The show from WNYC about the things we think about a lot… …and need to talk about more. I'm Anna Sale. — Six years ago, when Tony was in his mid 20s, he was working as a bartender and a photographer in a western college town. One night after work, and a few drinks, he hooked up with a woman he dated back in high school. T: It was just pretty random. The whole thing just kind of happened really fast and then was over. Then, a few weeks later, she told him she was pregnant.  T: There was a really, really, really long silence after she told me, because I was pretty careful with what I wanted to say, for sure. And, um, I told her that it was her choice—everything. And if she chose to keep it then, I would be a good dad and I would take care of her and the baby. And I did give her a disclaimer that night and said that I didn't want to start a relationship with her because of a child. AS: Did you say, "Are you sure it's mine?" T: Um, yeah, we kind of talked that over and, um, it was just a brief, like, "You know that this is - this is mine?" And she said, "Yeah." Tony kept the pregnancy a secret from his family and friends for a few months. T: I was freaking out. But he started going to doctor's appointments with the baby's mother. They took parenting classes together, and he was in the room when the baby was born. T: I cut her umbilical cord. And the first time I really remember holding her was later that afternoon, um, after she was all cleaned up. And the nurse just plopped her right in my lap, and we just hung out. AS: What's the feeling you remember when you were looking down at her that first day? T: Um. Just that I needed to - I had a lot to figure out. But I was determined to do that for her—to figure out how to be a good dad, to make money, to provide for her. She was mine. I was really proud of the fact I created that. For the first few months, the baby spent most of her time at her mother's house. Tony would go over there a lot. But after the baby would take a bottle, Tony says he started taking care of her at his place a few days a week. T: I played guitar for her every time she took a bath so we'd play guitar and then we'd Facetime with my parents, and that was always fun. AS: A little girl in a bathtub being serenaded with a guitar is pretty nice. (Laughs) T: (Laughs) Yeah. She's a good little swimmer. She made a mess anyways, but it was fun. There was a lot of laughter between me and her. We played a lot. We were really just good buddies, you know? It felt good to have purpose, and it felt amazing to love something so much, in a completely new way. But as the baby grew into a toddler, Tony's relationship with her mother became more and more strained. Especially around money. T: I started paying, like, child support from a couple months before she was born, just to help out. So we did that and we started to have kind of a just mutual agreement, um, but that's tough to hold on to without getting a professional to say, okay, we just need to lay down some ground rules. And at that time I think I was working three jobs, and it made things really tense at times. And then money just became - it was just not good. AS: Was there ever - did a judge grant a certain amount of child support and codify what your custody sharing was gonna be? T: No. That was the process that we were going through was all that legal stuff. Kind of at the peak of me going, "I need to get this test taken." Because at that point, I was having doubt. AS: When did you have that first flash of, "I'm not sure if this child is mine?" T: I maybe had doubts at about a year. Like, her eyes were starting to be darker and darker. I have blue-green eyes and her mother has hazel eyes, And she has this crazy curly hair. When she was little—she still has it—but, like wild. People in the community would be like, "Where did she get that hair?" "Where does she -" you know? I'd be like, "I don't know." (Laughs) I really don't. I couldn't play it dumb forever. I'd talked to two of my best friends at the time, and said I was thinking about doing it about a week before. And you could almost like feel a sense of relief on their faces, too. Like it was something that they had thought about but maybe didn't ever want to talk to me about. AS: Was there part of you that thought, "I don't want to know." T: Yeah, totally. That's why I think it took so long for me to do it. That's not something that you want to know, especially when you love something so much. AS: How old the baby when you had the test? T: She was almost 16 months, I think? AS: What did the test involve? How did you do it? T: You just show up, and they do a cheek swab. It's really simple. You just sign a couple documents - AS: Did you take her? T: Yeah. I took her in. And since I was the legal guardian, I didn't have to have mother's consent, and so I just went. AS: How did you get the results? T: Through a phone call. I was at work. And then the woman gave me the statistical analysis of the DNA and ended with, "You have a zero percent probability of being the father." I didn't really know what to say. Just kind of in shock. But almost expecting it. AS: Why did it matter? T: What do you mean? Why did it matter if she was mine or not? I think it's just biology. I think there's something that you need to know that that's your baby, you know? And I just didn't want to be living like a lie, or be lied to. AS: When you saw the baby next after getting the results, did it feel different? T: Yeah. Man, it was - man, it was really sad for me. I felt really guilty. Whew, sorry. AS: It's okay, take your time. T: I just felt really guilty to feel that way. AS: Guilty to feel which way? T: Just to feel different. It was nothing to do with me and my daughter's relationship. I knew all of that stuff was so genuine, and that was why it was so hard and why I felt so guilty about feeling that way, was because what we had was so real. I mean, I was her father. Even with the results in my hand I was her father. Because I raised her and she was my little girl and I loved her. But the reality was it wasn't going to pan out that way. We talked with the mother of the baby. She confirmed the details of this story, and said she didn't want to comment further. Coming up… Victor: I think he texted me about talking about getting together and it might have -  T: I thought he reached out to me, but maybe we did-  V: Who knows. I don't remember. Tony meets his daughter's other father. V: The way I've lived my life, it was kind of one of those things where, who didn't expect my first child to come this way? You know, in some sort of a Maury Povich-style moment, you know? — Since our episode about breakups came out last month, you've continued to add your tips to the Breakup Survival Kit we've been building together. It's a Google doc of what's helped you through. The link is at deathsexmoney.org. It's made those of you NOT going through a breakup jealous, and want your own survival kit. A listener named Brooke emailed this week, "I loved your Breakup Survival Kit, and I was wondering if you have considered doing a marriage survival kit, or parent survival kit." This made me smile, thinking about how all of us—no matter what life phase—could use a handy Google Doc. I tweeted about it and got a response from @missElaMap—a painter based in, as her Twitter bio says, the "deep hot humid South." She wrote, "How about an 'I'm almost 50 and single and living in a new town and know no one' survival kit?" So, we can't make a survival kit for all of your life phases right now, but let's start here, with tips for Ela. Have you ever moved somewhere alone? How'd you start to feel grounded? And if you've moved a lot in your life, how has it felt different for you at different ages? I've been thinking about this as I get settled after this big move out here to California. I have my husband, my baby and my dog to keep me company. But that also keeps me from leaving the house! Send your tips for getting settled in a new town to us at deathsexmoney@wnyc.org—and we'll build a very personalized survival kit for Miss Ela out there. And I may steal some of the tips for myself. On the next episode, a prison guard at San Quentin, who came to a turning point in her career five years ago when she realized she wanted to come out as trans. Mandi Hauwert: I felt like I had a couple options. Leave San Quentin and transition somewhere else. Or stay at San Quentin and never transition. There was never transition at San Quentin because who would do that? That's insane. — This Death, Sex & Money from WNYC. I'm Anna Sale. After Tony got the results of his paternity test, things moved fast. He called the mother… T: And I asked her if she knew who the father was. And she said, "I think so." AS: Did she sound surprised? T: She sounded caught. AS: Did you feel angry with her? T: Yeah. Yeah. I felt pretty upset. I just didn't know what to think at all. I didn't know whether to be mad or sad or relief in some weird way. So I wasn't like, you know, wasn't screaming at her over the phone or anything. I just said, "You need to figure out who the father is and tell him." V: The second I heard her on the phone I had kind of known whatever was going on had, had changed completely. This is Victor. He has dark eyes, and a history with the same woman as Tony. Victor heard from her right after Tony got the test results. V: She asked me to go over there, and I said okay. So just I went up there, and I walked in the door. There was my daughter, and not another word about it. I actually just kind of sat there with her for a while. AS: Did she respond to you like you were a stranger? V: Oddly, no. I mean, it was, it was kind of a - you know we just - with my daughter, one thing anybody can attest to is that she'll make sure you guys are friends no matter what. You know, whether you want to or not. So… T: She's super social. V: Yeah, so, I mean, to say that she was totally responsive in a way that, you know, she realized there was some sort of connection? I don't know. Because I've seen her do that with people at the grocery store. (Laughs) Before all of this happened, Tony and Victor didn't know each other, even though they live in the same town and were both single guys hanging around the bar scene. When Victor heard about the pregnancy, he wondered if he could be the father. But he heard that Tony was the dad, so he let it go. Then, the baby was born and Victor saw pictures of her on Facebook, through her mother's account. V: As soon as I saw the pictures it was kind of like an overwhelming reality for me. AS: Did you think the little girl looked like you? V: Yeah. Yeah.  Victor started mentioning his suspicions to other people they knew. But getting proof? That was complicated. V: I had discussed it with her friends before I said "I need your help" to do this. Like give me a piece of hair from a brush and I'll go do the rest, you know. I'll take care of everything. Called the state and they're like, "We can't just go DNA test kids that you think look like you." And I'm like… AS: You called. V: Yeah, I called a bunch. AS: Do you, like shame about that that you didn't that you didn't find a way to step in sooner or you just didn't know how? V: Always, yeah, there will always be that, you know small sense of shame. It was kind of like, "Hey. Now, something needs to be done and now how do I do it?" How do I do it without you know, just, leaving behind a trail of destruction for two families, possibly three?" You know, in terms of what if I'm wrong. There was always that outside chance, even though I saw her face, I saw everything going on, I had known the timelines, everything like that—what if I was wrong? The one time I did meet my daughter my family went to breakfast on Father's Day. And somebody yelled my name from behind me, and I turned around and it was, um, my baby's mother and my child sitting at a table with her family for Father's Day. So I went over and said hello. And I think I just stared, just like hawk-eyeing the kid. T: The irony. V: I, I don't even remember what the mother said. And I was like, I'm sitting here, on Father's Day, looking at my kid and my whole family is sitting behind me. And I went over to my brother and I sat down. He's like, "Is that, the moth--is that, you know, Mom?" I said yeah, and he's like, "Well, what do we do?" And I was like, you shut up because if my mom finds out, then this place is going to get torn apart. (Laughs) She even, like, smells that kid, we're going to have a problem. So yeah, I just sat down and I was quiet. And I think that was probably one of the longest breakfasts I ever had in my life. AS: Did you know that? T: I didn't know that. V: Oh you didn't? Yeah. It was a - T: No. I spent Father's Day, weirdly enough, while you were doing that I was probably researching the DNA test. Because I remember I didn't have her for the morning, and that was like on my, on my brain around that time. V: A lot of wheels turning on Father's Day that year, I guess. T: Yeah it was a big day. (Laughs) Hearing Tony and Victor laugh together like this, it was not what I expected when I first heard about this story in an email from Tony. Disputes about paternity, I thought, pit men against each other. Like, there is not a more potent threat to masculinity than thinking you fathered a child and being wrong. But that's not how it was with Tony and Victor, from the first time they met over beers. It was just a few days after Tony found out the truth. T: I was, really nervous and, um, I just, you know, was praying that he was a good guy. V: We were both upset, we were both hurt, and you know, mad, so. I think we actually took that--those two emotions like, all those emotions that we both had, um, and somehow rolled it into a bit of a positive thing. You know, when you're sitting there feeling that way by yourself, you can just—it can snowball. But, you know, seeing somebody else feel that way, it's kind of like, "Mmmkay, you know, I'm not the only person that's going through this, so, maybe I can empathize instead of just sit here and focus on how mad I am." So. AS: So you looked at Tony as a guy who understood in a way that many other people couldn't? V: Exactly. I mean, hell, I think the first time we met, we joked about like, "Man, just wish we could do this together," you know? Like, this is working out well. T: Let's just raise a child together. V: This is going great, let's just do this thing. (Laughs) AS: When you first started talking about what the next steps were, how did you talk together about which roles of a father which of you were going to do? V: Um, what I wanted Tony to know initially was that you know, I'd I'd love him to stay involved in any capacity that he felt comfortable. Never wanted him to feel like, you know he was being shooed away from, from my side of the family. And the way I initially thought about it is just what's wrong with having more people around to love her? You know? Why would there be an issue with that? That's what Tony thought too. At first. T: I thought that I would still be a part of her life, but that I would play definitely a lesser role. AS: And what did you picture when you pictured that? T: I pictured taking her to go get a cheeseburger and some ice cream, or go to a basketball game or something. You know, long term, that could be my role as just like an uncle. AS: When did you notice that she was becoming aware that there was something changing? T: Well when we introduced Victor in, it was obviously a new adult in her life, and then he was assuming roles and doing things that we would be doing, you know, picking her up from daycare, you know. Cooking dinner, hanging out. And when she would call me "dad," you know? It was like, oh, there's a new thing I need to like, figure out. Do I tell her not to call me dad? Or do we just let that happen naturally? And then I obviously saw her a little bit less and less, and she was a little confused. You know? AS: How could you tell? T: She was just a little more, distracted. I don't know how to explain it. I mean, you're a parent. She could read me like a book and I could read her the same way. And, you know, she would look to me like, "What's the deal, man?" You know, "Why haven't I seen you in a week?" And you could feel that, you know? And I knew that it was only going to get longer and longer. So that was really hard for me—that transition was. And it just got to a point where I just couldn't do it at all. AS: It was too hard. T: Yeah it was just like reliving that same thing over and over again. And I just felt like I was breaking our trust every time. You know? Like I was letting her down. AS: So it was your choice to change that? T: Yeah. And Victor was transitioning more and more into it. And so, you know, he was doing a good job filling that role. It just felt like time to just maybe try to move on. Or just let it be them. Let them figure it out for awhile without me in the picture. AS: Victor, did you—when Tony told you that it was too hard for him to have regular visits with your daughter, that he thought it would be ah, best to step out of her life—did you worry about what that would mean for your daughter to lose him? V: I don't think - like I said, the more people that we had to love her, the better. And I was excited about that. But at no point did I feel like anybody walked away from anything that was, you know, not understandable. And also I think that, you know, we all knew that we were all going to be there when we needed to. So filling in for that spot, I didn't feel like there was a hole left. It just kind of put the pressure on me: this is going to change for her and it can't affect her. You know, so I've gotta do this—I've gotta step in and be who I need to be. And I was ready to be there, you know, I had kind of been sitting watching for a long time, and seeing everything transpire, and so I was ready to get in. Victor started paying child support. Tony stopped. Between them, they decided to treat it like they were square, so Victor didn't reimburse Tony or anything like that. But he did take a truckload of baby stuff off Tony's hands, when Tony was beginning to try to move on. T: I had a baby dresser, crib, chair, tons of toys. You know, it's what a baby's room looks like. And so rather than him spend all of this money and buy new things, it made sense just to have the things that she already loved and cared about. And so one day, he just came over to my house, backed his truck into my driveway and I just unloaded everything into his truck, and that was...I mean, physically and literally, all in one afternoon, it became pretty real. You know? To just put everything in boxes and then to give it to this guy. AS: You loaded up the truck together? T: Mhmm. AS: Did you cry? T: Um, like around him? (Laughs) No. No. I think we just shook hands. AS: How long has it been since you saw your little girl? T: Probably two years. AS: Why so long? T: I just don't know how to approach it now. You know what I mean? Because I am trying to put closure on all of this. And I'll love her forever for what we had but, we don't have that anymore. AS: Are there things that you want Victor to know about this little girl when she was a little baby? T: I've never really thought about that. If he ever needed to know anything about it or was curious then I would tell him. But yeah, I don't know, I think that part is my time with her. And, um, she was an amazing little baby, you know. And she's still an amazing girl. And I think he already knows that. So I mean, as far as specific goes, there's - if he was ever curious I would tell him in a heartbeat, but nothing off the top of my head that I'm, you know, gonna - V: Yeah, those memories still belong to him. I mean, he's the one that was putting in the work and the time in those situations. It's not - without him volunteering the information, you know, it's just like asking somebody what their favorite parts of their ex-girlfriend was. And, you know, it's just, it's information that's there that, um, if it's that good and it's that worth talking about then he'll talk to me about it. I mean, he could have told me that she farts like a truck driver, but - (Laughs) T: That's a no-brainer. V: Yeah. That would have been a nice heads-up. But other than that then all that's his.  T: Yeah, sorry about that. — That's Tony and Victor. Victor now has joint custody of his daughter. She's five years old. And at the end of this month, Tony is leaving town after living there for more than a decade. He's still looking for a fresh start.

It’s been four months since the OP3 and OP3T received the update and there’s been nothing but radio silence on the OP2 and OPX’s potential updates since June 2016, when OnePlus stated that the OP2 would eventually receive Nougat. No similar statement seems to have been made about the OPX, however. This isn’t for a lack of trying from users, who have created multiple posts on OnePlus’ online forums and one user went so far as to create a Thunderclap campaign — for those unaware, Thunderclap is a ‘crowdspeaking’ platform that aims to aggregate individual voices into one concerted campaign. The message that’s being backed is: “Get to know how #OnePlus treats its old customers and breaks its promises,” followed by a link to the campaign. OnePlus, however, has declined to comment in several social media posts, and also declined to comment to Android Police.  Source: OnePlus Forums Via: Android Police Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Reddit Featured Articles CRTC reveals phase one of plan to transfer telephone subsidy to broadband funding Kik CEO says he wants to create a completely new payments experience in chat Electronic Arts pledges to invest $500 million in Montreal’s game industry over 10 years Poop Troop Emoji Keyboard provides you with a poop animation for every situation Graceful Explosion Machine is the first Canadian-developed Nintendo Switch game Sign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Thank you for your subscription Related Articles News May 25, 2016 11:31 AM EDT OnePlus slashes price of OnePlus 2 to $399 and OnePlus X to $269 News Aug 22, 2016 8:59 PM EDT Android Marshmallow now available on the OnePlus X News Nov 24, 2016 1:16 PM EDT OnePlus won’t say whether it plans to provide further software support for the OnePlus 2 and X News Apr 9, 2016 3:05 PM EDT OnePlus 2 owners can now install Android Marshmallow on their device Comments AMB_07 I really feel sorry for OnePlus X users. In terms of support that phone has been a disaster. hunkyleepickle really? the 3t was essentially the only phone with 7.1 other than the pixel for a while. AMB_07 What does that have to do with OnePlus X? hunkyleepickle Plenty actually. AMB_07 Well not really. OnePlus X support has been abysmal since the start. Doesn’t matter how good the support the support for OnePlus 3T is, it’s not going to change anything for OnePlus X users. hunkyleepickle Still relevant I think. Gotta upgrade at some point brow. AMB_07 Again, support has been bad – since the beginning. How do you upgrade from a phone that is just released? eszklar Well, there is LineageOS for both phones. Omar LineageOS is the best way to go. Running 7.1.1. on my OPO, and even though it’s not officially stable it is still very stable enough to use as my regular device. Fshumayrqan So does Samsung? Sevensage Not getting nougat isn’t such a big deal, not providing security patches is negligent. XDA is full of young devs patching roms with Android security patches but OnePlus could not manage to, at the very minimum do that. Foul! Omar The X has the same SD801 as the One. Bad news for X owners ever expecting Nougat… What we were told about the One (by Cyanogen) was that Snapdragon didn’t update the drivers for the SD801, so there would be no official update. So don’t get your hopes up with the X.

Steward Bank CEO Dr. Lance Mambondiani delivered a keynote address encapsulating key statistics and highlighting areas that senior management should address in order to respond to the demands of the digital age. “As long as we are not evolving our businesses to the tune of global trends, we are businesses of the past, not of the future. We have to evolve or die,” he emphasised. With two companies in a race to become the first trillion dollar business: Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and Apple, the digital age is not slowing down. advertisement Every business should be concerned with ‘speed to market’ and ‘costs of distribution’, service, and getting the product to the market. Digital platforms are valuable in the way they allow on-boarding of customers at a cheaper cost. Dr Mambondiani quoted Bill Gates as saying “banking is necessary. Banks are not,” asserting that legacy banks are forced to evolve due to market pressure and innovations. Fintech is competing with traditional banks, service by service. Banking is a land of digital opportunities, and while every business will be tested as it evolves in the digital space, it is more important to adapt according to customer needs. “We are not living in the digital ‘era’ because digital is now. Digital is the present and it’s here to stay,” he concluded. Digital Future 2017 will present key speakers from prominent organisations on the continent, further elaborating on ideas introduced at the CEO Megabyting Session. Tumi Chaka, an Analytical Lead at Google, will present experience working in data analytics to highlight best practice analysis techniques for brand marketers. His expertise enables businesses to leverage their data and derive strategic insights for marketing strategies. Sonia Sengupta, Marketing Executive for MNet’s Eastern and Southern African channels, will bring insights from her experiences as a Market Researcher for GfK, specialising in telecoms, consumer electronics and gaming sectors for the Angolan, Mozambican and South African markets. Kalay Maistry, Business Unit Head at Magna Carta Reputation Management Consultants (South Africa), will present specialised knowledge drawn from over 20 years’ experience as a journalist and broadcast technical advisor. With experience as a Southern African correspondent at organisations such as Al Jazeera English, SABC, Talk Radio 702, ETV among others, Maistry will provide invaluable knowledge for media practitioners. A host of local content producers and distributors will also be in attendance sharing their insights to local market dynamics and how best practitioners can get their hands wrapped around doing business online in Zimbabwe. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Agrippa Mugwagwa, Digital Future 2017, Lance Mambondiani, TBWA ZImbabwe, Vincent Kahiya Follow us on Facebook Techzim Previous Post « U-Report Zimbabwe: Leveraging SMS for research Next post #EcoCash zero rates merchant payments on Thursdays, Government imposes 5% health tax on Telecoms Operators Ep22 » Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

If businesses are to make this new, varied environment work, they must equip themselves to view their information from a single, comprehensive viewpoint - or risk being undermined by divided, insecure data Nick Ismail Whilst many organisations have publicly stated their aim to be 100% cloud in the near future it is likely that for many, a hybrid state will exist with some combination of software as a service vendors (SaaS) such as Salesforce, adoption of Platform as a service vendors (PaaS) such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and some traditional on premise applications. There are compelling cost, skill and agility reasons to adopt cloud in whatever format, but this re-platforming exercise will re-ignite some traditional issues that many organisations have invested heavily in trying to solve. In a world of increasing real time analytics, mobile applications and more stringent data governance, many organisations are struggling to manage a complex data landscape of many applications located in many different data centres with different skills sets. >See also: The shifting role of the IT professional In 2017 The problem was then how to integrate, secure and deliver data for analytical purposes to create value in a manner that would pass a regulators scrutiny. In such organisations invariably a data management strategy was developed to tackle this siloed data phenomenon. In the new hybrid world, data fragmentation will be taken to a whole new level with data in multiple, private clouds, public clouds and SAAS applications. Not only is the data more fragmented than ever before, but now data will likely reside outside the firewall introducing new security fears over how sensitive data is managed and regulated. As companies look to balance their data and processes between these three broad locations – private cloud, public cloud and on-premise – it’s essential that they have tools in place to enable a consolidated view over their data. With a data management strategy and toolset they can support business agility whilst ensuring they don’t lose track of critical data assets. Otherwise this could result in worryingly low productivity, or worse, a major security breach or large regulatory fine. What’s the situation? In the two decades since the internet boom, the enterprise world has gone through several infrastructure phases. First came on-premise, when companies built massive in-house data repositories and proprietary systems. As the skill base eroded and costs spiralled to keep the lights on, cloud became a logical alternative. Initially it was thought that eventually everything was going to move online into the cloud. Now there is another, more moderate change in how businesses talk about cloud – companies are putting different data in different places – cloud or on-premise – depending on their requirements. >See also: Getting real visibility for monitoring virtual environments For example, a bank might keep its customer account data on-premise, to ensure it has total control over its security. That helps it to meet regulatory demands and reassure its customers. On the other hand, a ticketing company might move its bookings system into a private cloud, to give it scalability as well as security so that it can handle huge numbers of requests without worrying about scams or data loss, and make it cheaper to stand up and shut down new services. A global professional services company however, might decide to move its day-to-day running data (for sales and marketing, say) into a public cloud, enabling its employees to access key information wherever they are – helping them to remain agile, with workers collaborating across the globe. What’s the problem? The adoption of cloud is rapid and increasing exponentially quarter on quarter. One company can now access essential information that is spread across a whole range of locations. That might sound very efficient and sensible, but it comes at a price. Keeping company data in these siloes makes it much harder to get a single view over information – people continue to make the same mistakes, whatever the technology. Cloud is easy to adopt as it often requires no hardware and installation so increasing with the promise of agility this has meant many tech savvy line of business managers have rushed to implement new applications and environments in the cloud. This will often benefit their own business unit but it frequently causes a headache to the wider business as it becomes another silo of data which is not easily integrated or governed. >See also: The golden rules of hybrid cloud It’s important not to quash this entrepreneurial spirit and cloud can provide lower costs if managed correctly and supporting both these elements will offer a competitive advantage. However, this cannot be done in a silo. It’s essential that companies have a comprehensive view of their operational data if they are to drive business efficiencies and new strategic initiatives. If sales can’t use marketing data, for example, or if finance can’t access customer databases, then each department is going to miss out on insights that could benefit the company as a whole. After all, the more you know, the more accurate and effective your strategy will be. But hybrid cloud siloes are not just a problem for operational efficiency. Security too can be compromised by a segmented approach to data management. Using multiple clouds and on-premise solutions increases the chance of a breach, as more potential entry points arise. If not properly tracked, this will expose the business it to unnecessary risk. This problem is compounded by the fact that many organisations are now coming to the realisation that major cloud providers are more able to successfully protect their data than they are themselves. This makes companies more likely to ‘file and forget’, trusting their providers without considering the damage that could result from operating across multiple providers and clouds. What’s the solution? Clearly, organisations need to approach hybrid cloud with caution to avoid these pitfalls. The good news is that although there may be functional cloud siloes in the hybrid world (gaps between HR, marketing, sales and so on), in the technical sense, there are no silos – it’s just a case of getting information out of multiple clouds and into a central view for business analytics purposes. With that in mind, companies must ensure they have a strong data management strategy and toolset in place to integrate, aggregate, sort, clean and monitor data from across their hybrid cloud infrastructure and deliver it for analysis or use by a person or application. >See also: Digital business trends 2017 Wherever data originates, whether on-premise, in a public SaaS app or a private cloud server, businesses must be able to bring it under a unified management process if they are to get the most of out of their information assets and remain compliant. A holistic view of data will enable them to drive decisions based on the expertise of the company business-wide. Finally, it’s essential to track data wherever it moves to ensure it is secure both at its source and at its destination. Companies using a hybrid cloud environment must be able to identify sensitive information wherever it resides and ensure that it is does not move anywhere without appropriate security. For example, ensuring that customers’ personal information is never allowed to move onto the public internet through a system backdoor. Granular data management is a must for a secure and efficient hybrid cloud. If businesses are to make this new, varied environment work, they must equip themselves to view their information from a single, comprehensive viewpoint – or risk being undermined by divided, insecure data.   Sourced by Greg Hanson, VP EMEA cloud, Informatica   Nominations are now open for the Tech Leaders Awards 2017, the UK’s flagship celebration of the business, IT and digital leaders driving disruptive innovation and demonstrating value from the application of technology in businesses and organisations.

The combined number of Android devices running 7.0 and 7.1 increased by 2.1 percentage points compared to the same time last month. While that doesn’t sound particularly impressive, at its current pace Nougat will be on approximately one-third of Android devices in one year. Moreover, compared to Marshmallow at the same point in its history, Nougat is currently outpacing 6.0. Older versions of Google’s operating system didn’t fare so well in the one month period since the company last updated its data. With the exception of Nougat, all other versions of Android either saw their share of the operating system stagnant or drop. For the first time in Android’s history, the number of devices running Marshmallow decreased. It was only a small 0.1 percent drop. Nonetheless, that change still marks a turning point for Google’s operating system. Moving forward, it’s all about Nougat and Android O.

I don’t blame Google. I blame the manufacturers for being slow to release updates (if they release them at all) and the carriers for delaying updates so that they can add their bloatware. Google need to rethink Android licensing rules to encourage updating and to prevent the carriers from dragging their heels. therealsybarite Why doesn’t google release the android distribution data for nexus phones? because they’re not that much better. ciderrules No, it’s Googles fault. They need to step up and get tough on manufacturers who are slow to update. They like to pick & choose when they enforce the rules as it suits them. There’s no incentive for them to force manufacturers to update. There’s a huge incentive getting as many Android devices out there as possible. After all, gotta mine that data to support your advertising business. Smanny First of all Android is completely different to iOS. I don’t know why people try to compare it to iOS so much. Android is an open source OS, so any manufacturer can take it, use it, modify it, add to it in any way they see fit. This is one of the reasons why Android runs on more hardware these days than Windows, iOS, and a number of other OS’s combined. If they were to close Android, or really lock it down, then Android would loose a lot of OEMs, and what would be even worse is a number of OEMs would just fork Android themselves. In other words the cat is out of the bag, and it’s impossible to put it back in. Another benefit is OEMs don’t have to wait to test out a new SoC, or GPU, or for that matter they can try out any hardware or software changes they want, and they don’t have to wait for Google to make updates in order to accommodate the new hardware or SoCs. This is one of the reasons why Microsoft’s​ Windows Phone and now Windows 10 mobile hasn’t grown or taken off with OEMs. They have to wait for Microsoft to add or support new hardware, like SoCs, GPUs, and more. That is why Windows mobile OEMs have to choose from a list of supported​ hardware. If it’s not on the list, then they have to wait for Microsoft to add support for the hardware that they would like to use, or don’t use that hardware. I always thought it was funny how Microsoft would position themselves to make it look like they were competing with Android in the hardware arena. Ciderrules just last year alone (2016), there was over 4000 different Android device types that were manufactured. So you can see that it’s impossible to control. There was even a $4 Android smartphone. How do you compete with that? Not to mention there are tons of Android smartphones under the $200 mark. When devices are at those prices, it’s completely understandable​ why a number of OEMs will not bother with updating the software on devices in that price category. However many will use that to say, that it’s Google’s fault for not updating or forcing OEMs to update the Android smartphones. This isn’t true for a number of OEMs. For example Motorola’s​ Moto Gx and Moto Ex devices do get updates. Yet those devices are around the $200 mark and below. So it’s once again up to the users to pick devices that do support updates, if that is important to them. Android is all about choice, and it definitely fulfills that area in spades. No other OS can offer such a diverse ecosystem of not only software, but hardware as well. I guess that is why Android has close to 3 million apps now and it’s still growing. Not to mention more people use Android for browsing the web now, than any other OS on the planet. It even beat out Windows. I know ciderrules you hate Android, and it shows on a number of your posts. But there is no denying that Android is going to continue to grow. Fshumayrqan Samsung the last one to updates. DownwithRobellus With all these companies getting hacked you would think manufacturers would want to make sure their customers get the latest updates for their devices. It’s just another reason why I jumped over to iOS after all these years with Android… I can sleep at night knowing my data is secure and the chances of me getting malware or hacked is very slim.

HU About Contact The Budapest Beacon News In Brief Public Policy Economics Politics Civil Society Media Issues Op-Ed “Love Letters” April 9, 2017 You are here: Home / Economics / Russian code used to track access on gov’t national consultation website Russian code used to track access on gov’t national consultation website April 8, 2017 by Benjamin Novak 444.hu noticed a few interesting lines of code on the government’s national consultation website. The website, which was set up by Antal Rogán’s propaganda ministry, asks users to provide their name, e-mail address and age before allowing them to fill out the online version of the government’s latest national consultation. The code belongs to Yandex, Russia’s IT equivalent of Google. In addition to offering services such as e-mail, a search engine and cloud services, the Russian company provides analytics services to website owners. This means Yandex gathers valuable information about users who access a website where the Yandex analytics code is present. The presence of the Yandex code provides a way to track and monitor the usage of the national consultation’s official website and, according to 444.hu, provides services that go well beyond that of Google’s own analytics code. According to 444.hu, it seems unusual that an EU country or NATO ally would use such technology on government-run websites. In 2011, the BBC reported that Yandex handed over private information on certain users to Russia’s state security service, FSB. The information given to the FSB was on customers that had used Yandex’s payment system (which is similar to PayPal) to donate money to an anti-corruption website launched by the Russian blogger Alexey Navalny.

Now, it has its sights set on poaching top talent from life sciences and health care. Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have stressed in the past that Google will not become a health care company, in part because of the regulatory complexity associated with the field. But today, three of Alphabet's "Other Bets" are focused on the $3 trillion sector. Both of its venture arms, GV (formerly Google Ventures) and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) are also investing in the space. Sidewalk Labs is perhaps the most surprising. The Alphabet subsidiary, which aims to use technology to solve "big urban problems," this month posted new job listings for health care positions, including engineers, a chief health officer (a primary care physician) and a head of community health for an effort called "Care Labs." Not much has been shared publicly about Care Labs, aside from a Medium post that spells out a big vision to imagine "how care delivery might look in the digital era." Alphabet's Calico, a drug development shop focused on longevity, and Verily, which was Google's life sciences arm, and have also hired heavily from life sciences and health care. The company's star talent in the field so far includes Arthur D. Levinson, former CEO of Genentech and an Apple chairman, who is Calico's CEO; Tom Insel, the former head of the National Institute of Mental Health, who is at Verily; and Jessica Mega, a star cardiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, now at Verily. Alphabet is currently looking to hire computational biologists, robotics experts and top academic researchers, which are among the most competitive positions to hire. Competitors in the life sciences industry have mixed feelings about Alphabet's recruiting. "Of all the tech companies, Alphabet has been most prominent in establishing new operations in life sciences," says Cynthia Yee, a principal at health-focused fund Windham Venture Partners. "In the short-term, we'll see some biotech and health startups struggle to match the salary and compensation that an established company like Alphabet can offer," Yee said. She said several of the startups in her firm's portfolio have already lost key talent to Alphabet, but she declined to provide specifics. It might benefit the industry in the long-run, she says, if Alphabet steps up to acquire life sciences startups or seeks out partnerships. Verily has already announced a string of partnerships with industry giants, including GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, and Sanofi. Steve Kraus, a biotech investor at Bessemer Venture Partners says the life sciences industry will get more nervous if Alphabet starts recruiting heavily in their backyard. Alphabet's companies are headquartered in Silicon Valley, rather than in Boston and Cambridge where life sciences companies have deep connections to the science and engineering departments at Harvard and MIT. "I worry about the war for talent," he says. "Alphabet will make a real go of it, but if there's power in a cluster." Others, like biotech executive and geneticist Sabah Oney from start-up Alector believe that Alphabet's interest in the space is a "net positive" overall. "I've seen so many smart scientists get offers to consult or join Google for real money," he says. "Scientists are so underpaid and undervalued, so the competition can only be a good thing."

Android Nougat now runs on less than 5 percent of Android-powered by smartphones if we go by the latest Google OS distribution chart numbers. Interestingly, the data also revealed that Android Lollipop still holds a majority of market share followed by Marshmallow, exposing the saga of slow adoption rates of Android OS. The data collected during a 7-day period ending on April 3, 2017, shows a 4.5 percent for Nougat 7.0 and 0.4 per cent share for Nougat 7.1, making a grand total of 4.9 percent of devices running on the latest Android version, up from 2.8 percent in March.    Google is all set to announce its next generation of the Android operating system, Android O, pretty soon. However, looking at the current adoption rate, it is sad to see that the Android Nougat, which was released in October last year, has failed to capture a sizeable market share. This shows the sad saga of Android fragmentation and other manufacturers’ inefficiency to push for the newer updates.      Moving on, the stats also revealed that Android Lollipop is still a dominant player with version 5.1 taking a lion share of 23.0 per cent, while version 5.0 has a share of 9.0 per cent, making a grand total of 32 percent, a decrease of just 0.5 percent.   Coming to Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the adoption rate negligibly declined from31.3 per cent to 31.2 per cent. Other than this, Kitkat is now installed on 20 per cent of devices, while Jelly Bean now holds a market share of 10.1 per cent. Ice Cream Sandwich holds a 0.9 per cent share and the oldest running Gingerbread also account 0.9 percent share as well and if this trend continues then soon we may see the update not included in the Android Distribution chart anymore.
