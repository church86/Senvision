Sure, you might stumble upon a ZIP file chock full of quality scribblings every once in a while or a well-curated storefront here and there, but acquiring wallpapers is a generally arduous undertaking. It’s a process, in fact, that can take almost as much time as choosing one. Well, Google’s here to help. On Thursday, the Mountain View, California-based giant released a new app for Android, Wallpapers, that packs an extraordinary number of illustrations, images, and photography with which to spruce up your mobile. In terms of functionality, Wallpapers is relatively bare bones. It’s in essence a curated portal: open the app and you’re presented with dazzling collections of satellite imagery from Google Earth, a Google collection drawn from its topographical mapping service; landscape photography from partners like 500px; architectural highlights by city, region, country, and continent; a variety of textures and materials; and artwork of a generally abstract nature. Every wallpaper in the collection includes an “explore” tab that provides details on the artist, and, if applicable, the location. Related: Google Pixel XL review If you’re the indecisive sort, there’s an option to set a live wallpaper that’ll rotate the artwork on your device’s home screen every day. And if you’re lucky enough to have a device running Android 7.0 Nougat or later, you can set different images for both your home screen and lock screen. If all that sounds a little familiar, that’s probably because Google’s Pixel phones ship with a similar set of wallpaper customization tools. In fact, the new Wallpapers seems almost identical in appearance to the Pixels’ artwork picker, down to the Wallpaper app’s “live wallpapers,” or animated artwork of the Earth from outer space, solar phenomenon, and scenic vistas. That last bit’s a tad unexpected: Google has previously implied that live wallpapers would remain exclusive to its newly-launched Pixel smartphones. “Wallpapers serve as the very first touchpoint for users and help establish a premium experience and build an emotional connection,” Google wrote in a blog post announcing live wallpapers. “For the Pixel, we wanted to design an experience that was both inherent and unique to Google.” But the surprise is a welcome one — in this writer’s opinion, the search giant’s live wallpapers are by far the collection’s most entrancing. Related: We snuck a peek inside Google’s first pop-up shop, and AI was everywhere The new Wallpapers app is available for download from the Google Play Store. It’s compatible with Android devices running Android 4.1 and above. Also watch: We put the new Google Pixel XL smartphone through its paces – so how did it do?

The company has been working hard constantly for quite some time and has brought in numerous changes and updated features in the tech market. Major innovations in the tech field have been introduced by Google which has improved the lives of many people around the globe. The company also keeps offering many new apps and updates them regularly with the new improvements. The latest app update that Google has to offer for Google Keep. ‘Keep’ Taking Notes Google Keep is one of the widely used Android apps. Slowly and steadily, it is becoming one of the most efficient and functional note-taking apps for devices running on Android OS. With this app, Google takes on the likes of the other most popular note-taking app, Evernote. There were rumors flying around for a while reporting that Google Keep would come with an ability to pin notes. To add to these speculations, there were teardowns of other apps which clearly indicated that Google Keep would be joining the bandwagon to pin notes. The Google Keep has been updated to bring in one of the most required features – Note taking, the ability to pin down notes. The app lets the users take notes and keeps them organized in an essentially neat manner. Google Keep automatically generates search topics based on the content of the notes, which makes searching for notes easy instead of having to scroll through the hundreds of notes that have been saved. For example, if the user makes a note of a recipe, then the app will save it under the “Food” category. The categorization will be done automatically and will not require any specific input from the user. However, the users can add their own labels to the categories. The users can then just tap on the category and look for the required note. How to Do It All the users need to do to pin a note is just long press a note and then click on the pin button which will be displayed in the top bar of the app page on the screen. All the pinned notes will appear in the pinned section on top of the other notes. Apart from the ability to pin notes, Google Keep also brings with it the ability to add shortcuts to the app. This feature will go live as soon as the new version of the Android 7.1 Nougat OS update has arrived. Google has started to update their apps with this new update. The Google Clock upgraded version 4.6 has received this update already and it is on the way to make it to many other apps. Google Keep will now allow its users to access certain features directly on the app like New List, New Note, New Audio Note, and New Photo Note. This is indeed a very interesting update and is available for both Android and iOS versions of the Google Keep app. So, it is time to get the app updated soon.

So far we've seen a Halloween costume, a GTA V prank and an iPhone case depicting the discontinued handset. Now, even US President Barack Obama, who's been slyly upping his comedy game these last few months, has taken a shot at the Note 7. On Thursday, while speaking in Miami, he suddenly skewed off course to make an analogy about phones when discussing the Affordable Care Act (ie, ObamaCare). Advertisement - Continue Reading Below This is a simultaneous 🔥🔥🔥 on Samsung, Republicans and rotary phones. pic.twitter.com/HkHJeUfbL7 — Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) October 20, 2016 "If the phone has a few bugs, he said, they don't throw it away. They fix it. They upgrade it," Obama begins the explanation. Then, with a trademark giggle, he added: "Unless it catches fire. Then you pull it off the market." Damn, somebody out there apply cold water to the searing burn Samsung just received, please. Obama continued by saying: "But you don't go back to using a rotary phone. You don't say, 'Well, we're repealing smartphones. We're just gonna do the dial-up thing.' That's not what you do." It's not yet clear if Samsung will or won't release a rotary phone as a result of the Note 7 saga, with rumours actually indicating at this stage that the Galaxy S8 will steal certain features from the failed smartphone. Oh, and don't expect any more Note-related mishaps next year for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton to join in on, with Samsung reportedly set to only release one flagship in 2017.

A new iFixit teardown of the Pixel XL handset, outed by Google earlier this month, offers “almost zero evidence of this phone’s HTC manufacturing origin.” Without acknowledgement of the manufacturing partner on the outside of the device, Google has also done a pretty good job of hiding HTC’s involvement on the inside. The only place you’ll see an HTC logo is on the battery pack. Related: Google Pixel vs Pixel XL: Is bigger better? HTC says it was proud to build the phone for Google, but given the positive reviews offered to the Google Pixel, the firm could really have used some of the credit. Even more unfortunately for HTC, whose smartphone sales are falling considerably, this happens to be the most fixable smartphone it has ever made, according to iFixit. In that department, it gets a 6/10 rating (via 9to5Google). Elsewhere another destructive look at the Pixel handset from JerryRigs, has revealed the front speaker grill is actually made from cloth and can be punctured. Be careful, folks. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, both made by HTC, are available now. Google Pixel Phones hands on Have you snapped up a Pixel phone yet? Share your personal reviews in the comments below.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Google Pixel gets torn asunder by iFixit Behold the wonder of the HTC-manufactured, Google-designed Android flagship. by Ron Amadeo - Oct 21, 2016 10:57 pm UTC Login to bookmark 84 A rite of passage for any new smartphone is to eventually find itself on iFixit's teardown bench, and today the site gutted Google's newest smartphone, the Pixel XL. There weren't too many surprises inside Google's $750 device. During disassembly, the site actually broke the Samsung-made OLED panel, noting "the OLED panel separated from the digitizer glass a little too easily for our liking. Super-thin components and no frame or bezel behind the display make it extra sketchy to remove." On the plus side for repairability, the OLED panel isn't bonded to the glass, so you can replace just the broken glass instead of having to buy another expensive OLED. Under the display, iFixit found a "slim and flexible" magnesium mid-frame that hides most of the components. Buried under that you'll find a (hopefully non-explosive) HTC-branded battery—the only sign of the device's true manufacturer—along with Samsung-provided storage and RAM. Interestingly, like the Nexus devices last year, the Pixel contains a Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 chip despite not actually being QC 3.0 compatible—it uses USB-PD. The phone earned a 6 out of 10 for repairability. On the plus side, iFixit found many modular components that can be easily replaced, along with an easily-removable battery and a single screw size. It cited the fragile display and clip-in mid-frame as items that will slow down any would-be phone repairers. The pictures are always the best part; see the Pixel XL stripped down over at iFixit. Expand full story Reader comments 84 You must login or create an account to comment.

SUBSCRIBE Direct answer fail: Google gives only one side of proposed gun ammo & magazine law It's yet another example of Google going broad for answers and having problems. Danny Sullivan on October 21, 2016 at 2:13 pm More Want to know about California’s Proposition 63, a measure to control gun ammunition sales and large magazines, which is on the state ballot this month? Google has the answer. It’s a “deceptive ballot initiative that will criminalize millions of law-abiding Californians.” So much for balanced search results. Google presents that answer at the very top of its results, when searching for “Prop 63” or “Proposition 63,” as shown below: To answer “What’s happening here,” as Medium CEO Ev Williams asked when spotting this four days ago: for all its smarts, Google is still pretty dumb. Over the years, Google has increased the frequency of showing direct answers in its search results — something it calls “Featured Snippets.” The idea is that mobile users especially want fast facts, not to have to click through to a website. That’s even a potential advantage in its forthcoming Google Home assistant. It should allow Google Home to answer questions well beyond rival Amazon Echo, because Google will rely on the entire web rather than a more limited set of curated resources, especially Wikipedia. For example, here’s Google Home answering a question it found from the web, making use of featured snippets, that I’d previous tested with Amazon Echo, which couldn’t do it: This is a question Amazon Echo couldn't answer for me yesterday that Google Home got thanks to the web & featured snippets #MadeByGoogle pic.twitter.com/50E0HtypLA — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) October 4, 2016 (NOTE: the video above might not show due to temporary problems Twitter is having). To get these answers, Google effectively guesses (even with all that machine learning) at which site it thinks might have a definitive answer. But the downside is that when Google goes wide beyond curated sources, it makes mistakes. God only loves Christians. Dinosaurs are an indoctrination tool. A not-safe-for-work answer for eating sushi. These are real things that Google featured snippets have gotten wrong in the past. Heck, Google still will tell you that Barack Obama is “King of the United States” based on our own article about how a featured snippet originally screwed up this answer. These types of mistakes are embarrassing in web search results. They’re going to be even worse with Google Home, where Google will start reading aloud some of these crazy answers without at least the back-up of other search results. Potentially, that could even hinder the product. Indeed, as Google Home increases the attention that featured snippets get, it’s not unlikely that we might see companies actively working to spam them (more than they do now), or even rival groups trying to obtain their “side” as the preferred answer that Google gives. We’ve asked Google for comment and will update if one comes. About The Author Danny Sullivan Danny Sullivan is a Founding Editor of Search Engine Land.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel survives 30 minutes fully submerged in water Brittany A. Roston - Oct 21, 2016 3 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Google Pixel isn’t terribly water resistant in any official capacity with a rating of IP53, which is one of the downsides in comparison to other high-end competing handsets. Someone recently did a water test, though, and found that Google’s new smartphone held up pretty well to water exposure, including water submersion. Of course, we’re only seeing the short-term effects and not what problems may appear later, so don’t try this at home, folks. The test you see in the video below involves a trio of exposure scenarios, one spritzing the phone with water from what appeared to be a spray bottle, another submerging it somewhat in a puddle for a little while, and then another involving dunking it in a bowl of water for half an hour. Spoiler alert: the Google Pixel survives all three. The Pixel appears to be working perfectly fine after spending some time in the bowl, with the screen working well and there being no sign of water damage (though he didn’t specify whether the camera lens survived without moisture). Of course, you don’t want to get your phone wet, and don’t think Google’s lying when it says the phone only has an IP53 rating. There’s a good chance this phone will develop some issues later on related to the water exposure, something anyone who has gotten a non-resistant phone wet — only to experience phantom screen taps and charging problems later on — can tell you. Even if this phone does ultimately survive unscathed, that doesn’t mean your phone will survive its own dunking — especially if it’s in a more serious scenario, such as you falling into a swimming pool with the phone in your pocket.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards What is Google Chromecast and why should you care? Elyse Betters21 October 2016TV Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google Chromecast is a device you can use to send things from a small screen to your big screen TV. It's super easy to figure out, set up, and use. With it, you can send a YouTube video on your phone to a TV, or you can send a website on your computer to your TV. And that's just two of the possibilities. To help you learn what Google Chromecast is, how it works, and what it can do, Pocket-lint has explained everything you need to know about the affordable HDMI dongle. What is Chromecast? Google launched the first $30 (£30) Chromecast in 2013. It's an affordable HDMI dongle that lets you wirelessly "cast" content to a television. It basically makes most TVs smart. Then, in 2015, Google launched $30 Chromecast 2. It's faster, more responsive, and just as affordable. And it arrived with an updated Chromecast app that serves as a one-stop shop for finding compatible apps and specific content across those apps. In 2016, Google introduced the $69 (about £50) Chromecast Ultra, which works identically to its predecessors but uniquely offers the ability to cast 4K streams. Google also offers a $35 Chromecast Audio. Unlike the other three Chromecasts, Audio lets you wirelessly "cast" to speakers. That means your old speakers will essentially be turned into modern day speakers capable of playing music streamed from your devices. For more information on Chromecast, check out these guides: Chromecast 2 review: Make any TV smart, effortlessly What is Google Cast for Audio? Chromecast now has a guest mode: Here's how to turn on the feature Roku Streaming Stick vs Google Chromecast Amazon Fire TV Stick vs Google Chromecast vs Roku Streaming Stick How does Chromecast work? Requirements In order for Chromecast to work, you need to plug it into an HDMI input on a TV/display as well as an open USB port on your TV/display (or an open power wall outlet). You also need a compatible Android device or iOS device with the latest version of the Google Cast app installed, or you need a compatible Windows computer, Mac computer, or Chromebook computer with the latest version of the Chrome browser installed. It's important that your Chromecast and device or computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Otherwise, you cannot cast to your TV. Set up Chromecast Check out Pocket-lint's separate guide on how to set up Chromecast. The process involves plugging your Chromecast device into your TV's HDMI port and a power source (either via USB on your TV our a wall outlet), then in installing the Google Cast mobile app on your mobile device to begin the setup process, and following the app's setup instructions (also available here). The app will automatically find your Chromecast and prompt you to connect it to the same Wi-Fi network connected to your mobile device. You can also set up Chromecast to work with your computer. Simply install the Chrome browser on computer, and then navigate to chromecast.com/setup from the browser to setup Chromecast (or you can quickly install the Google Cast extension). Google Chromecast: How to set up Chromecast and get started with it Things you can do With Chromecast, you can cast movies, TV shows, and photos from Cast-enabled apps on Android smartphones, Android tablets, iPhones, and iPads. You can also cast entire sites or tabs from the Chrome browser on Windows desktops, Windows laptops, Mac desktops, Mac laptops, and Google Chromebooks. There's no remote required. To manage your Chromecast, use the Google Cast app or Google Cast browser extension. You can also cast your Android screen to your TV. Simply open the Google Cast app and tap the navigation drawer. From there, tap the Cast Screen button and select your Chromecast device. How to cast Check out Pocket-lint's separate guide on how to cast with Chromecast. But in a nutshell, all you have to do - once you set up Chromecast - is tap the Cast button from a Cast-enabled app such as YouTube on your mobile device, and the content will instantly appear on your big TV. From Chrome browser on your computer, you can also tap the Cast button in a video player like YouTube. Although it's not required, you can install the Google Cast extension in order to get the Cast icon in your browser toolbar. From there, simply click the icon, then choose the Chromecast device you would like to cast to, and wait for the contents of your tab in Chrome to appear on your TV. Which apps and sites are Cast-enabled? Google Apps Casting to your TV is a simple way to enjoy your mobile apps on a big screen. You can even use your mobile device or tablet as a remote and control everything from playback to volume. Within the Google Cast app, you can tap What’s On to browse content from Cast-enabled apps you’ve already installed. You can also tap Get Apps to find Cast-enabled apps you haven'y installed yet. Visit the Google's website to see a list of all Cast-enabled apps. Examples include Netflix, Spotify, HBO Now, Hulu, Angry Birds with Friends, Watch ESPN, Google Photos, YouTube, PBS Kids, Twitch, Pandora, and thousands more. Sites Some websites are Cast-enabled. Currently, YouTube, Netflix, Google Play Movies, Google Play Music, and more are Cast-enabled (see the full list here), and Google said it is adding new ones all the time. You will you know if a website is Cast-enabled when you see the Cast button on the website within the video player. For sites that are not Google Cast-enabled, you can use the Cast extension to view the content on your TV. Why should you care about Chromecast? Sometimes it's just fun to experience things on a bigger display. Let's say you're hanging out with friends and want to show them all a funny YouTube video. Instead of huddling around your phone, you can cast it to your TV and enjoy it on the big screen. Similarly, maybe you want to show your friends a cool website. Instead of crowding around a laptop, you can cast the site to your TV. It's easy to see the benefits of Chromecast. Plus, it's cheap and simple to use.

CDT October 21, 2016 PORTLAND, OR - MARCH 25: A bird lands on Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders podium as he speaks on March 25, 2016 in Portland, Oregon.  (Photo: Natalie Behring/Getty Images, 2016 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the race and endorsed Hillary Clinton, but Google data suggests he still might get a bunch of write-in votes on Election Day. According to Google, search interest in "write-in" has been surging nationwide. Google provides this data on a 0-100 scale. In mid-August, national search traffic for "write-in" hovered in the mid 40s; in October it has bounced around in the 80s and 90s, hitting a peak of 100 on Oct. 13. That was the day The New York Times published allegations from four women that Trump had made unwanted sexual advances many years ago. Sanders was the top mentioned candidate in "write-in" searches in 6 of 10 states with the highest "write-in" search intensity in October. Republican alternative Evan McMullin took the top spot in one of these states — Oklahoma — and in the three others, there was not enough data about individual searches for Google to release the data. Each state has its own rules for presidential write-in ballots, and only a handful allow write-in votes for candidates who have not registered their names. But among that handful are New Jersey, Vermont, Rhode Island and New Hampshire — the very states showing highest search interest in "write-ins" and where Sanders is the top searched name. Of course, since Sanders isn't actually running for president anymore, a flurry of write-in Bernie votes seem unlikely to have any impact on the race. Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by an average of about 7 points in the polls in the New Hampshire, and the other states are considered very safe Democratic territory. But it would be an interesting sign of Democratic dissatisfaction if Sanders takes a significant number of write-in votes in deep blue New Jersey or Vermont. More interesting could be the alternative Republican Evan McMullin, who is actively campaigning for write-in votes in several states. McMullin is the top searched candidate in "write-in" searches in Ohio and Arizona, two states where Clinton and Trump are essentially tied in the polls, and in both states, McMullin is a registered write-in candidate with an active ground operation, said adviser Joel Searby. Both states are in the top 20 for "write-in" search interest, according to Google. "We have state chairmen in both to get out the vote," Searby said. "We think we can impact the election in Ohio, Arizona, Wisconsin and Wyoming as a write-in." Clinton leads maintained a lead over Trump of about 7 points in recent Wisconsin polls, and Trump had a 35-point lead in an August Wyoming poll. Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News, warns that in some states write-in votes are allowed but election officials don't bother reporting the totals. "Iowa has never reported any presidential write-in votes in history," Winger said, and in New Hampshire the secretary of state "makes an arbitrary decision which write-in presidential candidates to include" in public reports.   CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Trump gives first interview since winning presidential election Chili's accused of taking meal from veteran Mom investigated after video goes viral, sparks outrage Federal lawsuit filed over injured HPD inmate 2 dead in shooting outside mall Local astronaut, 64, still hits weekly hockey league SUV crashes into SmashBurger restaurant Episode 1: Vision Impaired Episode 3: Instant Replay More Stories Anti-Trump protester accused of punching police… Nov 14, 2016, 1:32 p.m. Lawsuit: Cop used excessive force against HPD inmate Nov 14, 2016, 11:37 a.m. One dead, 1 injured in SW Houston shooting Nov 14, 2016, 4:17 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Googling Clinton and Trump from A to Z Gary Craig , @gcraig1 8:22 p.m. EDT October 21, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Google searches, by no means scientific, can provide some insight into just what people are wondering. And people have been wondering a lot about the presidential candidates. (Oct. 21, 2016) Len LaCara Is Trump/Clint a ...... (Photo: .) The question "Is Clinton friends with Trump?" apparently has been asked of Google millions of times. As has the question "Is Trump Canadian?" Google searches, by no means scientific, can provide some insight into just what people are wondering. And the presidential election — a vitriolic and occasionally crass campaign between two unpopular candidates — has prompted hundreds of millions of Google questions about Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Can we learn anything from those searches? Maybe a little.  Regardless, at least we can inject some fun into a campaign markedly devoid of levity. So, here's what we did at the Democrat and Chronicle. We decided to take an open-ended question about the candidates and run it through the Google search engine from A to Z. For example, for the Democratic candidate the question began like this: Is Clinton ... ? Then, we typed in each letter of the alphabet individually, to see the common searches with that letter. For instance, the search "Is Clinton a ..." brought up the most searched question as "Is Clinton ahead?" We did the same search for Trump and the top-ranked question for the letter A was: "Is Trump ahead in Ohio?" Some explaining is needed here. Using this method, the Google searches do not immediately bring up the most popular searches in each instance. But, this being an unscientific approach to an unscientific ranking, we simply used the top three responses to our questions. If we don't list three responses here, it's either because some of the responses were so similar or Google didn't come up with three letter-specific answers about the candidates. (In some cases, there were no responses, or responses that had nothing to do with the candidates.) So, here they are, the candidate-specific questions and the Google responses by alphabet: A Is Clinton ahead of Trump in the polls? Is Clinton a good debater? Is Trump ahead in Ohio? Is Trump a fascist? Is Trump against unions? B Is Clinton beating Trump? Is Clinton behind in the polls? Is Clinton better? Is Trump beating Clinton? Is Trump banned from Canada? C Is Clinton Cash on Netflix? (This is the film alleging a vast pay-to-play conspiracy between the Clintons and some foreign governments.) Is Clinton Catholic? Is Clinton Cash on DVD? Is Trump Canadian? Is Trump campaigning today? Is Trump catching up? D Is Clinton dropping out? Is Clinton dead? Is Clinton Democrat? Is Trump dead? Is Trump dropping out? Is Trump Democrat? E (Clinton had nothing with e.) Is Trump electable? Is Trump ethical? Is Trump exhausted? F Is Clinton friends with Trump? (There is some crossover here, with the question posed about different members of the Clinton and Trump families.) Is Clinton Foundation under investigation? Is Clinton Foundation a charity? Is Trump for TPP? (This relates to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.) Is Trump funding his own campaign? Is Trump fascist? G Is Clinton going to win? Is Clinton going to lose? Is Trump going to be president? Is Trump gaining in the polls? H Is Clinton holding a walker? Is Clinton hawkish? Is Trump healthy? Is Trump hurting his business? Is Trump having a rally today? I Is Clinton in the lead? Is Clinton in favor of TPP? Is Clinton Irish? Is Trump in the lead? Is Trump imploding? Is Trump intelligent? J (No response with Clinton and j.) Is Trump just a distraction? (Other searches related to Donald Trump Jr., including the question, "Is Trump Jr. married?") K (For Clinton, the letter K brings up multiple questions about Clinton Kelly, one of the hosts of the ABC show The Chew.) Is Trump KGB? Is Trump killing the GOP? Is Trump Keynesian?

Here’s how to disable it Google in June deleted a clause in its privacy settings that said it would not combine cookie information with personal information without consent Google has users’ (mostly) real names, email accounts and search data. Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters Olivia Solon in San Francisco Friday 21 October 2016 18.48 EDT Last modified on Monday 24 October 2016 12.56 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Since Google changed the way it tracks its users across the internet in June 2016, users’ personally identifiable information from Gmail, YouTube and other accounts has been merged with their browsing records from across the web. An analysis of the changes conducted by Propublica details how the company had previously pledged to keep these two data sets separate to protect individuals’ privacy, but updated its privacy settings in June to delete a clause that said “we will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent”. ProPublica highlights that when Google first made the changes in June, they received little scrutiny. Media reports focused on the tools the company introduced to allow users to view and manage ad tracking rather than the new powers Google gained. DoubleClick is an advertising serving and tracking company that Google bought in 2007. DoubleClick uses web cookies to track browsing behaviour online by their IP address to deliver targeted ads. It can make a good guess about your location and habits, but it doesn’t know your true identity. Have you given Pokémon Go full access to everything in your Google account? Read more Google, on the other hand, has users’ (mostly) real names, email accounts and search data. At the time of the acquisition, a number of consumer groups made a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission arguing that bringing these data sets together would represent a huge invasion of privacy, giving the company access to more information about the internet activities of consumers than any other company in the world. Sergey Brin reassured privacy campaigners, saying: “Overall, we care very much about end-user privacy, and that will take a number one priority when we talk about advertising products.” In 2012, Google made a controversial update to its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services, but it kept DoubleClick separate. In practice, this means that Google can now, if it wanted to, build up even richer profiles of named individuals’ online activity. It also means that the DoubleClick ads that follow people on the web could be personalized based on the keywords that individuals use in Gmail. Google isn’t the first company to track individuals in this way. Facebook has been tracking logged-in users (and even non-users) by name across the internet whenever they visit websites with Facebook “like” or “share” buttons. Google says that the change is optional and is aimed at giving people better control over their data. “Google is actually quite late to this game. By now, most of the websites you visit are already sharing your activity with a wide network of third parties who share, collaborate, link and de-link personal information in order to target ads,” said Jules Polonetsky from Future of Privacy Forum. “Some users may appreciate relevant advertising, many others may not. What’s critical is that there are easy ways for those who want to avoid the more robust types of data targeting to be able to take easy steps to do so.” Facebook admits it tracks non-users, but denies claims it breaches EU privacy law Read more Technology companies argue that such tracking allows them to deliver much more targeted, relevant advertising across the internet. Paul Ohm from the Center of Privacy and Technology at Georgetown law school told Propublica that the fact that Google kept personally identifiable information and DoubleClick data separate was “a really significant last stand”. “It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy. That wall has just fallen.” A Google spokeswoman said that its advertising system had been designed before the smartphone revolution, and that the update in June made it easier for users to control their ad preferences across multiple devices. The company says that more than one billion Google users have accessed the ‘My Account’ settings that let them control how their data is used. “Before we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency,” Google said. “As a result, it is 100% optional - if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged. Equally important: we provided prominent user notifications about this change in easy-to-understand language as well as simple tools that let users control or delete their data.” Users that don’t want to be tracked in this way can visit the activity controls section of their account page on Google, unticking the box marked “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services”.

Google's Unplugged service, meanwhile, looks to join in those ranks, and it's just added a major new draw to its operations: CBS. The newest reports suggest that Google's Unplugged—which will start on YouTube in the early going of 2017—will have CBS, and may have most of the other major networks following along. Deals with Fox, NBC, and ABC parent company Walt Disney may be in the offing. The Unplugged service will offer “skinny” bundles of live channels for between $25 and $40 a month, depending on what's all selected. The bad news, of course, is that Google will be arriving late to a very crowded party. Netflix and Hulu already have a big part of the subscription market, and with skinny bundles coming from companies like Dish Network with its Sling TV and Sony with its PlayStation Vue, Google may have a tough time on its hands convincing users to step away from current bundles and come over to a similarly-priced bundle. If it can offer better streaming, and lower bandwidth use, it may well manage to land some users. I tried Sling TV myself not so long ago and found the experience poor at best, with a lot of lag and similar issues; it wasn't even close to a match for Netflix streaming. Google will have one clear advantage on its hands; by playing on YouTube, there will be a lot of users in that neck of the woods already, and signing up even a comparatively slim number of said users means quite a bit of value. Individual channels on YouTube have millions of subscribers; if Google can get the equivalent of Markiplier's subscriber count shelling out $25 a month, that's better than a quarter-billion bucks monthly in the coffers. That's good, because Google's got another problem: at $25-$40, Google isn't even technically the value provider. Dish Network, for example, starts off its Top 120 package for $54.99 per month. This package contains over 190 channels total. Meanwhile, its own skinny bundle, the Flex Pack, matches Google's top price of $39.99 and offers over 50 channels with customization options. So for Google to really be able to compete, it's either going to have to drop some prices, offer content that can't be had elsewhere, or offer a whole lot more of it. Offering channels that most anyone can get with an outdoor aerial antenna for free will not do the job. Google likely knows the challenges it will face offering up this new skinny bundle, and has planned accordingly. If Google's final offering looks too much like its competitors, though, it may not manage to do more than skim the market, and end up an also-ran in the field.

October 20th 2016 a month ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Google’s own Pixel phone is one of several Android smartphones competing for customers in the wake of Samsung’s Galaxy Note7 recall. Picture: Ramin Talaie/Getty Images/AFP Jennifer Dudley-NicholsonNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend MORE THAN 50,000 Australians are suddenly in the market for a new smartphone, and major companies are falling over themselves to woo them. Samsung abandoned its popular but fire-prone Galaxy Note7 smartphone last week, leaving those who bought it weighing up a refund, exchange, whether to invest in a different Android phone, or a switch to Apple. HIDDEN FEATURES: 13 secret features of the Google Pixel that you won’t find in a manual TRIPLE THREAT: Sony’s latest phone comes with three camera sensors But Google Android phone makers are doing all they can to prevent that last eventuality, with three top-of-the-line phones out this week in Australia. Samsung’s withdrawal from the smartphone market in the run to Christmas is significant, as the South Korean tech giant was a Google Android champion. Sony's Xperia XZ smartphone features a 5.2-inch (13.2cm) screen, and a 23-megapixel camera with two extra sensors (laser autofocus and an infra-red sensor) for better photographs.Source:Supplied Kantar Worldpanel revealed Android phones made up six in every 10 smartphones sold in Australia in the three months to August, jumping in popularity by more than nine per cent. Most of those Android smartphones were made by Samsung, making this an unprecedented opportunity for rival phone makers to make their mark. Strangely, Google is one of those companies, having launched two of its own phones on Thursday. Kantar Worldpanel ComTech consumer insight director Lauren Guenveur says Google is likely to see more new customers from Samsung than Apple. “The Pixel announcement could not have come at a better time for Google, with Samsung suspending production of the beleaguered Galaxy Note 7 and instructing users to power down the device and stop using it,” she says. “(Google’s phones are) likely to steal share away from other Android brands, namely Samsung and Motorola.” The new Google Pixel phone features a metal body and distinctive glass panel on its back. Picture: AP Photo/Eric RisbergSource:AP The Pixel ($1079) and Pixel XL ($1269) are touted as the “first phones made by Google,” and feature new software, artificial intelligence engine Google Assistant, fingerprint scanners, 12.3-megapixel cameras with high DxOMark scores, and a 5-inch (12.7cm) and 5.5-inch (13.97cm) screen respectively. The handsets will also be the first Google phones sold through an Australian carrier, with Telstra offering the devices on a 24-month plans. Google is not the only Android offering in the game, though. Sony launched its new flagship smartphone, the Xperia XZ ($999), on the same day, touting a water-resistant body, fingerprint scanner, smart battery charging and, notably, a 23-megapixel camera with two extra sensors to speed up autofocus and deliver accurate colours. Sony Mobile Communications Oceania managing director John Featherstone said the Note7 recall could shake up what has become “a very polarised” market. “You would think that given some of the challenges other companies have had, it would certainly make (the Xperia XZ) a viable alternative,” he says. “It’s got all the specs, it’s still going to be best in class when it comes to camera, it will be best in class around battery design, and it’s got all the other elements like high-res audio and remote gaming.” Motorola is weighing into the battle too with its first high-end flagship in a long time. The $999 Moto Z boasts a 5.5-inch (13.97cm) display, 64GB storage, 13-megapixel camera, super slim design, and fingerprint scanner. But its most innovative additions are its Mods, or magnetised accessories, that add a speaker, projector, extra battery, or even a Hasselblad camera on to its rear panel. Lenovo's Moto Z smartphone is the company's first flagship, high-end handset in some time and has a unique take on accessories.Source:Supplied Motorola Mobility Australia general manager Danny Adamopolous says the new flagship is designed to take on the big guys. “We want to take advantage of the current situation and ride the wave,” he says. “Having a premium product will allow us to do that.” Add your comment to this story Comments Form Enter your comment here * 1200 characters left Your details Name (as it will appear on the site)* Email Address * Location (optional) Post Options Remember my details Email me if my comment is published News.com.au's Privacy Policy includes important information about our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information (including to provide you with targeted content and advertising based on your online activities).

More people are searching Google via smartphone than ever before the company says, with the most popular categories revolving around health, parenting, and beauty. Other top findings from Google’s study include: 80% of people use a smartphone 67% of people use a desktop computer 16% of people use a tablet 57% of people use more than one type of device 27% of people use a smartphone only 14% of people use a desktop computer only Dissecting these findings, it’s interesting to learn that of the people who only use one type of device, twice as many are using smartphones than desktop computers. On top of that, people who use smartphones use them a lot — up to 3 hours a day. By comparison, an average of 2 hours a day is spent using desktop computers, and 75 minutes is spent using tablets. That’s fairly solid evidence that we are living in a mobile-first world now more than ever. Google warns marketers that if you’re not making an attempt to reach customers on mobile you’re missing a quarter of your potential audience. ”We live in a world where people literally expect answers at their fingertips, and to find them, they’re turning to the nearest device” Desktop computers’ time to shine is around 8am, which is right around the time people may be starting their work day. Smartphone usage then takes over in the afternoon with a particular increase being seen around prime time viewing hours. Smartphone usage is said to be consistent throughout the day, peaking around noon and being used steadily during the afternoon and into the night. “There’s never really an off time”, Google says. Throughout 15 of the 24 hours in a given day, more searches are happening on mobile than on computers or tablets. Google’s data is based on findings from a behavioral measurement of 11,964 opt-in Google users between January 1, 2016, and March 31, 2016. Opt-in users include a U.S. demographic of 18 to 49-year-old cross-device users. More details from Google’s study can be read here in this PDF.

Customers can. › The problem for people isn’t advertising, and the problem for advertising isn’t blocking. The problem for both is tracking. October 21, 2016 in adtech, advertising, Business, Identity, Internet, Journalism, Law, marketing, privacy, problems, publishing, security | 4 comments In Google Has Quietly Dropped Ban on Personally Identifiable Web Tracking, @JuliaAngwin and @ProPublica unpack what the subhead says well already: “Google is the latest tech company to drop the longstanding wall between anonymous online ad tracking and user’s names.” So here’s a message from humanity to Google and all the other spy organizations in the surveillance economy: Tracking is no less an invasion of privacy in apps and browsers than it is in homes, cars, purses, pants and wallets. That’s because our apps and browsers, like the devices on which we use them, are personal and private. Simple as that. (HT to @Apple for digging that fact.) To help the online advertising business understand what ought to be obvious (but isn’t yet), let’s clear up some misconceptions: Tracking people without their clear and conscious permission is wrong. (Meaning The Castle Doctrine should apply online no less than it does in the physical world.) Assuming that using a browser or an app constitutes some kind of “deal” to allow tracking is wrong. (Meaning implied consent is not the real thing. See The Tradeoff Fallacy: How Marketers Are Misrepresenting American Consumers and Opening Them Up to Exploitation, by Joseph Turow, Ph.D. and the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.) Claiming that advertising funds the “free” Internet is wrong. (The Net has been free for the duration. Had it been left up to the billing companies of the world, we never would have had it, and they never would have made their $trillions on it. More at New Clues.) What’s right is civilization, which relies on manners. Advertisers, their agencies and publishers haven’t learned manners yet. But they will. At the very least, regulations will force companies harvesting personal data to obey those they harvest it from, with fines for not obeying. Toward that end, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation already has compliance offices at large corporations shaking in their boots, for good reason: “a fine up to 20,000,000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher (Article 83, Paragraph 5 & 6).” Those come into force in 2018. Stay tuned. Companies harvesting personal data also shouldn’t be surprised to find themselves re-classified as fiduciaries, no less responsible than accountants, brokers and doctors for confidentiality on behalf of the people they collect data from. (Thank you, professors Balkin and Zittrain, for that legal and rhetorical hack. Brilliant, and well done. Or begun.) The only way to fully fix publishing, advertising and surveillance-corrupted business in general is to equip individuals with terms they can assert in dealing with others online — and to do it at scale. Meaning we need terms that work the same way across all the companies we deal with. That’s why Customer Commons and Kantara are working on exactly those terms. For starters. And these will be our terms — not separate and different ones that live at each company we deal with. Those aren’t working now, and never will work, because they can’t. And they can’t because when you have to deal with as many different terms as there are parties supplying them, the problem becomes unmanageable, and you get screwed. That’s why — There’s a new sheriff on the Net, and it’s the individual. Who isn’t a “user,” by the way. Or a “consumer.” With new terms of our own, we’re the first party. The companies we deal with are second parties. Meaning that they are the users, and the consumers, of our legal “content.” And they’ll like it too, because we actually want to do good business with good companies, and are glad to make deals that work for both parties. Those include expressions of true loyalty, rather than the coerced kind we get from every “loyalty” card we carry in our purses and wallets. When we are the first parties, we also get scale. Imagine changing your terms, your contact info, or your last name, for every company you deal with — and doing that in one move. That can only happen when you are the first party. So here’s a call to action. If you want to help blow up the surveillance economy by helping develop much better ways for demand and supply to deal with each other, show up next week at the Computer History Museum for VRM Day and the Internet Identity Workshop, where there are plenty of people already on the case. Then follow the work that comes out of both — as if your life depends on it. Because it does. And so does the economy that will grow atop true privacy online and the freedoms it supports. Both are a helluva lot more leveraged than the ill-gotten data gains harvested by the Lumascape doing unwelcome surveillance. Bonus links: All the great research Julia Angwin & Pro Publica have been doing on a problem that data harvesting companies have been causing and can’t fix alone, even with government help. That’s why we’re doing the work I just described. What Facebook Knows About You Can Matter Offline, an OnPoint podcast featuring Julia, Cathy O’Neill and Ashkan Soltani. Everything by Shoshana Zuboff. From her home page: “’I’ve dedicated this part of my life to understanding and conceptualizing the transition to an information civilization. Will we be the masters of information, or will we be its slaves? There’s a lot of work to be done, if we are to build bridges to the kind of future that we can call “home.” My new book on this subject, Master or Slave? The Fight for the Soul of Our Information Civilization, will be published by Public Affairs in the U.S. and Eichborn in Germany in 2017.” Can’t wait.

Let’s tell consumers what we need to provide a better service and how it benefits them. Pingback from Doc Searls – The problem for people isn’t advertising, and the problem for advertising isn’t blocking – D’Arcy Norman dot net on October 23, 2016 at 11:06 am Doc Searls on October 24, 2016 at 7:51 am We’ve needed that all along, Warren. But it hasn’t happened. And when it does happen, it won’t work if every company does it a different way. What we need is for individuals to be the first party and companies the second party, and for companies to agree to terms we as first parties assert. This not only gives individuals scale across all the companies willing to agree (which in Europe they’ll have to once the GDPR gets teeth in 2018), but provides a much better market with much better conditions for both customers and companies. For example, if each of us has a #NoStalking term that says “just show me ads not based on tracking me”, publishers and broadcasters are not only off the hook with privacy regulations but in possession of a better demographic to sell to advertisers. sam d on October 27, 2016 at 7:27 pm Nice article, I use an ad-blocker on my browser too, I think tracking is a major concern among user rather than those annoying pop-up ads, there should be some way around these things such that we can have ads and not get tracked.

This front panel removal is the only method with which repair happen with this device, and it requires some heat. Once the rim of the front panel is hot, separation requires a bit of a pick and pull – therein lies the danger. When the front panel becomes removed in the incorrect way, it’ll separate with the swiftness. As iFixit shows, their first attempt at disassembly did not turn out well. This means the user will need to be extra outstandingly careful in trying to fix this device or replace any component therein. For now, this method is too dangerous to attempt. The rest of the teardown seems straightforward by comparison, save the “snug, press-fit notches” that hold the midframe in place. Everything else uses moderate amounts of adhesive or T5 Torx screws. It’s a shame the front is so difficult to remove without damage – the rest seems like a dream of ease. Inside you’ll find the one indicator that it wasn’t Google who put this device together. HTC’s own battery is inside, put there by Google’s manufacturer – HTC. SEE THIS: Google Pixel XL Review They’ve put this device together using parts from Qualcomm, NXP, Skyworks, and Samsung. Parts from Qualcomm include a PM8996, WTR3925 LTE RF transceiver, WCD9335 audio codec, and RF360 Dynamic Antenna Matching Tuner (QFE2550). Skyworks provided the quad-band power amp module (SKY77807), and there’s an Avago ACPM-7800 power amp in there too. Samsung provides the KLUBG4G1CE 32 GB flash storage (UFS 2.0). There’s a NXP TFA9891 smart audio amplifier inside this device as well as Samsung’s K3RG2G20BM-MGCJ 4 GB LPDDR4 mobile DRAM. It’s also confirmed that the Qualcomm SMB1350 Quick Charge 3.0 IC is present inside.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Google Changed a Major Privacy Policy Four Months Ago, and No One Really Noticed Google Changed a Major Privacy Policy Four Months Ago, and No One Really Noticed Slate Sign In Sign Up ASU | NEW AMERICA | SLATE Learn more about Future Tense » Slate Future Tense The Citizen's Guide to the Future Oct. 21 2016 4:06 PM Google Changed a Major Privacy Policy Four Months Ago, and No One Really Noticed By Suzanne Monyak   How closely do you read Google's privacy policies? Photo by LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images For almost 10 years, Google promised to protect users’ privacy from advertisers by keeping personally identifiable information about its users, gleaned from Gmail accounts and other Google services, separate from its subsidiary DoubleClick’s database of web-browsing records. But the company quietly updated its privacy policy in June to say that users’ activities on other sites “may be associated with your personal information,” ProPublica reported Friday. Google’s previous privacy policy, which is literally crossed through in front of its new one in Google’s new privacy policy, had pledged to “not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information” without users’ consent. Google Advertisement Google purchased DoubleClick, an online advertising company, in April 2007 for $3.1 billion in cash, outbidding Microsoft in a months-long battle. DoubleClick uses cookies to collect and store data about users from their browsing history to best place their clients’ advertisements. For example, a user who visits the sports section of a news site will be more likely to be shown ads for game tickets than ads for makeup. ProPublica’s Julia Angwin notes that at the time of the 2007 purchase, Google’s privacy policy stated that DoubleClick’s ad-serving technology will rely only on “non-personally-identifiable information,” which had allowed online ad tracking to remain anonymous. Angwin writes: The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on the keywords they used in their Gmail. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. Existing Google users were prompted to opt in to the new policy. But it was enabled by default for new users. You can view what Google thinks your interests are, and choose to opt out of personalized ads, here. In its privacy policy, Google states that it does not sell any personal information, such as names, email addresses and payment information. This summer’s change follows a long-term trend of decreasing privacy standards for Internet users. In 2000, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation of DoubleClick’s handling of sensitive user information after it purchased Abacus Direct, a company that sells consumer purchasing data. Although the FTC dropped the investigation in January 2002 and determined there had been no violation, DoubleClick sold its subsidiary at a loss. And then in 2012, Google announced that it would share data between other Google products, but still kept the data separate from DoubleClick. Unlike this most recent update, the 2012 change was mandatory for all Google users. So how will this affect your life? Probably not much, even if you’ve opted in to the new change, given that your Gmail content was already fair game for ads displayed within Gmail. But we are now one step closer to a world, imagined in Slate by Evan Selinger and Shaun Foster, in which advertisements on the street and screens morph into images of your own avatar using or wearing the product. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University.

NEW DELHI: Google is entering a space it has never been to before — the Indian mobile phone retail store. The company will directly sell its new Pixel smartphones to consumers through at least seven prominent large-format retail stores in India, besides multi-brand stores, and promote the flagship device just as much as top brands Apple and Samsung. And it's entering with a bang. Analysts expect Google to start with about 1 lakh devices — more than ever before — to make a dent in India's premium smartphone segment, which is dominated by Samsung and Apple. Until now, manufacturers of Google phones such as Nexus were responsible for marketing, which has been extremely low key and limited. Google is raising the stakes in the premium segment — Rs 30,000-plus — right after Samsung's huge setback with the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. Still, the search giant faces a huge challenge as Apple has already shipped in about 2 lakh units of its iPhone 7 ahead of Diwali. Samsung is redirecting its marketing budget to promote the S7 and S7 Edge. Bookings for the two Pixel models opened on October 13 through Flipkart and offline retailers. Google's marketing play is expected to escalate next week — before Diwali — although the launch date isn't known. Google is holding a media event on October 25. The 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL went on sale in the US a couple of days ago. "It's a shift of strategy (for Google), as it follows the make-your-ownphone plans, but it’s also required," said Santosh Desai, managing director of Future Brands. "Google is going up against formidable brands, so it can't go half-way on end-consumer communication…the Samsung (incident) opens up the opportunity for Google vs Apple, so all the more reason for them to go full throttle." Google is aware of the task at hand and plans to respond accordingly. "We will run a 360-degree above-theline campaign with TV, cinema, out-of-home in top seven metro cities, print and digital, to build the brand," a Google spokesperson said. Heavy spending is expected for spreading the word on the Pixel smartphones. The base model for Pixel costs Rs 57,000. Print advertisements will run for the next three to four months while television ad spots will target Hindi and English entertainment channels. Google will also use You-Tube and its other digital platforms to promote the devices. The Alphabet-owned company will showcase the Pixel and Pixel XL in key stores of large-format retail chains including Croma, Reliance Digital, Spice Mobility and Jumbo. Tie-ups with other chains, including The Mobile Store, are in the works, industry insiders said. "Displays for Pixel will be set up in top 50 stores of the total 300 that we have. They will carry the Google branding, something that a consumer would have not seen before," the chief executive officer of one retail chain said, asking not to be identified. A full-fledged strategy is necessary, especially in the premium segment, to convince users that Google can compete, said Jaipal Singh, a senior analyst at IDC India. It has failed in the past, a case in point being the Nexus 5X and 6P launched last year, which sold a combined less than a lakh units from October last year to date. Comparatively, an average of about 600,000 premium units are sold in the country each month. Cupertino-based Apple is spending about Rs 100 crore on marketing and advertising in India during the festive period, ET reported previously.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else. With so many voice-controlled, non-smartphone devices in our homes, it sure feels like we’re at a flux point. Also, the Google Assistant, which lives in the Pixel, is so so powerful, and we’re headed for more of that.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better. David’s feature story about Fitbit’s quest to get more people wearing Fitbits. David again on smartwatches and fitness trackers. Recommendations this week: Authy and the Garmin Forerunner 735XT.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants. David’s recommendation this week is Poisonfeather by Matthew Fitzsimmons. Michael recommends Amanda yerba mate.

For now, some of us still need powerful PCs. This week, we got to see that Microsoft and Apple are still intent on wowing our socks off when it comes to hardware for developers and creative professionals. With the new Surface Studio from Microsoft and the redesigned MacBook Pro from Apple, we’ve got some great options. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Surface Studio looks hot. So does the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Also see David’s hands-on report. Margaret Rhodes has some additional thoughts on the Touch Bar as well. There’s also a new Surface Book from Microsoft. David’s recommendation this week is Lessons From the Screenplay. Michael’s is the Jaybird X3 sweat-proof wireless earphones.

We bring in an expert, WIRED’s own Peter Rubin, to chart all of it. Peter manages WIRED’s culture and entertainment coverage and co-hosts The Monitor, our culture podcast. Peter is also well-steeped in face computers: he’s written stellar stories about Oculus and he’s been testing and ranking each new VR system as it’s released. With David out this week, Michael and Peter talk about PSVR, Google Daydream View, and the future of “untethered” real-deal VR. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Read Peter’s review of the Sony PlayStation VR headset and his report from last week’s Oculus Connect. Also, Chris Kohler writes about rhythm games and short-play games in VR. David Pierce has the details on Google’s phone-based Daydream View.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently. But, maybe it doesn’t work super-great just yet. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Watch Google’s presentation from Tuesday, and read our roundup of everything that was announced.

What we watch, what we watch it on, and what we do while we watch it. Not only is the technology of TV changing, but the content is morphing in a way that alters what we think of as “television.” Is a YouTube video TV? Sure, right. What about a Snapchat story, or a local city council meeting on Twitter? Yes—why not. The hosts discuss these changes in light of YouTube’s new app, Twitter’s new strategy, Snap’s new hardware, and Roku’s new future-proofed players. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David Pierce’s story on YouTube Go. The video from Vox about “the package” in Cuba. Brian Barrett on Snap Specs, and the WSJ feature that dropped suddenly. David also wrote about football on Twitter. Tim Moynihan’s rundown of the new boxes from Roku. David on Alto, the new email app from AOL. Easy, on Netflix.

Sam Lubell Design Date of Publication: 10.21.16. 10.21.16 Time of Publication: 3:58 pm. 3:58 pm Here’s How Self-Driving Cars Will Transform Your City SWA/Kinder Baumgardner Elon Musk says every new Tesla comes with all of the hardware needed for fully autonomous driving. He is hardly alone in trying to spare humans the tedium of car operation. Audi, GM, Google, and Uber are among the many companies working toward the day when autos do everything and you’re just along for the ride. Musk, ever the showman, plans to see one of his cars drive across the country next year without a human doing anything more than  enjoying the scenery. Others lay out more conservative timelines for rolling out their technology, but make no mistake—robocars are coming, and sooner than you think. This technology promises to radically remake the very form and fabric of our cities, even if it remains to be seen just what those changes will look like. We asked eight urban planners and futurists to share their visions of a driverless future. Carlo Ratti, Director, MIT Senseable City Lab Ratti, whose lab anticipates how technology will transform the built environment, predicts that vehicle automation will require 80 percent fewer cars on any given highway. “In general, fewer cars could mean shorter travel times, less congestion, and a smaller environmental impact,” Ratti says. “Vast areas of urban land currently occupied by parking lots and roads could be reinvented for a whole new spectrum of social functions” like parks, public spaces, and maker spaces. Cars, he adds, could also become extensions of our homes. But Ratti warns: “We can also have nightmarish scenarios. For instance, if self-driving were to become so cheap that people would prefer jumping into a car than, say, taking the subway. In that case our cities could easily become gridlocked.” Erick Guerra, assistant professor of city and regional planning, University of Pennsylvania “I think in urban environments it will lead to less driving and urban space will be used in a more positive way,” Guerra says. At the same time, he’s skeptical of the utopian claims that we’ll all be inherently better off. “If you’re living in a low density suburban community, they’re finding it will increase travel when you use existing travel models.” In other words: There are still a lot of unknowns. “It’s a really hard thing to quantitatively predict,” he says. “There’s a good deal of uncertainty in terms of how it influences urban form.” Anthony Townsend, author of Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia Townsend, who thinks a lot about how technology will impact cities and the people who inhabit them, argues that those studying the impacts of autonomous vehicles are focusing too much on passenger cars, and not enough on all the other self-driving vehicles that will soon pop up.”It’s actually trash trucks, trailers, delivery vans, taxis and other vehicles that take up much of the space in cities. They will be completely transformed by automated technologies,” he says. This change, along with automated mass transit, will make dense cities much more efficient and livable. But the technology, he adds, will also exacerbate sprawl unless legislators take action. “When you make an economic input cheaper, the net effect isn’t to use less. It’s to use a lot more of it. So without restrictions or disincentives, we’ll have more cars.” The good news: An automated vehicle whose software can be updated at any time can adapt dramatically over time. “There’s a lot more chances to get it right, because we can change it as we go along,” Townsend says. SWA/Kinder Baumgardner Kinder Baumgardner, managing principal, SWA Baumgardner, who leads landscape and urban design firm SWA’s Houston studio, recently published a paper entitled “Beyond Google’s Cute Car.” He predicts that a reduction in cars will transform urban cores, with entrepreneurs reimagining parking lots, parking spaces, and garages by converting them into housing, retail outlets, and public spaces. Already, he notes, garage operators are beginning to strategize how they can reuse or sell their properties. “Who knows, garages could become the cool place to live? You suddenly have an opportunity for space where it didn’t exist.” Suburbs, meanwhile, could become less isolated, as garages, driveways and cul-de-sacs become common spaces and walking replaces driving in town centers. “You’ll get to know your neighbors better,” says Baumgardner. “You’ll see changes pop up in an ad-hoc way.” Suburbs, he adds, will also become more desirable. “The one inconvenience, driving, goes away. There’s going to be more demand to live in those places.” David Ory, planning principal, San Francisco Metropolitan Transportation Commission Ory believes planners need to think broadly about how technology will change the urban environment, given how unpredictable it can be. “Instead of thinking about one future,” he asks, “do we think about dramatically different futures?” We won’t, he says, just have driverless cars, but automated, seamless systems for buses, subways, bicycles, and much more. The ideal scenario? A major reduction in land devoted to cars of all types—but that could vary widely based on an area’s resources. He also warns that we can get ahead of ourselves in planning for driverless cities. “There are a lot of revolutions that don’t come about. Driverless is the most promising, but it’s still somewhat speculative.” Jarrett Walker, president, Jarrett Walker + Associates Walker, a planning and transit consultant who has advised cities around the world, is also wary of utopian visions of the self-driving landscape. “A lot more money wants self-driving cars to be wonderful than wants us to remain skeptical,” he says.  He warns of induced demand: “If you make something easier, more people do it, so you have to think of the consequences of what it means for more people to do it.” That means there’s going to have to be a lot of regulation and intervention to manage this process to limit the otherwise devastating effects of induced demand. The real fight, in other words, will be policy-related. “The battle is to create a space in which the question is not how we get ready for self-driving vehicles but rather what kind of city we want.” Audi Lisa Futing, Project Manager, Audi Urban Futures Initiative “The biggest change to the urban fabric will be to parking infrastructure,” says Futing, whose initiative sponsors research collaborations with academic and cultural institutions dedicated to urban mobility. “Parking will be moved indoors and outside of city centers, freeing up outdoor lots and spaces for development and public space. Lots them will be able to accommodate 60 percent more cars thanks to smaller driving lanes, greater maneuverability, and a lack of need for stairs and elevators.” Brooks Rainwater, Senior Executive Director, Center For City Solutions, National League of Cities Rainwater warns that few cities are thinking about the problem of self-driving cars. His group has found that only 6 percent of the country’s major cities’ long-range transportation master plans consider them. His most novel prediction is that the traditional boundaries of the urban form—such as those between roads, sidewalks, and street walls— will begin to break down. “Through technology you can get to a point where you no longer need traffic lights or clear distinctions between roads and sidewalks. Our cities will be more data intense and human-centered. You can really see the urban form shifting in ways that are hard to imagine. Particularly in our densest cities.” Go Back to Top.

While die-hard iPhone users are adjusting to Apple’s questionable decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, Android enthusiasts are anticipating the late-October release of the Google Pixel. While Google has been behind the Android software for many years, Google Pixel represents a noticeable change in strategy as Google pushes to create its own mobile hardware. In the fiercely competitive smartphone industry, Google’s decision to vertically integrate from software into hardware development undoubtedly puts the company into even more direct competition with Apple. Apple and Google are widely regarded as the world’s leading firms in terms of innovation. As such, they have always had a friendly rivalry — whether it be Google Maps versus Apple Maps or Chrome versus Safari — the two firms have been able to remain indirect competitors because they fundamentally have operated in slightly different industries. Whereas Google has always   remained committed to its search engine services, Apple has focused on its constant reinvention of “smart” consumer products. However, the Google-branded Pixel phone now places the company directly in Apple iPhone territory. But why does it matter? Most of us already believe that the companies have been competing against one another, even if it has only been indirectly. This shift should be important to consumers because it represents the two most innovative firms going head to head in a way they never have before. Competition is at the heart of any free-market economy. When there is more than one producer of any given good or service, each producer is forced to constantly improve upon or differentiate its offering to remain relevant to consumers. As a result, competition inherently pushes firms to deliver superior service, lower prices or in rare cases, both, in order to acquire and retain consumers. Ultimately, when there are more firms competing in a given industry to deliver essentially the same good or service, consumers are the ultimate beneficiaries. Following this same principle, the launch of Google Pixel will provide virtually unparalleled benefits for consumers in the mobile communication industry. Since both Google and Apple are regarded as the best in what they do, competition directly against each other will push their creativity and innovation even further. As both Google and Apple now attempt to provide consumers with the best mobile hardware and software, better mobile devices will undoubtedly be produced. For consumers, this means that the competition between Google and Apple will ultimately leave us with better cell phones in the future than what we have available to use today. And that is a good thing. For the average consumer, mobile devices are likely to continue to advance in their specifications as companies like Google and Apple collide in research and development. In artificial intelligence, our devices will become more and more interactive, better able to understand us and to respond to our needs and preferences. In software, they will support a dizzying array of applications and features, allowing us to explore our world in new ways, seek further knowledge or further entertainment with massive memory banks that support all of our activities in storage. In hardware, the devices will also become faster, brighter and lighter as well as more and more rough-and-ready, able to be seamlessly integrated into any and all of our daily activities. They will speed along with us during our busiest working days and stay with us in our relaxation on quiet nights. A new world of possibility thus awaits the consumers of today if present trends of competition and innovation keep up. It will just be up to us to know how to adapt to it while keeping our priorities in line. So while Google Glass may have not been the most successful launch into hardware development for consumers, Google Pixel is sure to leave consumers much better off than we are right now.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Movies Home Follow Us Get Showtimes Trailers Role Recalls Star Wars Superfan Awards Season Celebrity Daydream Available for Pre-Order: What We Know About Google’s Virtual Reality Headset Janko Roettgers VarietyOctober 21, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google has opened up pre-orders for its Daydream View virtual reality headset on its web store this week. This comes as the company has started to sell its Pixel phone, which is the first phone to support Daydream. Google officially unveiled Daydream View at a press event earlier this month, but the company has been slow to release key details on the device. That being said, here is what we know so far about Daydream View: What it is: Daydream View is a mobile VR headset, which means that you’ll use a compatible phone as a display. It’s similar to Samsung’s Gear VR headset, with some notable differences: Daydream View is covered with cloth, which makes it a lot more comfortable. It also comes with an external controller that doubles as a Wii-like game pad, tracking motion for game play and other applications. Price and availability: Daydream View costs $79, and can already be pre-ordered via Google’s web store. It will also be sold at Best Buy and Verizon stores. There’s still no official launch date for the device, with Google only stating that it would be “coming this November,” but users who pre-order it on Google’s site are being told that it will ship within the next 2-3 weeks. Launch apps: Google promises that there will be more than 50 apps available for Daydream before the end of the year. Some of these apps will include Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, YouTube, NBA, MLB, CNN as well as VR apps from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian and USA Today. There will also be a Jaunt VR app and an app for Baobab’s “Invasion!” animated VR short film. Games will include “Eve Gunjack 2,” “Need for Speed No Limits,” “Lego Brick Headz Dream Builder,” and “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” Compatible phones: At launch, Daydream View will work with Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL phones. The headset isn’t limited to Google’s phones, and will over time also work with other VR-optimized Android smart phones from Daydream partners like Huawei, Asus, Samsung and Xiaomi. However, Daydream isn’t backwards compatible, so don’t expect to be able to use your Samsung S7 with the headset. Also not supported at all: Apple’s iPhones. Limitations: Daydream doesn’t support positional tracking, which essentially means that the headset doesn’t know where you are in a room, or which way you are moving. This means that many of the apps available on high-end VR headsets like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or PlayStation VR won’t work on Daydream. Also amiss from Daydream View is any kind of augmented reality. The headset fully covers your phone’s front-facing camera, so it’s impossible for apps to use the camera input for augmented reality experiences.

In addition to the usual stability improvements and bug fixes, the latest version of Google’s mobile browser for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch packs in a charming side-scrolling mini game that you can play when without an Internet connection. “No internet connection? Smile and tap the dinosaur,” tease release notes accompanying a 98.9-megabyte download. To unwind this hidden perk, put your device in Airplane Mode and visit any webpage in Chrome. You’ll see a “You are Offline” message and a charming little dinosaur. Tap the Dino to begin playing the retro-looking game. And here it is in action. Knowing Google, this was probably written in HTML5. At any rate, Chrome’s built-in dinosaur game should help shorten the wait for Nintendo’s Super Mario Run, an endless runner that was designed for one-handed play. Chrome is a free download from the App Store.

If you buy a Google Pixel or Pixel XL then take out the SIM tray and look very closely, you'll see... Wait, what is that? It's Google's address. To be specific, it's the address of Google's headquarters, though in slightly shortened form. The full thing is 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California, 94043, the United States of America. Why would you want to see Google's address every time you put a new SIM card into your Pixel? That's a good question, isn't it? And if you have the black model of either phone, the text is very readable and does stand out (it's less so with the silver versions). Could this be a semi-stealthy (or at least harder to find) nod to Apple's famous "Designed by Apple in California" inscription? Maybe. No one knows for sure - perhaps not even Google. But there you have it. Your Pixel comes with an apt reminder of the exact place on this Earth where its maker's HQ is located. See, you do learn something new every day.

I also discuss cases of Google Penguin 4.0 declines in rankings. Google still only uses HTTPS in the URL as the only qualifier for the ranking boost. Google said sitewide ranking scores are current state. Google said they do not have a website authority ranking score. Google said they do have a bunch of original source detection algorithms. Google said there is no reason to disavow blogroll links. There is also no Google Penguin boost. HTTP2 won’t help you rank better. Google has a new Google Search Console advisory board. Google AdWords launches click to message and affiliate location extensions. Google AdWords reports to soon show all shared reports bad default. The Google keyword planner tool now can import keywords from existing campaigns. That was this past week in search at the Search Engine Roundtable.

But 2017's looking up – there'll be loads of IPOs, beams Intel An extraordinary, focused attack on DNS provider Dyn continues to disrupt internet services for hundreds of companies, including online giants Twitter, Amazon, AirBnB, Spotify and others. The worldwide assault started at approximately 11am UTC on Friday. It was a massive denial-of-service blast that knocked Dyn's DNS anycast servers offline, resulting in knock-on impacts across the internet. Folks immediately started reporting problems; millions of people are affected. After two hours into the initial tidal wave of junk traffic, Dyn announced it had mitigated the assault and service was returning to normal. But the relief was short lived: just about an hour later, the attack resumed and at the time of writing (1800 UTC), not only is Dyn's service still down but its website is too. (Aptly, Dyn researcher Doug Madory had recently given a talk on DDoS attacks.) By blasting Dyn offline, public DNS providers – such as Google and broadband ISPs – are unable to contact Dyn to lookup hostnames for netizens, preventing people from accessing sites using Dyn for DNS. OpenDNS is about the only major public DNS provider weathering the storm – if you're having problems connecting to websites, you should use OpenDNS's resolvers at 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220. OpenDNS uses smart caching during outages to keep looking up hostnames even if the websites' backend DNS is flooded off the 'net. What's happening is basically this: your browser or app tries to connect to somewebsite.com using a public DNS resolver, such as Google's or your cable provider. That resolver tries to get hold of Dyn to lookup the IP address for somewebsite.com, but can't because Dyn's systems have been shoved offline so the resolver gives up. Your software therefore can't get an IP address to connect to and also gives up with an error message. Public DNS providers struggle to resolve websites amid the @Dyn DDoS. OpenDNS is holding up. Here’s servers trying to resolve Twitter pic.twitter.com/WrmBX35RX7 — The Register (@TheRegister) October 21, 2016 Efforts to uncover the root cause or source of the traffic tsunami have proven fruitless: even the main switchboard is going through to voicemail. Staff are not answer their email or mobile phones and the company's own separate status page has not been updated for over an hour at the time of writing. An update at 4.48pm UTC read: "This DDoS attack may also be impacting Dyn Managed DNS advanced services with possible delays in monitoring. Our Engineers are continuing to work on mitigating this issue." What's the impact? Dyn provides managed DNS services to a huge array of companies. Ironically, that means that it promises to protect companies from the very DDoS attack that is currently suffering. By paying for a company to manage your own organization's DNS, the theory is that you can save yourself a lot of time and money by not having to hire IT staff or purchase hardware to handle internet infrastructure issues like DNSSEC, IPv6, and a range of logging and reporting systems. Dyn is one of roughly 10 large companies that offers this service for anything ranging from $10 a month for a single domain to thousands of dollars a month for large internet companies. What is most remarkable about this attack however is that it is specifically targeted at the provider of those services, rather than any particular company. The US Dept of Homeland Security is "investigating all potential causes" of the @Dyn DNS outage. — The Register (@TheRegister) October 21, 2016 With no information coming out of Dyn, it is impossible to know exactly what is going on and why, but the fact that it comes just a month after an enormous DDoS on security researcher Brian Krebs' website is raising eyebrows. That also was a specific targeted attack and the reason behind it was thought to be Krebs' research on DDoS attacks. The attack was one of the largest ever seen online, and the make matters worse, the source code to create the botnet that was used in the attack was then released into the wild. It's not know if the person behind Krebs' attack is the same one that is attacking Dyn but since Dyn is a company really only known to DNS infrastructure people, it is looks likely. Experts A raft of security experts have jumped on the issue, with most warning that the DNS itself has very little to protect itself against such an attack. Richard Meeus, VP of technology at NSFOCUS, which specializes in handling DDoS attacks noted: "DNS has often been neglected in terms of its security and availability from an enterprise perspective – it is treated as if it will always be there in the same way that water comes out of the tap and electricity is there when you switch it on. "This attack highlights how critical DNS is to maintaining a stable and secure internet presence, and that the DDOS mitigation processes businesses have in place are just as relevant to their DNS service as it is to the web servers and datacentres." Lee Munson, a security researcher at Comparitech.com, noted the irony of Dyn going down: "Any company running its own website may well have its own technology in place to mitigate DDoS attacks, but it’s all for nought if the DNS provider itself is not applying a sufficient enough level of protection to its own servers and data centres." David Gibson, VP of strategy at Varonis, noted: "Like many of our aging technologies, DNS wasn’t built with security in mind… DNS is one of the aging technologies the industry is struggling to update, along with one-factor authentication and unencrypted web connections – the list is very long, and the stakes have never been higher." Craig Young, a security researcher at Tripwire, added to the general concern: "As with most software designs from the 1980s, security was generally not considered when creating DNS. Because the web is so dependent on this system, it becomes a very visible point of failure as is the case today with service provider Dyn." And Paul Calatayud, CTO of FireMon, reflected briefly on what this meant for Dyn itself: "What causes me to pause and reflect most in regards to this breaking news is that Dyn DNS is a DNS SaaS provider. Its core job is to host and manage DNS services for its clients. The impact and harm has a ripple effect attributed to the various clients Dyn services. As attackers evaluate their targets, and organisations run to the proverbial cloud for various reasons, it introduces interesting targets for the bad guys." While we don't know exactly what is going on behind the scenes, two things are for certain: first, this is a game-changer and will be reviewed and talked about for some time; and second, Dyn has suffered a huge loss in reputation; one that will only get worse the longer it stays offline. ® See our latest story Dyn DDOS explained, for latest updates Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 99 Comments More from The Register 152k cameras in 990Gbps record-breaking dual DDoS Hacked low-powered cameras and internet-of-things things 47 Comments Blizzard blighted by another DDoS storm Someone likes fragging servers 9 Comments 123-Reg drowns in ongoing DDoS tsunami Data centre target of attack of 30+ Gbps 8 Comments UK's 'FBI' hit by DDoS barrage It's just a 'temporary inconvenience', says agency 12 Comments Trick not treat: 123 Reg down on Halloween, DNS borked by DDoS In the 21st century, kids can be a real nuisance 25 Comments Google rushes in where Akamai fears to tread, shields Krebs after world's-worst DDoS 600 Gbps traffic flood overwhelmed CDN 43 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Sorry, we're having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we can Waiting for Video... Sam Shedden 19:50 Friday 21 October 2016 3 Have your say Sam Shedden whizzes through the Outer Hebrides as he endeavours to find out how many Scottish islands you can visit in one day. “That’s it, that’s the ferry, we’re going to make it!”, I yell at my travelling companion as the distinctive red funnel of a Calmac boat springs up from the horizon. It is fast approaching 14:40 and I had so far only managed to set foot on two Scottish islands during my madcap quest to visit as many as possible in a single day. We rush towards the port, leaving behind the rugged mountains of Harris. The terminal is in sight, but as I round one of the final corners several cows meander onto the road ahead. The bovine pedestrians stare at our car with vacant looks. “If we miss this ferry we’re not going to make it to all eight”, I say as I squeeze the steering wheel. The ferry departs from Ullapool and the journey begins. Picture: Stephen McIlkenny Earlier this year, ferry operators Caledonian MacBrayne announced they were adding new routes to their timetable. CalMac’s intricate network of crossings connect 22 remote islands off the west coast of Scotland. A fascination with maps that has lingered since childhood and a fervent belief that my navigational abilities surpass anything Google can offer, led me to examine the company’s various ferry routes. A colleague had recently returned from a 24 hour trip to New York and had got me thinking about just how much you can achieve in one day. So, I plotted a course on what I believed was the best way to visit as many islands as possible in one day. There was only one option, the Western Isles. Setting Sail I’d visited a handful of Scotland’s inner isles before but never ventured as far out as the 130 mile archipelago of the Outer Hebrides or Western Isles. The main route to the islands is via the ferry that links Ullapool with the town of Stornoway on Lewis. Watching the mainland diminish on a windy aft deck of a ferry is a great way to unwind. Work, bills and the general stresses of everyday life fade with the landmass you’re escaping. Not this time. Our journey began within the cosy confines of Ullapool’s Arch Inn which sits right on the waterfront and is the perfect spot to start any Hebridean adventure. We had realised the night before just how perilously tight the first leg of the trip would be. We had a two and half hour ferry to Lewis and then we would need to traverse the entirety of Lewis and Harris - the third biggest island in the British isles - to reach the port of Leverburgh on the southern tip. If our Stornoway ferry ran like clockwork we would have 90 minutes to get to the southern tip of Harris and board our second ferry. The problem was Google Maps believed it would take exactly 90 minutes to reach our destination. We couldn’t afford any delays. “It will be fine, we’ll make it,” my optimistic friend reassured me (not for the first or last time). Yeah, what does Google know anyway, I thought. As the ‘Isle of Lewis’ - the biggest ship in the Calmac fleet - rumbles out of Ullapool’s sunny harbour I begin to worry - we had been delayed by ten minutes already. 1 and 2. Lewis and Harris The largest of the Western Isles with two thirds of the group’s 27,000 population, Lewis and Harris are technically one, connected by a narrow sliver of land. However, they are considered separate by islanders, in part, due to their own distinct histories that legend says is due to a split in the Macleod Clan centuries ago. As our ferry approaches the tiny capital of Stornoway we anxiously head back to the car deck. We are lucky when exiting the ferry. Our car lane is the first to disembark and so are spared the frustrations of being stuck behind trucks and European motor homes. Stornoway’s granite streets are our first experience of the Hebrides. Brightly coloured fishing boats dot the harbour, Gaelic sign posts greet us and chattering school kids pass us by as we make our way south. Mercifully the roads are clear once we get out of the town and soon empty moorlands of orange and brown surround us, lonely bothies the only signs of civilization in this far-flung corner of Britain. The final check-in time for our ferry from Leverburgh to the isle of Berneray comes and goes, I collected all our tickets in Ullapool so I’m hoping that we can drive straight onto the boat provided we get there before the departure time. It’s a close run affair and not one I would recommend, but somehow we make it with four minutes to spare. Elated we park the car and swagger onto the ferry’s passenger deck, jubilant in our triumph over Google Maps. 3-7. Berneray, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist and Eriskay After conquering the most challenging segment of the trip we have time to enjoy our surroundings are able to take a more leisurely pace through the next five islands. We have three hours to pass through the middle section of the Hebrides. The ferry drops us on one of the smallest of the Western Isle’s fifteen inhabited islands, Berneray, which is ringed by sand dunes and pristine white beaches. Crossing a stone causeway we arrive in North Uist and take time to stop off in the village of Lochmaddy - which has a ferry link to the isle of Skye - where we are greeted by the bleats of hundreds of sheep penned in for a livestock auction and the rhythmic chanting of the auctioneer. Scattered across North Uist and South Uist lonely ruins and weathered standing stones can be seen entrenched in boggy fields, hinting at the thousands of years these islands have been populated. Much of North and South Uist is pitted with water, thousands of small lochs create a flooded landscape that enhance our sense of isolation. Sandwiched between the two Uists is Benbecula, where we stop at a Great War monument (one of many) that remembers the sacrifices thousands of islanders made for the war effort. As the sun disappears behind grey clouds and dusk approaches we arrive at island number seven, Eriskay, to catch our final ferry. 8. Barra The screeching of my car alarm draws disgruntled looks from my fellow passengers - most of whom are trying to sleep in their cars - as the choppy crossing from Eriskay bounces our little ferry up and down. By the time we disembark it is pitch black and we scuttle around the island’s west coast until we come to our resting place for the night, the Croit na h-Aibhne B&B where the owner Mary Ann gives us a warm welcome. Starting at 10:30 our journey has encompassed, eight islands, 200 miles and three ferries. We had crammed the entire Outer Hebrides into one day but they deserve a lot longer. The varied landscapes and rich histories of each isle mean there are many reasons to come back and explore in detail. “Will you be doing any more islands?” Mary Ann asks. No, I reply assuming she means in the following days. It is not until the ferry back to the mainland the next morning we discover that Barra is connected to the isle of Vatersay at its southern edge via a bridge. We could have made it to nine! Next time, perhaps.

Google has repackaged its offerings into Regional and Multi-Regional tiers, as well as the new Coldline cold storage offering to complement its existing Nearline tier. In addition to the new classes, Google is undercutting Amazon Web Services (AWS) on storage pricing and adding automation for moving objects between tiers. Last year, Google rolled out its first foray into cooler storage with Nearline. The service was seen as Google's closest competitor to Amazon Glacier, but with significant differences: Nearline costs more per gigabyte, for example, but it comes with a cheaper retrieval fee and is intended for data that is accessed more frequently. Cold storage in the public cloud can be good for archival storage that is rarely accessed, but the downside to these services is the high cost of pulling data out. Google has priced Coldline storage at the same rate Amazon charges for its comparable Glacier service -- $0.007 per gigabyte, per month. The two providers charge differently for access to the data, however, with Google charging $0.05 per gigabyte for retrievals, compared with $0.05 per 1,000 retrieval or upload requests on Glacier. Video sharing and streaming service Vimeo Inc. uses Multi-Regional, as well as Nearline, and it works with Fastly, a real-time content delivery network service and Google cloud partner, to provide sub-150 millisecond response times for customers. Vimeo used Glacier, but moved to Nearline because of the time it took to get data out of the AWS offering. It's now exploring Coldline to fill that same role in some cases. "We want to be cost-effective as long as we're not compromising performance," said Narendra Venkataraman, senior director of engineering at Vimeo, based in New York. Coldline provides millisecond access to storage intended for long-term archiving accessed less than once a year for uses such as big data or multimedia content. Glacier, meanwhile, can take several hours to retrieve data. Vimeo was an early adopter of AWS and still uses the platform, as well as its own data centers, but it's found some advantages to using Google Cloud Platform. The high number of end points across the globe addresses latency and provides faster mobile uploads for users, and the platform enables users to resume a file upload anytime, rather than having to do it all in one chunk like they do on AWS, Venkataraman said. New Google Cloud Storage tiers cheaper than AWS The Multi-Regional tier is targeted at workloads that require high availability and geo-redundancy. It's priced at $0.026 per gigabyte, per month, including any and all replication and rerouting across the network. That service is currently limited to the U.S., EU and Asia regions, and any existing standard storage buckets in multiregional locations have been automatically converted to the new storage class. Google Cloud Storage Regional provides redundancy within a region and is intended for workloads that need to pair storage and compute for analytics, machine learning and other similar services. At $0.02 per gigabyte, per month, the new tier effectively represents a 23% drop in pricing from the current offering. It also comes in under what Amazon charges for its standard storage, which ranges between $0.0275 and $0.03 per gigabyte, per month. Trying to be the lowest cost for storage is one of the on-ramps to the cloud ... once you do that, you make it more frictionless to get the adjacent services. Jeff Katosenior analyst and consultant, Taneja Group The regional tier will be available Nov. 1, along with new API operations pricing for both Multi-Regional and Regional that cuts prices by up to 60% off the current rate, depending on the operations class customers select. Price cuts around storage are all about getting as much customer data on a platform as possible in order to sell higher-level services, said Jeff Kato, senior analyst and consultant at the Taneja Group Inc., in Hopkinton, Mass. Providers know customers will want to do more than just store the data, and the high cost to transfer data out of a public cloud often makes it easier to do things like analytics on the platform. "Trying to be the lowest cost for storage is one of the on-ramps to the cloud," Kato said. "The key is to get it there, and once you do that, you make it more frictionless to get the adjacent services." Lifecycle management now in beta Google also added a series of partners to its storage network, as well as a lifecycle management capability currently in beta. The new feature allows users to set policies that automatically move objects to colder tiers based on their age. Multi-Regional is an important tier for customers doing continuous integration and delivery that make configuration changes in real time, while the lifecycle management could be a compelling addition to the platform, said Lee Chen, head of strategic partnerships at Fastly, based in San Francisco. Fastly, which partners with all the major public cloud providers, connects to Google's cloud to provide edge connections and real-time performance analytics. Chen cited the example of customer-facing resources that can go months without getting touched, but can see massive, unexpected spikes in traffic. Being able to easily move data between the tiers could enable Google Cloud customers to improve the economics of cloud storage even further, he said.

UNCENSORED Robots Are Now Working in Translation Services and Retail This week, Inc. editors and writers talk about the rise of robots in translation services and retail stores. Ean Seeb, marijuana entrepreneur, discusses how he sold his dispensary and licenses to grow in Colorado to Willie Nelson. By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT Pepper will be sold to retailers and researchers in the U.S. for the first time this year. CREDIT: Will Yakowicz Advertisement Welcome to the 87th episode of the Inc. Uncensored podcast! This week's episode is hosted by Inc. editor Jim Ledbetter. Reporter Zoe Henry talks about the advances in artificial intelligence-powered language and translation services like Siri and Google Translate. Google's new translation technology, called the Google Neural Machine Translation System, is now looking at entire sentences instead of prior methods that translated each word individually. Henry argues that Google's claims that the robot translators have human-level accuracy is flawed and that human translators should not be forgotten. According to this year's Inc. 5000 list, translation service is one of the fastest-growing industries this year, and there is a lot at stake if robots are trusted completely. Subscribe at the iTunes store Staff writer Will Yakowicz talks about his experience meeting SoftBank's robot Pepper. The robot, which can hold simple two-way conversations and is said to be able to recognize human emotions, will be sold to retailers to engage customers. While the robot is not perfect, it can be connected to cloud-based AI platforms like IBM's Watson. The group talks about how robots are being created to do certain tasks but the future of more advanced robots is coming. Lastly, the podcast crew interviews entrepreneur Ean Seeb, who co-founded one of the first and longest-running dispensaries in Denver, Colorado. Seeb and his co-founders recently sold their business and licenses to grow marijuana legally to Willie Nelson (who launched his marijuana brand Willie Reserve). Seeb talks about what it was like to build a multimillion-dollar business--and then say goodbye to his baby. You can listen to individual episodes of the Inc. Uncensored podcast, which is part of the Panoply network, or on iTunes--where you can also subscribe. We hope you enjoy. Stream the 87th episode above. Published on: Oct 21, 2016 Advertisement

TECHNOLOGY 8 Awesome Hacks and Tips for the Google Pixel Smartphone The Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones are super-smart. Here are a few hacks to get more out of them. By John Brandon John Brandon is a contributing editor at Inc. magazine covering technology. He writes the Tech Report column for Inc.com. @jmbrandonbb Contributing editor, Inc.com@jmbrandonbb WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It's brand spanking new. The shrinkwrap is freshly crinkled, there's a faint smell of packing peanuts in the air. That's right, you're the proud owner of the Google Pixel or what many pundits are calling the best smartphone ever, or least the best challenger to the throne occupied by the iPhone. The good news? Your smartphone is probably smarter than you realize. These tips and tricks will help you do amazing things, impress everyone in the office, and even take a selfie by using your voice. Try doing that in your local Apple store and see what everyone says. 1. Take a selfie by voice That's right, your phone is a selfie master. When you say "OK, Google" you can ask the Assistant, which is like Siri but understands the context of your conversations, to snap a photo. When you do, there's a quick countdown and then a snap. Bonus if you use it for fake spy photos. 2. Ask the Assistant to recite a poem Try it now--it's awesome. The Assistant can recite a sonnet by Shakespeare or something by Emily Dickinson. It's proof that robots can read us books and poems to ease our stress. Make sure you say the exact phrase "recite a poem" or it won't work. 3. Set your phone to record 4K video The Pixel ships with HD video recording enabled, which is a bit puzzling until you realize how big these recorded files can be. You can record in 4K, though, just like the iPhone 7. And, the Pixel XL even has a 2560 x 1440 resolution screen for watching the results. Just start the camera, click the settings on the upper left, then Settings and look for video resolution. 4. Double-tap the power button to access the camera If you need to take a quick photo, double-tap the power button. It brings up the camera faster than I would expect so you can make sure Bigfoot doesn't slip back into the woods. 5. Long press on app icons Be sure to try holding down your finger on app icons. For example, if you hold press on the Messenger app for texting, you can quickly start a new conversation. I'm expecting more app developers to take advantage of this quick access feature. 6. Take advantage of quick charge If you're an iPhone user, you might not be used to this. With the PIxel, you can charge up the phone quite a bit--e.g., seven hours of usage in 15 minutes. It changes some of the dynamics. You can let the phone run all day without worrying too much and "reup" quickly. 7. Ask the Assistant to make the sound of a helicopter One of my favorites is asking the Assistant this exact question: "What sound does a helicopter make?" Make sure you use that phrase, because the bot will then play the sound of a helicopter. Why is that cool? Because bots will one day play clips from movies, pronounce words, and teach us how to sing. They will become more and more like a trusted friend. 8. Order a custom case You might not know this, but the Pixel lets you add custom designed cases. Just go to Google.com/livecase and upload your photo, pick a Google Maps locale, or pick a design. Cases also have a programmable shortcut button for a favorite app. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Oct 21, 2016 Advertisement

Follow TechnoBuffalo This week, Google rolled out the first developer preview for Android 7.1, introducing features such as app shortcuts and image keyboard support. Unfortunately, the preview doesn’t include Google’s Night Light feature, which warms your screen so it’s not quite so hard on your eyes. There’s more. According to Ian Lake, an Android developer advocate, Night Light and fingerprint reader gestures won’t be coming to existing Nexus phones at all. If you want the best Android experience, you’ll have to pick up a Pixel. These features aren’t the only ones to be kept from Nexus owners. Google Assistant is also exclusive to the Pixel, although there are ways to get it up and running on devices running Android Nougat. Android Police points out the features aren’t coming to Nexus phones due to hardware limitations. If you want the best Android experience, you’ll have to pick up a Pixel. Night Light is particularly useful because studies show blue light emitted from mobile displays can negatively affect how well you sleep. Apple introduced a similar feature in iOS 10 called Night Shift. Nexus owners are still getting some pretty cool features in Android 7.1, but it still sucks hearing about features that won’t make it to older devices.

Published on October 21, 2016. AwesomenessTV, one of the companies cited in a complaint by advocacy groups over influencer marketing directed toward children. Credit: AwesomenessTV/Dreamworks Most Popular A group of industry watchdogs are calling for Google, DreamWorks' Awesomeness TV, Walt Disney's Maker Studios and two other companies to stop influencer marketing that targets children. The Center for Digital Democracy, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and Public Citizen on Friday filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to investigate and take action against the companies for what they called "unfair and deceptive practice of targeting influencer marketing toward children." They also urged the FTC to issue policy guidelines that would prohibit companies from using influencers to target children. It has become increasingly common for marketers to create content featuring popular personalities on YouTube, which is part of Google, and other online celebrities to promote their brands and products on social platforms. In a press release, the advocacy groups argued that these "'influencer' ads take unfair advantage of kids, who do not have the ability to recognize that companies use social media and YouTube celebrities to pitch toys, junk food and other products." The advocacy groups pointed to videos of child stars unboxing toys, playing games and sampling junk food that appear on YouTube channels. Representatives of Google, Awesomeness TV, Maker Studios and the FTC did not respond to requests for comment. (Update: A Google spokeswoman said in an email that YouTube wants content creators to be up front with viewers if their videos include any kind of paid promotion. "As our long-standing policy makes clear, anyone uploading videos to YouTube has a legal obligation to disclose to YouTube and their viewers if a video contains paid promotion," she said. "Any videos that have disclosed paid product placement or endorsements are restricted from the YouTube Kids app.") The Institute for Public Representation at Georgetown University Law Center is representing the groups making the complaint. "Child-directed influencer marketing is misleading to children because their developing brains do not process or understand advertisements the way adults do -- especially advertisements disguised as content," said Laura Moy, director at the institute, in the press release. FTC regulations require influencer marketing to be identified as advertising. But the groups argued Friday that disclosure is not enough because it "would not negate the inherent deceptiveness of child-directed influencer marketing." The Center for Digital Democracy and Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood have previously filed complaints with the FTC concerning child-directed marketing practices on YouTube and its Kids hub, specifically for mixing ads and content. The FTC did not take any action. Last year YouTube added parental controls to its Kids app to allow parents to restrict their kids' searches. The FTC has been cracking down on influencer marketing. The agency has said celebrities who are getting paid to promote a product need to indicate such in their social posts. From the marketers' perspective, however, hashtags like "#ad" or "#sp" for "sponsored" make the posts seem less authentic and natural. Warner Bros. settled charges with the FTC this summer over its marketing for the video game "Middle Earth: Shadow Mordor." The FTC charged that Warner Bros did not ensure that influencers disclosed that they had been paid to promote the video game. And earlier this year Lord & Taylor settled charges over a social campaign where it paid influencers to post photos of themselves wearing a dress but influencers did not disclose the sponsorship.

Launched on October 4, both new Google-designed smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, are exclusive to Verizon in the U.S. Contract-free Pixels are available via Google’s online store and from Best Buy. Before we get to the teardown, YouTuber JerryRigEverything yesterday conducted a durability test of his Pixel XL, confirming that the speaker slit is made of cloth. “This is the first thing that surprised me,” said the YouTuber. “The earpiece made is made of cloth unlike the plastic and metal speaker grilles on other phones.” It will be interesting seeing how the use of cloth affects audio quality over time, but cleaning the earpiece won’t be a trivial affair due to possible puncturing. Pixel XL has these key features: 5.5-inch 534ppi AMOLED display with 1,440 x 2,560 resolution Curved 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor with a pair of 2.15 GHz high-performance CPU cores and two power-efficient 1.6 GHz cores 4GB LPDDR4 RAM 12.3-megapixel f/2.0 back camera with phase detection autofocus, laser detection autofocus, no unsightly bump and no optical image stabiliziation 8-megapixel front camera 32 GB or 128 GB built-in storage Pixel Imprint back-mounted fingerprint sensor USB Type-C port and 3.5 mm headphone port No Home button (onscreen button instead) Android 7.1 Nougat Now on to iFixit’s teardown analysis. The Pixel XL uses standard T5 Torx screens, unlike Apple’s special Pentalobe screws in the iPhone. The vivid Samsung-made AMOLED panel separates from the digitizer glass easily. The display assembly not so much due to thin components and no frame or bezel behind the display. The touch controller is a Synaptics ClearPad S3708 module. iFixit notes that Google has a different take on the “pull to remove” battery tab in the form of a perforated portion of the sleeve that, when peeled away (without heat), “becomes an impressive pull tab.” The HTC-made 13.28 Wh battery beats out the iPhone 7 Plus’s 11.1 Wh battery, but falls behind the 13.86 Wh one in the Galaxy S7 Edge (the Note 7 packed a 13.48 Wh battery). iFixit praises Google’s use of modular components that can be easily replaced, like the 3.5mm headphone jack, the front-facing camera and an interconnect board with a status LED, an ambient light sensor and a microphone. iFixit wrote: These smaller bits aren’t always so modular. In other phones, we often find them clustered together on the main board. More modularity means cheaper and easier repairs—if a single component fails, you don’t have to replace the entire motherboard or embark on a risky microsoldering adventure. Other components iFixit was able to identify include an NXP-made NFC controller, Samsung-made NAND flash chips and Qualcomm-made audio codec, dynamic antenna matching tuner, LTE RF transceiver, power management circuitry and fast-charging Quick Charge 3.0 platform. The USB Type-C port is a bare-bones part, meaning cheap USB port replacements. Component design and layout point to the Pixel being the first truly Google-made smartphones in a way that the Nexus family was not. “With nearly everything out of the case, we’ve seen almost zero evidence of this phone’s HTC manufacturing origin” aside from the HTC mark on the battery, notes iFixit. As mentioned, most parts can be easily replaced once the display assembly is removed because most parts are modular, the battery has a removal tab and is adhered by a modest amount of adhesive and the screws are standard T5 Torx ones. In conclusion, iFixit gave the Pixel XL a repairability score of six out of ten, the best repairability score of any HTC-manufactured device.

Source: iFixIt Y’all guys just changed iFixit to iFixIt everywhere in this article… Christian Zibreg Me too 😀 Thanks for the heads-up! Agneev Mukherjee You’re welcome 😀 leart I’m wondering how much Google payed to get reviews for this device, i mean not in this site but around the internet lol Matt Just as much as every other company smh… leart i dont think so.. really, google has no appeal at all Dave Kurt A lot… YouTube, for instance, it’s riddled with corruption. These influential internet personalities have, for a long time, been advocates of the Android operating system… Bashing the iPhone for the ‘lack’ of features; water resistance, expendable storage, wireless charging, et cetera. So I ask, how can these people who have bashed the iPhone for the lack of these features, in the same damn breath, praise the Google pixel?! Like, of course, now it doesn’t matter… Of course, now it’s simplicity that matters. 😀 Get real! What made the iPhone sh*t is what makes the Pixel good? Great logic. leart here’s a epic picture, lol 4 devicee on its first iOS release .. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f971808a72e0d1e9964494032475db600b6117c9e559c0d63ce27730ff7aec88.jpg PhoneTechJay Eww it’s just another HTC no thank you. askep3 If the iPhone 7 had an 8 megapixel front facing camera they could’ve advertised it as just as good as the 6’s actual camera (if it performed just as well of course) 5723alex . It is almost impossible to teardown the Pixel without breaking the screen. Matt Foot Overpriced, over-hyped junk. I can buy 3-6 pristine Lenovo ThinkPad laptops for the same price, get WAY more productivity out of them, and they’ll outlast this junk by 10-15 years! Legend Thinkpads are crap laptops.. you’d be lucky if you got a year out of them… Lets not kid ourselves. Matt Foot Sure, they *really* must be awful if they are the ONLY laptops that have, and are certified by NASA for use on space missions for many years. Yep, only a year of use can be had from them… that’s why I am typing this on a Lenovo ThinkPad R61, released in 2007 and STILL working flawlessly. Yep, that seems to give credence to your statement, eh? My Uncle has a *sixteen* year old ThinkPad T21 (okay, very slow) STILL working perfectly and in long time use since day one. Yep, continuing this trend of being “crap laptops” is the 760E, released in the mid 1990s, STILL WORKING PERFECTLY as seen in my video, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63iPYjW0Ms And finally we have a brand new, consumer grade smartphone, so new and shiny as to be an unknown quantity, but what IS known is that the likelihood of it still being in undamaged, full working order and serviceable in 21 years time, is ZERO. Maybe SOME of the more recent, consumer grade Lenovo notebooks are rubbish, yes, but not ALL. So… tell me again about how “crap” ThinkPads are? Legend BRUV buy a REAL laptop …. like a Macbook pro…. CLOWN. Can’t afford it? Can only afford $100? that’s your fault BUM Matt Foot I am not your “bruv”, sonny Jim. Being able to afford something or not is irrelevant – if I wanted ten MacBook Pro laptops I’d buy them TOMORROW. Don’t confuse wealth with intelligence, you’re a shining example of that fallacy falling flat on its face. Any fool can be rich, but only the biggest fool makes assumptions regarding the things they think other “ought to buy”. Cheerio. Legend BRUV… you have a THINKPAD!!!! You’re broke. I’M DONE LMFAOOOOO Matt Foot Making the common mistake of assuming wealth increases intelligence… gosh, you’re really up the creek if you think so. You’re a shining example of someone as shallow and superficial as to not notice your own deficiencies and the foolishness of your erroneous assumptions. Duh.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Google dropped its ban on personally identifiable web tracking In News by Jamie Peck / October 21, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @jamie_elizabeth Good news for people who hate online privacy: Google quietly lifted its ban on personally identifiable web tracking. When Google first began tracking users’ web history as a way to target ads via the DoubleClick network back in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin insisted his company would never tie the data gathered to any personally identifiable information. Experts say it hasn’t, and I believe them, because fuck if I know how to tell if they’re doing that. But over the summer, Google began tying users’ personal information with data gleaned from their online activity — including, oh no, what they write in their Gmail accounts — for the first time, asking existing users to opt into a new version of the company’s privacy agreement. (New Google users are opted into the new policy by default.) The language is as follows: If that sounds like all the super personal shit you say in Gchat, the porn you jerk off to, and the serial killer documentaries you watch out of purely academic interest will now be stored in a database tied to your name and info, that’s because they will be! From ProPublica: The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on the keywords they used in their Gmail. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. … “The fact that DoubleClick data wasn’t being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand,” said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.“It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy,” he said. “That wall has just fallen.” In a statement to ProPublica, Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville contended that the increased surveillance will only be used to target ads better on your various devices, and anyway, it’s easy to opt out: Our advertising system was designed before the smartphone revolution. It offered user controls and determined ads’ relevance, but only on a per-device basis. This past June we updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices. Before we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency. As a result, it is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged. Equally important: we provided prominent user notifications about this change in easy-to understand language as well as simple tools that let users control or delete their data. Users can access all of their account controls by visiting My Account and we’re pleased that more than a billion have done so in its first year alone. Right, because people always pay such close attention to what they’re agreeing to when a little box pops up and interrupts their cat video binge. Even if you have faith that they’re only using this information to annoy you with the same ads across multiple devices, do you really trust Google to keep a lid on it? The company has already handed over quite a lot of goodies to the government, not to mention the havoc that could be wreaked by hackers. Can you even imagine the national gridlock that would ensue if Vladimir Putin posted everyone’s bitchiest Gchats? America would simply die. Luckily, concerned parties can opt out — for now — using these instructions from ProPublica: To opt-out of Google’s identified tracking, visit the Activity controls on Google’s My Account page, and uncheck the box next to “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services.” You can also delete past activity from your account.   Just because it’s an uphill battle doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to resist molestation by Google’s grabby, ever-encroaching tentacles.

INTU, -1.23% today announced the start of a collaboration with Google to boost productivity for small businesses around the world. The companies are working together on product integrations for small businesses using G Suite, formerly called Google Apps for Work, and QuickBooks Online. The companies kicked off the collaboration by introducing two new releases: Google Calendar and QuickBooks Online – This new integration allows business owners to schedule client work and appointments with Google Calendar, and these billable appointments are available in QuickBooks for invoicing customers and managing finances. Prior to this integration, small businesses had to manually enter each activity from their Google calendar into QuickBooks, which took longer and increased the chance of human error. Single Sign On (SSO) available through G Suite Marketplace – Small business owners can now sign up for QuickBooks Online through the G Suite Marketplace. This includes the introduction of single sign on capabilities, allowing customers to sign in and manage their QuickBooks information from their Google account. Furthermore, signing up for QuickBooks Online is simplified as a business owner’s information is pre-populated from their Google account. “This is the beginning of an exciting collaboration between Intuit and Google that will deliver huge benefits for the millions of small businesses that we serve around the world,” said Vinay Pai, vice president and head of the Intuit Developer Group. “Our data indicates that 56 percent of QuickBooks customers are using Google Calendar to book appointments, schedule meetings and track client work. By bringing our technologies together, we will create important efficiencies between two solutions customers are already using.” The Value of Integrations for Small Businesses Intuit’s 2016 Appification of Small Business Study found that 58 percent of global small businesses look for seamless integrations when selecting an app to help run their businesses. Savvy business owners understand that deep technology integrations not only help to save time, but also eliminate errors and improves overall business productivity because employees can focus on driving revenue and growing the business. Intuit will be demoing the new calendaring integration with G Suite at the QuickBooks Annual Conference in San Jose next week (October 24-26, 2016).

SUBSCRIBE Is your location data being held hostage? Columnist Adam Dorfman makes the case for using the power of data amplifiers to ensure your business location data is correct and consistent across the web. Adam Dorfman on October 21, 2016 at 12:00 pm More Paying to have your location data directly managed on tier-two directories is like buying Twitter followers: you might think you’re buying more visibility, but ultimately you’ll waste your money and effort. The recent experience of a healthcare provider illustrates this point vividly. Not all directories deserve your attention A directory becomes “tier-two” when it lacks visibility in search engine results pages. Tier-two directories might have once been favored by Google’s search algorithm for local queries but aren’t anymore. They remain part of the local search conversation primarily because of their past reputations, not their current performance — which can make it more difficult for businesses to make informed choices about where to invest their location marketing spend. For example, a healthcare provider (a client of ours) contacted us after a location marketing vendor tried to convince one of the doctors in their network to pay for a listing on one such tier-two directory, Insider Pages. The vendor noted that the client was not listed on Insider Pages and suggested that the client could make the problem go away by paying a monthly premium to the vendor, which, in turn, would update the client’s physician data on Insider Pages. This approach is fraught with a number of problems. First of all, Insider Pages operates as a closed-loop advertising network through an exclusive relationship with the vendor that had contacted our client. Essentially, the vendor was relying on a racket: you have a problem with a site that is a partner of ours. Pay us, and we’ll make the problem disappear. How convenient! Had our client fallen for this scare tactic, they would have discovered that for a healthcare provider, Insider Pages is a marginal site and is not a relevant source for consumers looking for physicians. To-wit: According to SimilarWeb, Insider Pages is a website that received 203,000 unique visits in total last month for more than 1,000 categories of businesses (healthcare categories accounts for 82 of those). Whitespark has them ranked Number 27 as a general citation source, just behind Brownbook and Cyclex USA, and Insider Pages isn’t even on the list of important citation sources for doctors. By comparison, Healthgrades received 20,900,000 visits last month, and all of their traffic was healthcare-related. Unsurprisingly, they are ranked Number One on Whitespark’s list of important citations for doctors. It’s no wonder that in 2016, our healthcare clients received on average only one website referral from Insider Pages for every 600,000 visitors to their physician and location directories. Today’s mobile, omnichannel world requires a different approach — one that treats location data as an owned asset to create long-term business impact. Rather than waste money by following a paid inclusion model that focuses on tier-two directories, brands must now build location data assets that are usable across the search ecosystem as it exists today and as it will exist in the future. Doing so also means sharing that data with high-impact data amplifiers — or the most influential publishers and aggregators of location data — augmented by relationships with a few carefully curated niche vertical market publishers. The advantages of data amplifiers As my colleague Gib Olander has defined, data amplifiers consist of publishers (such as Apple and Google) and data aggregators (such as Infogroup), which together make sure an enterprise’s location data is made available to all the places where people conduct near me searches. Data amplifiers have become more important because near me searches have not only exploded in growth by number, but also in places that they occur. Someone looking for a doctor or a restaurant might rely on a Google app, Yelp, Foursquare, or Apple Spotlight Search, as well as well known vertical sites such as Healthgrades or TripAdvisor. Data amplifiers ensure that a brand’s location data is visible on all the places where moments of discovery happen. A location data management strategy that focuses on distributing location data assets via data amplifiers works. According to SIM Partners proprietary research, enterprises that improved the accuracy and reach of their location data by just 20 percent saw traffic to their location pages increase up to 450 percent and on-page action conversion rates increase by 216 percent. Auditing a client’s data To illustrate the point to our client, we conducted an audit for a few of the physicians that the vendor insisted needed to appear on Insider Pages. When we conducted searches for the physicians on Google, they appeared on high-value listings across the board. But the Insider Pages listing did not even appear on the first 10 pages of results. Moreover, the doctors ranked in the Google Snack Pack for a number of highly competitive non-branded queries related to the physician’s areas of specialty. This result is not surprising. A BrightLocal survey has shown that local SEOs suspect that the quantity of citations matters less these days, while the quality of citations matters more — not at all unlike the way link signals have evolved over the years in Google’s core ranking algorithm. In addition, citation-related metrics in Moz’s Local Search Ranking Factors survey have dropped in importance every year since 2013. Finally, LocalSEOGuide’s recent Local SEO Ranking Factors study has shown that citations can play a role in getting a business into a snack pack but have little importance in how well a business ranks once it is there. Citations are still important. Businesses should consider them to be table stakes for building visibility. But publishing perfectly accurate citations on marginal sites becomes less influential on how well your brand ranks. Rather than overpay to correct a listing that has nearly negligible value to our client’s business, we recommended that our client distribute their data to Infogroup, which, in turn, feeds data to Insider Pages (as well as a number of more relevant directories). As noted, this approach makes the most sense, as Insider Pages gets very little traffic and has almost no impact on our client’s Google performance. It’s also a shame that Insider Pages hasn’t updated their FAQ page to reflect the new reality of how business listings are managed on their site. The directory still states that businesses can claim and manage their listings for free by logging in — which has not been possible for some time. This inaccurate information causes additional confusion when local businesses receive email solicitations that their location data needs to be corrected on Insider Pages. When businesses check Insider Pages to review their faulty location data, the site suggests that their local search vendor should be able to resolve the problem immediately, which is just not true. Unleash your location data If your brand operates multiple locations, I urge you to: form relationships with data amplifiers to unleash your data as a valuable asset. Or work with a location marketing platform provider that can manage the relationships for you. beware of firms that try to entice you with the promise of increased visibility through a paid inclusion model — especially one that involves a closed-loop advertising platform. apply a critical eye when you evaluate individual citations. Ask yourself how likely it is that customers of your business will see this citation source. If you were a Google engineer, how important would you view this citation source when building ranking algorithms? Also, look at your Web analytics to see how frequently these citation sources are sending traffic to your site. Don’t let your listings be held hostage. Unleash your data through amplifiers.

By Nick Heath | October 21, 2016, 9:40 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: LawrenLu/Getty Images/iStockphoto Like moving house, packing up your data and shifting it from one cloud to another can be a stressful experience. But not as fraught as you might think, says Jyrki Pulliainen, who as a software engineer at music streaming service Spotify has just overseen the move of about 1.5 billion files from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud Storage. While Spotify stumbled over a few gotchas when shifting the 3PB of data, the process was completed in the past couple of weeks and without major setbacks. Here's what Spotify learned from moving from AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) to Google Cloud Storage, as part of its wider migration to Google Cloud Platform. 1. Check if your infrastructure is tightly coupled to your old cloud Spotify baked the names of the AWS S3 storage buckets into the names of the keys for its data caches, in order to help with A/B testing. "It turns out this is a bad idea when you migrate the bucket," said Pulliainen, who added that Spotify had to pause the migration while it updated its cache keys. 2. Watch out for unexpected latency spikes As part of the move, Spotify shifted data from an AWS datacenter in Ireland to a facility in Google's US Central region, due to most of Spotify's customers now residing in North America. Following the switch, Spotify was surprised to see higher than expected latency when serving data to some US customers. "The lesson learned here is that our private capacity points had IP addresses registered to Stockholm, so we were ping-ponging to Europe and ping-ponging back to US Central to fetch the files," he said, speaking at the Google Cloud Platform Next conference in London. "So if you do these kind of moves, remember to check where your IP addresses are registered and change them accordingly." 3. Check how well your new cloud provider integrates with your CDN Spotify uses three major content delivery network (CDN) providers, Fastly, Akamai and Verizon, to cache music locally for users across the globe. Data Center Must-Reads Photos: A look inside Google's, Microsoft's and Facebook's datacenters Gartner's 10 big trends that will change how IT operates 10 DevOps experts to follow on Twitter Ebook: IT leader’s guide to making DevOps work While Spotify's CDN partners offer Google Cloud Storage (GCS) support 'out of the box', there were some roadblocks. A negative for Spotify is that its CDN providers "don't really support" OAuth, the token-based authentication system that allows third-party services to access online accounts without knowing the user's password. "We would have liked to have had OAuth support. We had to create artificial Google accounts for our CDN providers. It's a hassle for us, for our IT department, for our security and we get less fine-grained access control." 4. Check what you'll lose during the move Each cloud provider has strengths and weaknesses, so you should expect some gaps. Check which features from your existing cloud provider are missing or inferior to your previous choice. "Now that we've done the move, we are generally really happy but we have some wishes for the future. "We would love to see cross-continental replication, like the fact we now run in a US Central regional bucket, that causes a slight latency for our European users. "We ideally would like to have another bucket in Asia. At the moment, the GCS does not allow cross-continental replication. "We're also seeing slightly lower cold read latencies than with S3, the good news is that Google has improvements upcoming and we've worked with them to shear off 30ms. Pulliainen added that these latencies should be invisible to users, due to Spotify's technical architecture. Aspects of his specific complaints may have been addressed by Google with the introduction of the new Coldline and Multi-regional storage tiers this week, but his point of looking for gaps still stands. 5. Check how simple the transfer process will be One of the most obvious things for firms to check up front are which tools are available to copy data between their old and new cloud provider, and how good these tools are. Spotify moved some 1.5bn files — covering music, cover images and metadata — totalling about 3PB of data between S3 and Google Cloud Storage. While moving this much data understandably took a couple of weeks, the actual process was straightforward, said Pulliainen, who described moving the 1.5bn files as nothing more than a matter of "clicking around a UI for a moment" and called the overall experience "super simple". Out of the 1.5bn files, 144 had transfer failures, but Pulliainen said it took Google less than one day to track down those that were missing.

The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores.

The search giant once vowed to make privacy a priority, keeping identifiable information gathered from Gmail separate from the web-browsing data used by advertisers. But as of June 28, that distinction is no longer in place by default. According to the update, user activity “on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.” This change was widely glossed over when it first was made, but ProPublica recently took a closer look. If you were an existing user at the time of the move, you would have received an opt-in request titled something along the lines of “Some new features for your Google account.” Anyone who has signed up for an account since then would have been opted in by default. In the past, the customized DoubleClick ads that popped up around the web were only based on users' Google searches—but now they can reference keywords mined from Gmail as well. It’s easy to see how this might raise privacy concerns for some users, especially those who weren’t aware of the switch. To see if you’re affected, go to the Activity Controls section on Google’s My Account page. If the box that reads “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services” is unchecked, you’re in the clear. Unfortunately, Google is just one of the sites doing questionable things with your personal information. To see how much Facebook knows about you, you can download this Chrome plug-in.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets ANALYSIS Internet giants turning one-stop platforms to beat app economy Priyanka Pani   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Shutterstock.com One-stop shop For service providers, being listed on Google or Facebook could lead to more business Facebook, Google look to consolidate multiple services on a single platform Mumbai, October 21:   Internet giants Facebook and Google are moving beyond their existing offerings and platforms to venture into aggregating online services. Instead of using multiple applications for various needs, Facebook and Google are looking to layer these services to a single platform. From ordering food, to hailing a cab and booking car-cleaning services, you won’t have to download a bunch of applications. Soon, you will be able to do all of this on Facebook or Google. To start with, Google has launched a facility to book Ola and Uber cabs on its Map and via its search page. Other services are probably on the anvil. Facebook, on the other hand, has partnered with a number of online players in the US to offer a one-stop shop for services. It’s only a matter of time before Facebook starts rolling this out in other countries, too, including India. Staying relevant According to analysts, the move is an attempt by the internet giants to stay relevant at a time when online usage is shifting to niche applications. “Consumers now search for food, hotels and movie tickets in specific applications instead of on Google. By being an aggregator of services, Google is trying to evolve with the changing times,” said an analyst tracking the sector. Jayanth Kolla, founder of IT and digital research firm Convergence Catalyst, said: “They want users to make its mobile browser more engaging so that people use at least one of their properties at a given time.” For the service providers, being listed on Google or Facebook could lead to more business. According to an industry report, about 65 per cent of app downloads or installs are a result of internet search. Sanchit Gogia, founder of research firm Greyhound Group, said the aggregator model will work in a market like India, where a large number of users can’t download multiple applications due to poor data coverage and/or lack of smartphone penetration. Abinash Tripathy, founder of CRM (Customer Relationship Management)-software start-up Helpshift, said these initiatives by Google are “reactive strategies as they fear that the app economy will kill the web franchise one day; hence, they are trying to make people stay in the browser through all means.” (This article was published on October 21, 2016) Related NEWS Flipkart follows Google, Amazon into the world of secret servers Facebook, Twitter weigh bids for media rights to IPL TOPICS internet | social networking | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

While it's still committed to delivering updates to the previous pure Android devices, and while Android Nougat will have many similar features on the Pixel, there are a few differences. The Google Pixel launched with Android 7.1, the first smartphone to do so, bringing with it a whole range of new features that build on the top of the existing goodness that Google introduced with Android Nougat a few months earlier. Here are all the details you need to get to grips with Google's new phone, as we dig deep into those Pixel features and Android 7.1. Google Pixel general tips and tricks Android has long been known for its customisation capabilities, but with Nougat 7.1 on the Pixel, the options are even greater. You can change the way a number of features appear and how the system works. App action shortcuts: A lot like iOS with its Force Touch quick actions, many Android 7.1 stock apps have shortcuts. Just tap and hold any stock app icon like Calendar, Camera, Messenger or Dialler. This brings up a list of quick actions above the icon. Adjust icon/screen size: In Settings > Display there's a new option to adjust the size of onscreen content and icons. Simply select the Display size option and move the slider until the icons are the size you want them to be. Enable developer settings: To turn on the developer settings, head into Settings > About phone. Scroll to the bottom and repeatedly tap on the Build number. After a number of taps, you'll unlock the developer options. Unlock System UI Tuner: This is a clever hidden setting that offers a range of options you can't otherwise get to. Swipe down the Quick Settings and press and hold the settings cog at the top next to the battery. After a long press, the System UI Tuner will be unlocked, and a new option will appear in the settings menu. There's a more detailed step-by-step guide here if you need more help. Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Which should you choose? Apple iPhone to Google Pixel: How to transfer contacts, messages, calendars and media Transfer everything from your iPhone: As part of the set up process, you can transfer all your contacts, messages, emails, calendar appointments, attachments and media across to your new Pixel phone from your iPhone. The video below shows how to do it. Show the battery percentage: Once you've unlocked the System UI Tuner (as above), you have the option to show the battery percentage in the battery icon at all times. (Most third-party skins have this as a default option.) Charge another device: Using the USB Type-C to Type-A adapter that comes in the box, you can use your Pixel to charge another device. Just your other device's cable in to the adapter, and plug it in to your Pixel.  Turn on ambient display: A feature of Android Wear and Motorola devices, it's now on Android Nougat by default. Head into Settings > Display and you'll be able to glance at monochrome notifications. Turn on Night Light: When reading your phone in the evening, the last thing you want is harsh, blue light from your phone screen glaring in to your eyes. To turn on Night Light, giving it a more yellow/warm tone, go to Settings > Display and choose the Night Light. Schedule Night Light: While you can turn on the Night Light manually, it may be more beneficial and less of a chore to schedule it. Simply tap "turn on automatically" and choose the days and times you want, and it’ll come on automatically. Or, you can set it to change by sunrise and sunset times. Play Pixel Android Nougat easter egg: Nougat's Easter Egg is a little different to previous Flappy Bird style games. Instead, you've got to try and catch a cat by selecting a tasty treat. Head into Settings > About phone/tablet > Android version. Then tap the Android version repeatedly until it changes to the Android N screen. Once you have the full Android "N" logo visible, tap repeatedly, then press and hold, then you should see a little cat icon appear on the screen. Watch the video below to see an overview on how to play the game. Search settings: Rather than rooting through everything, you can search the settings. Just open up the Settings menu and hit the magnifying glass and type what you're looking for. Search Google for onscreen info: In other phones, this is called Now on Tap, in the Pixel, it has been integrated in to the Assistant. Press and hold the home button to launch Google Assistant on any screen that has objects/text on it, then swipe up on the card border that appears at the bottom of the chat. Assistant will then offer various services to search for that information, videos or locations with. Find the Google Settings: There was previously an app to handle Google settings, in Nougat this is now in the main Settings menu. This is where you'll find settings for accounts and services, backup, and transferring content to a nearby device. Use the native file explorer: There's a file explorer in Android. Head to Settings > Storage and scroll to the bottom of the list. Tap Explore and you can view folders, open files, delete and share. Google Pixel Moves tips Android has had a number of features launch-able by gesture for a few years now. With the Google Pixel, and Android 7.1 Nougat, those get their own "Moves" section within the main settings app. Just head to Settings > Moves, and check out the three options available. Swipe for notifications: With this option switched on, you can swipe downwards on your Pixel Imprint sensor and it'll drop down the notifications from the top of your screen. Swipe it again and you'll get quick settings. Jump to camera: This feature isn't entirely new, but when switched on, you can double-click the power/sleep button from any screen and launch the camera app. Flip camera: Another camera related one, and when activated you can switch in and out of selfie mode with a quick double-twist of the phone. In previous years, this gesture would launch the camera, so it's been tweaked a little. Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android? Google Pixel apps tips and tricks Since phone screen sizes have been on the increase, it makes sense to make better use of that real estate. Along with a number of other additions, you can now have two apps running side-by-side on the same screen. You also get the same granular controls on apps that you got in Android Marshmallow. Split-screen multitasking: Android Nougat is the first version of the OS to feature built-in split-screen multitasking. You can activate it a number of ways (as detailed in the video below), but the easiest is just to press and hold the recent apps button. You can also reposition where the split appears onscreen. Switch quickly between recent apps: From any screen, you can quickly switch back and forth between the two most recent apps by double tapping the recent apps button. Stop adding new app icons to home screen: If you don't want newly installed apps cluttering up your home screen, head into Play Store > Settings and uncheck the "Add icon to Home screen" box. Enable fingerprint authentication: You can use the Pixel Imprint sensor to authenticate Google Play purchases with your fingerprint. Simply head to the Play Store > Settings, check the relevant box and confirm by typing in your password. Clear all apps from your recent memory: Tap the recent apps button to see all the apps running, scroll to the top of the screen and choose "clear all". Add Yahoo! Mail or Exchange to Gmail: You can add Yahoo!, Exchange or other mail services to Gmail. Tap the icon to open the sidebar, scroll all the way to the bottom and hit Settings > Add account. You have the option for Google, IMAP/POP3 services (like Yahoo, Outlook.com) and Exchange. Attach anything to Gmail: Tap the attachment button and you can attach local files, things in Drive, Photos, Dropbox files, OneDrive box and so on. It's really flexible. Customise Google Now: Go to your Google Now screen and access the sidebar menu. Find settings and use it to customise which cards appear, what language you use as well as privacy settings. Change the default app: Android lets you decide which is the default app, if you have more than one that will do the same thing. In Settings > Apps, hit the settings cog in the top corner. Here you'll see a list of defaults you can change. Control app permissions: Nougat, like Marshmallow did, lets you manage all the permissions for each app on an individual basis. Go to Apps and select the app and hit Permissions. This will let you toggle permissions on and off, so you can disable location access, for example. Android 7.0 Nougat review: Subtle but super-sweet OS update Google Pixel notifications and volume tips and tricks Notification fine-tuning has been ramped up a notch with Nougat. It's no longer a case of just having priority or non-priority, but you also get to choose which exact level of priority an application should have, as well as replying directly from a notification. Turn on the notifications light: The normal flashing notifications LED is turned off on the Pixel by default. To switch it on, head into Settings > Notifications and hit the cog in the top right. Here you'll find the option to "pulse notification light". Enable power notifications: Go to System UI Tuner in your settings (having enabled it using the method near the top of this article) and choose other > Power notification controls. On the next screen switch the toggle to the on position. Once enabled you can fine-tune the priority level of any app's notification. Direct reply: With Android Nougat, you can direct reply from any app that has this feature built in. Swipe down on any notification card and if there's a "reply" option, hit it and type away without leaving the screen. This works for loads of apps, including Hangouts, WhatsApp and Messenger. Quickly switch to vibrate alerts: If you want silence, but are after vibration alerts still, then push the volume button and tap the bell on the pop-up. This will switch to vibrate. Turn down media volume: Hit the volume up or down button, and the volume slider will appear. Tap the down arrow on the right-hand side, and you can change the ringer, media or alarm volumes. Engage Do not Disturb: Swipe down Quick Settings and tap the Do Not Disturb button. This gives you the option to have total silence, alarms only, or priority only. You can choose if this is for a time period, or until you turn it off. Schedule Do not Disturb: Swipe down Quick Settings then press and hold the Do Not Disturb button. Choose Automatic Rules and customise which times the Do not Disturb feature should activate automatically. To mark an app as a Priority app: Head into Settings > Apps. Tap on the app you want. In Notifications you get app controls, and you can set an app as a priority so you always get notifications from that app. To turn off notifications on an app: Go to Settings > Apps > Tap on the app you want. In Notifications you can block all notifications for any app on your device. To turn off peeking on an app: Go to Settings > Apps > Tap on the app you want. In Notifications you can turn off peeking, so you don't get a toast notification for that app. Instant access to lock screen notifications: Just tap a notification twice and it will open up the app. Want to dismiss it? Just swipe it away. Expand stacked notifications: Got a stack of notifications? You can drag down to expand them, both on the lock screen and in the notifications area. Hide sensitive information in lock screen notifications: You can have lock screen notifications without too much information being revealed. Head to Settings > Notifications and tap the cog in the top right. This will give you a menu option called "On the lock screen". You can then select the option you want. You're also given this option during setup.  Each individual app also has lock screen controls, so in Settings > Apps, tap the app you want. You'll find the option under "On the lock screen" again. This will enable you to turn off lock screen notifications for a specific app, but not others. Pocket-lint Google Pixel: Assistant tips One of Google's big plays with the Pixel is Google Assistant. This is an evolution of the voice-control options presented by the Ok Google hot word and the smart personal offering of Google Now. Here's some top tips to get you started with Google Assistant, but if you want more, we have a comprehensive breakdown of Google Assistant tips in a separate feature. Access Google Assistant: A long press on the home button will activate Google Assistant and take you through to the interface where you can talk to, or type to interact with Assistant. You will also be served results that you can tap to get more information, or to move through to over apps. Turn on the Ok Google hot word: If you want to use voice, you'll have to turn it on and register your Ok Google voice. The best way to do this is to open Google Assistant (as above) and tap the menu in the top right corner, open Settings. You'll see "Ok Google" detection in the next page, to get you started. Open an app with Google Assistant: Simply say "Ok Google, open Netflix" and it will open Netflix or any other app. It's smart too, as for some apps, Assistant can navigation content within them - like watching a specific show on Netflix, or playing a specific artist on Spotify. I'm feeling lucky: If you're looking for Google Assistant's Easter Egg, trying saying "I'm feeling lucky". This will take you to a crazy trivia quiz that's loads of fun. View photos of dogs, babies, cars: Google Assistant ties closely into other Google apps, especially Photos. If you have photos in your account of specific things, Google Assistant can find them. Try asking to see photos of your dog, and you'll get photos of your dog. Make sure, however, that your Google Assistant account is the same as the Photos account, for this cross-pollination to work. Android Assistant tips and tricks: Master your Android assistant Google Pixel Quick Settings tips Quick settings were good before, now they're even better. There are more options and there's far greater customisation. Manage Quick tiles: In Android 7.1 you can manage the order of the quick settings tiles by dropping down the usual shade from the top of the screen and hitting "edit". Now you can re-order, and even add new quick access toggles for things like Google Cast, Night Light, data saver and such. Enable Night Light: Using the method above, add the Night Light tile to your quick settings tiles. Once it's there, just tap to activate it or press and hold to access night mode settings to customise. Enable data saver: Just like above, you can add the data saver toggle to your quick tiles. In essence it helps you limit how much of your data the phone consumes by limiting how much data apps use in the background. Quickly select a Wi-Fi network: Swipe down for Quick Settings, then click the network name beneath the Wi-Fi icon. This takes you through to the Wi-Fi settings. Quickly manage Bluetooth: The same applies to Bluetooth. Click beneath the Bluetooth icon in Quick Settings and you'll head into settings to select your device. Turn on torch/flashlight: There's no need for a separate app, just tap the button in Quick Settings to turn on your flash as a torch. Or just say "Ok Google, turn on torch/flashlight" and it will turn on. Cast your screen: Want your Android device on your TV? Just swipe down and tap Cast screen and it will be sent to your Chromecast. If it's not there, add the Cast tile to your Quick Settings using the method mentioned above. Not all apps are supported though. Google Pixel battery tips and tricks Having brought Android Marshmallow's Doze mode across - and enhanced it - Nougat is already great at conserving energy, but now it's even easier to get a picture of what your battery is doing and how you can optimise its use further. See your battery percentage: Open Quick Settings with a two-finger swipe. Your battery percentage is displayed in the quick settings screen. Tap the icon to see a more detailed overview. Time till fully charged: Charge time is displayed when connected to a charger. Look at the bottom of the lock screen and in the battery status screen, but it takes a little while for Android to calculate how long charging will take. If you're fast charging, it will say "charging rapidly”. See what's eating battery: Swipe down Quick Settings, tap the battery icon and tap "more settings". You'll go to the battery status page and see how long you have left and what apps are eating your battery. Turn on battery saver: Drop down the Quick Settings, tap the battery icon and toggle Battery saver to the on position. If you want to set it up to switch on automatically when it hits 5 per cent or 15 per cent, hit "more settings" and tap the battery saver option at the top of the screen. Google Pixel multiple user tips Whether you want to add new user profiles or make it easier to get to your emergency information, Nougat has you covered. Add emergency information: Go to Settings > Users then select Emergency Information. Here you can add contact details, medical conditions and any medication you're currently taking. Guest profile: In the same area (Settings > Users) you can create a Guest profile. While it is setup, you'll get the option to access as a guest from the lock screen. See how much storage they're using: If you want to know how much space is being used up by another profile, head into Settings > Storage. At the bottom of the list it says how much other profile and the guest is using. Pocket-lint Google Pixel camera tips The camera app in Android 7.1 on the Pixel is far simpler and more intuitive to use than many other camera apps. There are a few things worth looking at, however, that aren't obvious from the very beginning. Switch on 4K video recording: By default, Google Pixel records video in 1080p resolution. In the camera app, access the side menu by tapping the three lines in the top corner, choose settings and scroll down to "Back camera video resolution". Slow motion video: Access the side menu again, and choose "Slow motion" from the list of familiar photo modes. These include panorama, lens blur and Photo Sphere. Manually change exposure: Although there's no full manual mode, you can manually adjust exposure in any scene. Simply tap the area you want to focus on, then you'll see a slider appear on the right side of the screen. Sliding up brightens the scene, down darkens it. Manually adjust white balance: Pixel sometimes has a tendency of getting white balance wrong. In the camera app, tap the thermometer icon at the top of the screen and choose the preset that best suits your lighting. Shoot burst photos: To shoot a really fast burst of photos, just press and hold the shutter button on the screen. Lock the focus and exposure: Called AF/AE lock, this feature will mean that things stay in the same focal point and exposure, even when the subject changes. It's idea for video consistency or more deliberate shots. Just tap as you would to focus and keep pressing. You'll see the circle around your finger fill and go solid, then you're AF/AE locked. Google Pixel Security tips Manage fingerprints: Head into Security > Pixel Imprint and you'll be able to add or remove fingerprints that will unlock your device. A pro tip is to register fingers on both hands so you can unlock your phone with whichever hand you have free. Bluetooth unlock: Again in Security > Smart Lock, you have the option to nominate trusted devices, so your Android will unlock when connected to something else. You can nominate Bluetooth devices (like your smartwatch or car Bluetooth) or select an NFC tag. Google Pixel keyboard and language tips Typing should always be easy and personally tuned to your needs, and with Nougat on the Pixel, that's even easier thanks to the ability to support multiple languages and customise the keyboard. Add multiple languages: Go to settings then languages & input, tap languages and then "add a language". There are dozens of languages available to use (including Welsh). Change themes: Head to Settings>Languages & input>Virtual keyboard, then select Google keyboard at the top of the page. Select theme and choose one of the available colours or just add your own image as a background. Toggle the key border if you want one. Enable one-handed mode: When the keyboard is onscreen, tap and hold the return key. Select the icon that looks like a hand holding a phone. Switch the keyboard to the left side of the screen by tapping the chevron on the left side. Change keyboard height: Once again in the virtual keyboard settings, select the Google keyboard and choose Preferences. Find Keyboard height in the list and adjust the slider until the keyboard is at your required height.

Google Stock Will Rely Ever More on Hardware. The Shift Has Worked Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), also known as Google, has gradually started to move beyond software. The company wants to become a true hardware manufacturer. The new "Pixel" and "Pixel XL" phones are an important step in this direction. The Google car project is another, but it remains in the research and development (R&D) stage for now. The Pixel phones, rather, will be generating revenue, and it looks like they will be successful.

The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. Google has been synonymous with innovation. This time, with a brand new Android OS Nougat and Google Assistant, Pixel devices are set to counter Apple's iOS 10 and intelligent assistant Siri. Let us see what the 5.5-inch Pixel XL (32GB, black colour) has for Indian consumers who are searching for a premium smartphone. The aluminum and glass-built device looks elegant and fits comfortably in the palm. Unlike Nexus 6P, which had a thin glass strip at the top, Pixel XL's back panel has almost one-third glass covering. Putting an end to Android users' long wait, the Google Assistant in Pixel XL definitely has an edge over Apple's Siri. See for yourself. When asked, :Are you a man or a woman?", Google Assistant responded with answers like "I'm all inclusive :D" and "Does it really matter?" while Siri staidly replied: "I was not assigned a gender." Caption: The newly launched Rs 67,000 Google Pixel XL has Google Assistant built in. The device runs on Android Nougat 7.1 OS. To "Who will win the US presidential election?" Google Assistant displayed poll results by the New York Times, The Telegraph and Independent while Siri returned Wikipedia and Quora with an iOS 10-powered iPhone. While searching restaurants near our office, Google Assistant displayed food joints as close as 300 metres while Siri said that the nearest restaurant is 600 metres away. To further test its intelligence, Google Assistant was asked, "Who is Siri?" It explained, "Siri is Apple's intelligent assistant. She is very witty." Siri, however, was more informative than Google Assistant when asked "Who is the Prime Minister of India?". While Siri threw up results like when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister and how long has he been serving, Google Assistant came back only with his name. Google Assistant can tell jokes, remember your passwords and even set the alarm for you in a clear voice. The "Pixel Imprint" fingerprint scanner is located at the back and is extremely responsive. It not only unlocked the device in a split second but also accepted (authorised) half a fingerprint for unlocking. While lock and volume up/down buttons are on the right of the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protected AMOLED display, a nano-SIM slot sits at the left bumper of the device. Google has retained Type-C charging port that charged the 3450 mAh battery in a flat 48 minutes. The device with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 Quad core processor and 4GB DDR4 RAM will get first updates and free unlimited cloud space is not to be missed. Google has put in a lot of accessories inside the box, including a two-way Type-C port cable ensuring OTG device (also included) support. With this cable, one can charge Pixel XL with another phone having a Type-C port. The smartphone runs like a charm on Android Nougat 7.1 - the only device till date to have it. The apps explorer icon is replaced by a pull-up App Drawer which is more convenient. Caption: Google Pixel XL has the best camera rating ever. The photos were taken in the night and are displayed without any editing. A swipe right on the screen brings the notable search results in line with browsing history. When we swiped right, information about the FC Barcelona vs Manchester City football match; updates about the Indian Soccer League tournament; and scores for the India vs New Zealand One-Day cricket match popped up. Pixel's 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 has been rated the highest ever 89 DxOMark Mobile score. It is very fast, responsive and has a video stabilising mode. As expected, the photos in broad daylight were stunning. Even in "very low light conditions", the camera did not disappoint. Under natural light at 7 pm, the photos clicked without flash had clarity and little grains while the photo taken with flash were sharper. As compared to shooting video in normal mode, we noticed a remarkable difference when we shot the same video with "Video Stabilisation" on. There were low or no jerks and no picture distortion. The 8MP camera works fine and while using it with Google's video calling app Duo, the receiver gets a sharper image (as compared to the Nexus 6P). One can even try new gestures, relish the audio output and save unlimited data online in original quality for free. What doesn't work? Pixel devices are not waterproof. At a time when Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (and the now discontinued Galaxy Note 7) and Apple are offering IP68 rating (waterproof ratings), Pixel smartphones fall behind in this category. The camera does not have an optical image stabilisation feature and the Type-C to Type-C charging is slow. Conclusion: If you think about shelling out Rs 72000 for the 32GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus, consider Google Pixel XL for Rs 67000 as your date with Google Assistant will floor you without any doubt.

Cabral/Dubai Filed on October 21, 2016 Share More > Vote Apple's iPhone has been a dominant force in the smartphone world for years, and Google is determined to challenge that with its new Pixel. Is the Mountain View team indeed ready to challenge the dominance of Cupertino? Google just declared war on everyone, and they just have the right amount of resources to do so. Veering away from its Nexus line, the Internet giant finally decided that it was time for them to start giving others a run for their money with its own smartphone, the Pixel. And with Samsung charred from the Galaxy Note 7 mess, it's a perfect opportunity for the rest of the Android mob to take their shots at Apple - and Google is just raring to go. Let's see how Apple's signature flagship and Google's new toy stack up against each other. At the end of each parameter, we'll have a scoreboard (in an iPhone 7-Pixel format) to see where we're clawing towards to. Front camera: The iPhone 7 has a wider aperture, but the Pixel has a higher resolution. The tie-breaker would then be the iPhone 7's Retina flash. 1-0. Audio: A dual-speaker stereo system on the iPhone 7 versus the Pixel's single downward-firing one? Easy. 2-0. Memory: While the Pixel edges out the iPhone 7 in RAM (4GB to 3GB), the latter has more storage options; the 32/128GB choices on both cancel each other out, leaving the iPhone 7's massive 256GB on top. But since you may not require that much space on your phone, let's give RAM some preference here. 2-1. Display: The Pixel has a larger five-inch screen compared to the iPhone 7's standard-issue 4.7 inches, and it also uses AMOLED, brighter than the latter's LCD. Google's device also has a higher resolution and pixel density, though Apple has its own 3D Touch for added functionality (if you actually use it). Make no mistake, the iPhone 7 has a great display, but the numbers point to the Pixel tying things up. 2-2. Platform: It's iOS versus Android. 10 against 7.1 Nougat. Each system has its own crowd and functionalities, so we'll leave it at that. Digital assistant: Siri, meet your new rival, Google Assistant. And it seems that you're about to get a run for your money if the latter's demonstration at the Pixel launch event was any indication, in which it flaunted some really interactive "dialogues". 2-3. Fingerprint scanner: The iPhone 7 retains this on its home button up front, while the Pixel has its own on the rear. Normally, most of us hold our phones with our thumb and index finger on those positions, respectively, so it's really a matter of what suits you better. So let's move on. Main camera: While both practically have 12MP shooters, the iPhone has a wider aperture and optical image stabilisation, while also outshining (pun intended) the Pixel's dual-LED flash with its quad-LED flash. And most importantly, the iPhone 7's snapper has proven that it is really better in low-light conditions compared to its predecessors. 3-3. Chipset: Let's see... the Apple A10 Fusion chip gives 40 per cent faster performance at one-fifth the power and 50 per cent better graphics thanks to an M10 motion coprocessor, while the Snapdragon 821 blurts out a 10 per cent faster performance than the 820. Oh well. 4-3. Build: Apple was wise to bring out the Jet Black colour. With design mostly another user-preference judgment, let's take this one to durability: the iPhone 7 is dust- and water-resistant - as we proved ourselves just to get a kick out of it - while the Pixel can, well, take just sprays of water. And it helps when Jony Ive is on your bench. 5-3. Battery: The Pixel's 2770mAh power pack clobbers the iPhone 7's 1960mAh. But note to both: seriously, can't you stick in larger batteries? (It should be noted, though, that the iPhone 7 lasts longer - up to two hours, Apple says - than the 6s.) 5-4. Connectivity: Not a few people were ticked off when Apple removed the 3.5mm audio jack, leaving the iPhone 7 with only one port for connecting an audio device or charger. Apple may have viewed it as some sort of future-proofing (obviously not everyone agreed), but Google did a better thing at it by slapping in a USB Type-C on the Pixel... and retaining good ol' jack on top. 5-5. Well, that was a close, tense one. We may have ended up tied in our mano-y-mano, but the real winner is for you to decide. (Why not get one of each to spare you the trouble?)

When we swiped right, information about the FC Barcelona vs Manchester City football match; updates about the Indian Soccer League tournament; and scores for the India vs New Zealand One-Day cricket match popped up. Pixel's 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 has been rated the highest ever 89 DxOMark Mobile score. It is very fast, responsive and has a video stabilising mode. As expected, the photos in broad daylight were stunning. Even in "very low light conditions", the camera did not disappoint. Under natural light at 7 pm, the photos clicked without flash had clarity and little grains while the photo taken with flash were sharper. As compared to shooting video in normal mode, we noticed a remarkable difference when we shot the same video with "Video Stabilisation" on. There were low or no jerks and no picture distortion. The 8MP camera works fine and while using it with Google's video calling app Duo, the receiver gets a sharper image (as compared to the Nexus 6P). One can even try new gestures, relish the audio output and save unlimited data online in original quality for free. What doesn't work? Pixel devices are not waterproof. At a time when Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (and the now discontinued Galaxy Note 7) and Apple are offering IP68 rating (waterproof ratings), Pixel smartphones fall behind in this category. The camera does not have an optical image stabilisation feature and the Type-C to Type-C charging is slow. Conclusion: If you think about shelling out Rs 72000 for the 32GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus, consider Google Pixel XL for Rs 67000 as your date with Google Assistant will floor you without any doubt.

You’ll also find that, when it comes to content marketing, it’s much easier to repurpose old content than it is to create new content. One of the biggest problems faced by content marketers is coming up with new ideas. Although fresh content is certainly needed on a regular basis, recycled old content will often do wonders when you’re suffering from writer’s block and looking for ways to increase your reach. In fact, you should never forget about your old content. Every piece of content on your site is a representation of your brand. It can rank, get shared on social media, and convert. Editor Note: want to learn more about content marketing? Download our content marketing ebook. Here are a few ways you can repurpose some of your past content. 1. Convert it to Video (And Try Some of the New Formats) Your old content is probably a blog post containing mostly text. Use that text as narration or subject matter in a video. I do this all the time. Often, I will comb back through an old blog post and then create a video on the same topic. That video can then be used on that same page and add to the quality of the post. Creating the video is the hard part… Here are a few options. Cover main points in the blog and record your screen. This will allow you to show visuals online. Take the blog post and convert it into slides. Add photos to those slides and make a video in the webinar format. Turn the blog into a presentation and give the presentation on camera (you can use a whiteboard, projector or just wing it). Set up a camera and simply talk about the most important parts of the blog post. Do a Facebook Live recap of the post and save the recording (Periscope and Meerkat are also options). Once your video is complete and uploaded to YouTube (or another site such as Vimeo, Facebook, Tumblr, etc) you’re still not done. You are going to want to do the following. Embed the video on the original blog post (this will add to the quality of this post) Run ads for the video and the blog post on YouTube and Facebook Send the link to the blog or video out in your email newsletter Promote, promote, promote. 2. Make it an Infographic Everybody loves infographics. That’s because so many people are overworked and need to digest information as quickly as possible, preferably in visual format instead of lengthy, written text. Infographics win on both those points. They make it easy for readers to get a quick understanding of a subject while offering graphics that support and illustrate the main points. If you’ve got some great informational content that went viral in the past and you’re looking for a way to repurpose it, consider turning it into an infographic. It’s a good idea to review pages on your site that are ranking for large terms in Google, and review your top landing page reports in Google Analytics, and use that data to determine the largest opportunities. You might be concerned that you could have trouble creating an infographic because you’re not that good with graphics tools like Adobe Photoshop. If so, set your mind at ease. There are websites that will enable you to create a great infographic, even if you’re artistically challenged. For example, Piktochart makes it a snap to create high-quality infographics at an affordable monthly price. You can also try 99designs or hire someone on Upwork. There are also a number of free infographics tools that you can choose from. Keep in mind: with the prevalence of tools on the market, you’ll find it’s much easier to create infographics than videos. So, if time is of the essence in your situation, your best bet is probably to repurpose your content into infographic format as opposed to video format. Also, be sure to brand your infographic so that even when people copy just the image and post it on their own blogs, you’ll still be tooting your own horn. 3. Create a Listicle From Tags or Categories You’re probably using WordPress for your content marketing. You’ll find that it can be your very best friend when it comes to repurposing old content. That’s because WordPress allows you to tag and categorize blog posts (never use both, unless you want a duplicate content issue by the way). And, as a great digital marketer, you’ve been doing that with all of your posts for some time. Now, pick a tag or subject from your history of posts and take a go over the articles you’ve written. Look for a way to convert some of your old posts into listicle format. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of a listicle: it’s an article in list format. It’s a concept popularized by sites like BuzzFeed. For example, if you have a blog about online marketing and one of your more popular tags is “social media,” you might find that you’ve written some very good articles about how to use social media for marketing over the past year. Make the topic of each one of those articles a point in your new listicle and include a synopsis of the original post. In this case, you might come up with a title like: “10 Social Media Strategies You Forgot to Use This Past Year (That Really Matter).” Each one of those 10 points is the subject of one of the articles you’ve already written. Bonus: when you repurpose your content with this method, you’ll also link back to the article that you originally wrote. That gives you a great excuse for some additional internal linkage. Google will jump back into those pages, crawl them again and give them a fresh boost. Even better, update the content on each of the posts you are linking to before you publish your listicle. That way you will see a big boost. 4. Convert it Into a SlideShare Presentation SlideShare might be one of the most under-utilized resources for digital marketers. That’s certainly not for lack of promotion – there are countless blog posts extolling the virtues of using SlideShare for brand promotion. And yet many people ignore it. If you’re looking for a great way to repurpose some old content into something that’s fresh and exciting, consider translating that old post into a SlideShare presentation. Slide presentations give you another great opportunity to educate people without requiring them to invest a lot of time reading a lengthy article. Great presentations offer only the most important points of a subject and back them up with stats, graphs, and images. You can also embed a SlideShare presentation just like you embed a YouTube video, image, or tweet. Just click the “Share” button at the bottom of the slideshow and copy the “Embed” code to your own blog. 5. Make it Into a Podcast If you’re looking for an astonishingly easy way to repurpose old content, consider using it in a podcast. Podcasts are popular with online marketers these days. That’s for a good reason: they give you an opportunity to boost your brand in a medium that people can use while occupied in some other way (like driving). One great way to get on the podcast map while simultaneously reusing old content is to record yourself reading a blog post and then use that recording in a podcast. That’s simple and inexpensive. Keep in mind, though, that if you don’t have a “radio voice,” you should consider getting somebody else to read your article for you. Sure, you’ll have to pay some cash for that, unless you have that talent in-house. You won’t have to pay much cash, though. There are people who do voice-overs on Fiverr for the unsurprising cost of $5. Hire them and you can outsource the whole thing. Neil Patel and Eric Siu have been doing this recently on Stitcher. Their new podcast is pretty good. 6. Use it in an Email Blast If you’re successful at email marketing, then you’re always signing up new people to your email list. Some of your more recent recruits might not be too familiar with the subjects covered in your older blog posts. That’s why it’s a great idea to repurpose old content and include it in an email that you send to all your followers. You’ll give the newbies a chance to get caught up on some of your older principles while reminding the veterans about what’s important. This is another easy way to repurpose. In many cases, it just involves copying and pasting old paragraphs and including a few relevant updates. Most smart marketers will create a drip campaign that sends out 5 to 20 of their best articles to new email subscribers over the course of a couple of months. This keeps the subscribers engaged and coming back to the site. 7. Aggregate Related Posts Into an E-Book Are you looking to establish yourself as an authority in your space with the publication of an e-book? If so, then you might find that task easier than you realize. Why? Because the book might already be written. In your own blog. Go through your past posts. Find related articles and aggregate them into one giant e-book. Make each post its own chapter in the book. See how easy that is? Of course, you’re not done once you’ve completed your copy-and-paste effort. You still want to invest some time and money into making your e-book look attractive. In the end, you can always upload your e-book to Amazon and either sell it or give it away. Best part, you get a link from Amazon and you can add your blogs RSS feed to the publisher area. I launched my first book on Amazon this year and it ended up being a great thing for our company. I was able to take most of my best work and merge it into one place. 8. Repost Evergreen Content on Social Media Do you have some fantastic evergreen content on your site that went viral a while ago? If so, there’s no reason why you can’t share it again. The best social media managers always tweet the best posts once every month or two. Why? They know it will always be a hit. You never let a good post die. You should always be refreshing and re-sharing. For example, if you invested $5,000 in writing the ultimate guide to content marketing and that article was a big hit with your audience, use your social media channels to re-post the link. Each time you share it, change the social media text a little and make sure to update the content on your guides quarterly at least. 9. Turn it Into a Webinar Another popular fad with modern digital strategists is the webinar. It’s also a great way to repurpose old content. If you’ve got a particularly popular and informative article on your blog, consider turning it into a webinar. Again: this is a great way to kill two birds with one stone. You’ll not only repurpose your old content, but you’ll also have great material for a successful webinar. The key to a successful webinar isn’t just the content, though. You’ll need to make sure that you promote it effectively. Otherwise, you’re going to be talking to yourself. Get Started Now You don’t have to struggle to find completely original content for every marketing channel. Instead, just repurpose some of your old content and share it in ways that you haven’t used before. Many of the really good marketers swear by this strategy. Personally, I am a big fan of it. Update your old content, repurpose your old content, and keep sharing it. Many times, this is a better option than simply creating something new.   Image Credits Featured Image: HappyCity/DepositPhotos.com In-post Photo #1: Image by John Lincoln In-post Photo #2: Image by John Lincoln All screenshots by John Lincoln.

By Sarmistha Acharya October 21, 2016 07:12 BST Google Assistant can be enabled on non-Pixel phonesXDA The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones to ship with built-in Google Assistant feature. For the uninitiated, Google Assistant is Google's intelligent personal assistant, which was unveiled at its annual I/O developer conference in May 2016. Considered to be a new version of Google Now, Google Assistant is available in English and German on Pixel phones and in Google Allo messaging app. The web search giant promises to bring more language support for the Assistant. Like any other virtual assistant, you can get answers and finish tasks using Google Assistant, like getting weather updates, finding local info, checking for flight timings and translations. Want Google Assistant on your phone? While Google has limited the use of Google Assistant, there is a workaround through which you can get Google Assistant working on your Android device. All you need is a device running on Android 7.0 or, higher, with latest the Google app version 6.5.35.21 or newer. If you meet these requirements, then you can get Google Assistant working on your phone. XDA forum member, brianelv, has shared methods detailing how to get Google Assistant: one via tweaking the build.prop and the other one by flashing the zip file through recovery. The member claims the feature is working on Nexus 6P, 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 5, Nexus 4, Pixel C, Moto G 2013 and 2015, OnePlus One, Lenovo VIBE K5 Plus and YU Yureka Plus. Check out the following guides to enable Google Assistant on your phone. But note that IBTimes UK cannot be held liable for any damage to the device. Method 1: Add or replace the following lines on your build.prop ro.product.model=Pixel XL ro.opa.eligible_device=true Method 2: This method is by installing the zip files via custom recovery, as you do to install custom ROM or modes. Download the three files from here Copy the downloaded files to your phone's storage Boot your phone in to custom recovery From recovery mode, first flash GoogleAssistantvelvet.zip Then flash GoogleAssistantBuildprop.zip GoogleAssistantVelvet.zip will install new Google Velvet app as a system app, whereas GoogleAssistantBuildProp.zip will search for the tweak.prop file. This contains the lines for build.prop. Troubleshoot: If you are still having Google Now, go to Google app info and wipe the data. If your camera app keeps crashing, restore your build.prop and use the new method for build. Prop. The Ok Google voice command might not work. It works only on Nexus devices running stock firmware.

As Voice Search Gains Importance, So Does Schema Mark-Up for SMB Sites (Street Fight) Eric Owen: Like it or not, SMBs have become far more educated and sophisticated with regard to digital media, and are in a much better position to hold their providers accountable. As a result, providers now must look for ways to more cost effectively provide higher quality products. Google To Launch Click-to-Message Ads on Google Search in Coming Weeks (Venture Beat) That Google is pushing mobile messaging as an extra channel through which customers can converse with companies isn’t entirely surprising.

Today, range anxiety is far more ubiquitous due to our pocket supercomputers. Not only are we worried about our smartphone’s battery lasting the day, but also whether its memory will be sufficient to hold all those photos, videos, songs, apps and software updates. This problem is a moving target. As the resolution of mobile cameras improves, image sizes increase, particularly with 4K video. Apps and games are becoming more sophisticated, consuming more processing power. A lot has to do with users: the more time we spend staring at our screens, the faster the batteries drain. Makers have been slow to compensate for the increasing strain we put on our phones. The latest handsets from Apple and Google go some way to solving it, with more storage — on the device and in the cloud — and much-improved battery life. Longevity is relevant because both companies are pushing their phones into the most demanding territory yet, by trying to turn them into personal portable concierges. Lookalike hardware I have been testing the iPhone 7 Plus alongside the Google Pixel XL for about a week. (I prefer the more expensive larger phones, but most points in this review also apply to their small-screen siblings.) The Pixel is the latest in a long line of would-be “iPhone killers” from Google. I loved last year’s Nexus 6P but Google argues that the Pixel is different because it had greater involvement in shaping both hardware (which is built by HTC) and software. That approach of tying the two together has been Apple’s playbook for decades, so it is disappointing that the Pixel is not more distinctive. Its rounded black rectangle is different primarily because the fingerprint reader is on the back. It lacks the iPhone’s camera bump but as a result, the wedge-shaped handset is slightly thicker, though also lighter and shorter than its rival. I asked both phones to ‘show me photos of camping’. Siri heard me right first time but Assistant showed web search results for ‘my face has a campaign’ When it comes to software, inspiration seems to be travelling in the opposite direction. A new feature of iOS 10 apes Google Now: swipe sideways from the iPhone’s homescreen to see live widgets, such as the weather, calendar and suggested apps based on time, place and user habits. In many ways, the devices are evenly matched. Both excel on battery life. Whereas previous iPhones and Android devices often failed to last a full day (I admit to being a heavier user than most), I often went to bed without even hitting the “red zone” of low power on either device. Battery management software in both Android and iOS now kicks in to preserve the life of the phone by cutting background processes to essentials, such as calls and texts. Anyone who shares my daily frustration with battery life would benefit from upgrading. There is one crucial difference in endurance between the two devices, though: the iPhone 7 is waterproof while the Pixel is not. Clouds apart FT on WhatsApp Get the FT’s daily editor’s pick on WhatsApp Where the two devices begin to part ways is in their connected cloud services, which are key to alleviating the pressure on internal memory. Google’s neat solution to this kind of range anxiety is “Smart Storage”. If your device is running low on memory, flip a switch in the settings and it will delete older images that have been backed up to the cloud on Google Photos. It is also offering Pixel owners unlimited storage on Google Photos at full resolution — including hefty 4K videos. Even if you do not own a Pixel, Google is already slightly more generous with its free cloud storage than Apple. Where iCloud offers only 5GB free, Google allows 15GB — but that has to cover Gmail and Drive storage as well as photos. Pricing for extra storage evens out: Apple charges $1 a month for 50GB, Google charges $2 for 100GB. Apple has a 200GB tier for $3 and both offer 1TB for $10 a month. Digital butler All this cloud storage, however, is only useful if you have a good search tool to find your files once uploaded. Pixel is the first phone to feature Google Assistant, a digital butler that is accessed Siri-style by pressing and holding the home button or calling out “OK Google”. I found Assistant good but not significantly better than Siri. In one test, I asked both Siri and Assistant to “show me photos of camping” from the large library of images I had previously uploaded to both Apple and Google’s clouds. Siri heard me right first time and produced about a dozen pictures. Most were of the tent from my most recent camping trip and a few were random outdoorsy photos that were taken nowhere near a campsite. Not terrible but not particularly comprehensive, especially as I’ve been using iCloud to back up my pictures for years. Wearable technology Personal tech to improve running technique Measuring stride, paces per minute, bounce and foot strike to go faster and limit injuries Assistant first tried to show me web search results for “my face has a campaign”. A second attempt at machine-readable elocution was more successful but showed only web search results of camping pics, not my own pictures. After adding the possessive “Show me my photos of camping”, Google produced many happy camping memories I had uploaded to its Photos service, stretching back more than a decade. These included not just pictures of campsites but fireside suppers and beach walks from the same trips. Bafflingly, however, it did not find the most recent tent photo that Siri did. It is worth noting that Google Photos is also available as a standalone iOS app. It even comes with a “free-up space” option that clears all the original photos from your iPhone once they are backed up to Google. The files will be stored at a lower resolution than if you buy a Pixel, though. Verdict Both the iPhone 7 and Google’s Pixel provide long-overdue ways to mitigate range anxiety. But solving one problem may lead to another kind of nervousness, this time about privacy. Taking full advantage of the Pixel’s cloud back-up and Assistant means going all-in on Google, giving its smartphone constant access to your location, your photos and your most personal information. If that sounds too much to entrust to one company, then combining Apple’s hardware with some of Google’s software may provide a better balance.

As Google releases its Pixel devices, it doesnt want people tinkering too much with an Android Pay enabled device. So the rules are simple: If your device is rooted, no Android Pay, if your devices bootloader is unlocked, no Android Pay either, even if you havent modified the system at all. A Nexus 6P owner discovered that his Android Pay was no longer working because his bootloader was unlocked. Although the phone is not rooted, this is no longer enough for Android Pay to run, the device must have a locked bootloader, and cannot be rooted either. Well this is cool... Updated to the #android 7.1.1 Beta on my Nexus 6P & I can no longer use Android Pay with my unlocked bootloader. Proof pic.twitter.com/spGsqYNTxb ⚡Joey Riz⚡ (@jerflash) October 21, 2016 As Google devices are getting into the hands of not just Android enthusiasts, but also the general public, Google is more concerned about Android Pays security. Allowing Android Pay to work on a rooted device or a device with an unlocked bootloader would be a serious security flaw, as any tinkerer can figure out how the system ticks and potentially steal credit card info, if this happened, it would put a scar on the payment service's reputation. Disabling Android Pay for modified devices is the only way Google can ensure everyones sensitive credit card information is safe. Bummer for those who like to flash ROMs and use Android Pay, as the two can no longer occur in unison.

A good book, like James A. Michener’s novel “Hawaii,” of course. The Acorn’s Flying Squirrel has more. THOR CHALLGREN/Acorn Newspapers After traveling to Hawaii recently, I decided to learn more about the place I’d just visited. For me, the best place to start is in a book. I’m now halfway through James A. Michener’s 1959 epic novel, “Hawaii.” In episodic form, Michener takes you all the way from the island chain’s birth millions of years ago through its first settling by the Polynesians and missionaries and into modern Hawaii (for Michener, the 1950s). Having been to Lahaina in Maui, I have a whole new appreciation for the chapter set during the 1820s, when New England missionaries first came to the Valley Isle. I’m reading this book now, after my trip. But it’s possible the travel experience would have been even better if I’d read it before I went. How do you find books on your destination? Easy. First, if you like a good old-fashioned bookstore, stop by the reference desk and ask them to search their inventory by subject. Some books you’ll find in the travel section, of course, but other titles may appear elsewhere, such as in history, fiction, food or biography. Or try a Google search, using a phrase like “Books to read before traveling to . . . ” As an interesting side note, if you Google the phrase “Books to read before traveling to. . .” : Google auto-populates destinations in this order: Italy, London, Paris, Spain, Scotland. However, if you spell “traveling” with an extra “l” (alternate spelling), you get this list: India, Iceland, South America, Japan, France. Not sure what to make of this. In any case, once you find titles that interest you, order them online or check with your local bookstore, where you can peruse the opening chapters before purchasing the book. I suggest you consider different categories of books: history, food/ culture, fiction and classic literature. Perhaps choose one from each category to read before your trip. For example, let’s say you’re going to Italy and your trip includes stops in Rome, Florence and Venice, with possibly a quick stop in Naples. On the history side, you might consider a book such as “Brunelleschi’s Dome: How a Renaissance Genius Reinvented Architecture,” by Ross King. Having toured the Duomo in Florence and climbed its 463 dizzying steps, I later appreciated reading how Renaissance man Filippo Brunelleschi created what’s still the world’s largest dome. For food and culture, you might consider Fred Plotkin’s “Italy for the Gourmet Traveler,” or any book that helps you appreciate the love and passion Italians put into the food they serve. Knowing which dishes and ingredients are best in each region will elevate your dining experience, and items on a foreign menu become “friends” you’ve read about. Touring the fiction aisle, you have lots of options to choose from to prepare for an Italian trip. Maybe you’ve never read a Dan Brown thriller like “Angels & Demons.” By picking up this title from the library, you’ll be better prepared for your trip to Rome and a possible “Angels & Demons” walking tour that highlights settings in the novel. I’ll confess to having read Thomas Harris’ “Pompeii: A Novel,” an historical fiction account of life in this seaside Italian town circa A.D. 79 and its tragic end at the hands of a certain nearby volcano. Being able to walk through the ruins of the actual city while imagining the lives of the book’s fictional populace truly enhances the touring experience. The final category of reading you might consider would be any classic literature or well-recognized works. Books like Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” Robert Graves’ “I, Claudius” and E.M. Forster’s “A Room With a View” will give you some historical and cultural background, while at the same time letting you feel a little smarter for tackling an English 301-worthy title. You can find books written about any destination you plan to visit, from the Caribbean to Alaska to Asia. With a little advance research and a consistent devotion to picking up what you’ve chosen, you’ll find your next trip infinitely more rewarding for starting your travels in a book.

The update to the suite brings in new features that include automatic allocation in Action Item as well as relevant suggestion options in Forms to help you do the routine jobs in less time. As per the search giant's official blog post, after the update, when you type sentences like "Ryan to follow up on the keynote script," or "Andrea to schedule a weekly check in" on the desktop version of the Docs app, it will use Natural Language Processing to suggest an Action Item to allocate to the respective person using. You can also manually assign an Action Item by mentioning someone's name and choosing it from checkbox in either mobile or desktop apps of Docs, Slides, and Sheets. The concerned person will then receive a notification regarding the same via email.The desktop version as well as mobile apps will now show a badge against the files that have an Action Item assigned to them or any unresolved suggestions made to the file by others, to make it easier for you to find files that need attention. In order to make Forms smarter and make you spend less time while building questions, the company has made use of neural networks. "With the help of neural networks, we can now predict the type of question you're asking and suggest potential responses for you to choose from, giving you back about 25 percent of the time you used to spend creating a Form," company said in its blog post. In Docs on the Web, the company has added support for voice-commands for changing text color, deleting words, inserting links and comments, plus a number of other ways to format. The company has further entered into partnership with messaging platform Slack that allows you to bring files from Google Drive to Slack by simply using the '+' button on the app. You can also create new Docs, Sheets, and Slides files right from inside Slack now.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Daydream View VR headset, Chromecast Ultra now available via Google Store By John Hoff - October 20, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Two of Google’s new hardware additions are now available for you to buy via the Google Store online – the Daydream View VR headset and the Chromecast Ultra. These two pieces of hardware were launched together with Google’s new Pixel smartphones to seemingly launch an era of new Google hardware, and here they are now. The Daydream View VR headset is now available for people to purchase at the announced price of USD$79.00. This VR headset seems to hype on side of comfort, as other VR headsets are pretty much uncomfortable after wearing it for a while. The Daydream View headset is powered by your device, initially the Google Pixel smartphones, but we hope more devices are supported soon. The headset is made with fabric and comfortable material, so you’ll at least be at ease when you use it. The Chromecast Ultra is the upgrade to the second generation Chromecast, and it has grown up more mature than the USD$35 HDMI dongle that it started with. With the Ultra, you now get 4K streaming, support for HDR, and you even get an Ethernet port on the dongle itself – which is perfect for streaming videos in 4K resolution. Of course, the pricing has been bumped up to USD$69 because you know, new features and all that. It’s still a solid buy for you, no matter how you see it. Check out the Google Store for the hardware you’re looking for. Most of the new announcements from Google’s October 4 event are already there, and you can even pre-order Pixel phones (if the pricing is not an issue for you).

The update brings Wi-fi connectivity improvements to the devices and not much else.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google's recently released Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones are set to receive their very first software updates on Oct. 20, according to Verizon. Verizon published the changelogs for both phones on its support site, claiming that the software updates will "optimize device performance, resolve known issues and apply the latest security patches." The update shows the new build number as NDE63P. Don't expect for this to be a packed, feature-rich update that brings a host of improvements, since a "Wi-Fi connectivity improvement" seems to be the only thing listed in the changelog and nothing else. Users who buy either the Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL from Verizon will be prompted immediately to install the newest software update. While it's a minor pet peeve for users who expect their newly purchased phone to be completely functional out of the box, it's not entirely new for Google, as some Nexus devices have needed software updates in the past, right after unboxing. It's a slight inconvenience, but a necessary one for Google to make sure that all their handsets are up and running without any snags. It gives it leeway to tidy the devices up with finishing touches before their eventual mass distribution. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are Google's newest flagship smartphones dropping the name of its manufacturer, HTC. Google is intent on marketing this as its own brand of smartphones, beefing it with high-end specifications that directly take on Apple's iPhone 7. It runs on Android 7.1 Nougat, Google's most recent software. It sports a custom Android UI that includes the first full-fledged Google Assistant integration, acting as a standalone, system-wide feature, as opposed to Google Assistant only nesting on Google Allo on other handsets. The Pixel boasts a 5-inch 1080p AMOLED display with 441 ppi. Google claims that the Pixel and Pixel XL has the "best camera on a smartphone ever." On the back of the device is a fingerprint scanner and a 12.3-megapixel camera that can record 4K video at 30 fps, 1080p video at 30/60/120 fps and 720p video at 240 fps. For selfies and video calls, it houses an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. For those of you who'll get the new Google-branded smartphones, make sure that you are connected to a strong Wi-Fi network, or if not available, a strong Verizon wireless connection, in order to avoid disrupting the update. It also pays to make sure that the battery on your Google Pixel or Pixel XL is fully charged before you hit download. If you want to buy a 128 GB Pixel XL from Verizon then you're out of luck, since the device is currently sold out. All other models, however, are still in stock.

Now that a lot of users have the new smartphones in their hands, many are now wondering how long will Google provide the handsets with Android version updates. To make it clear to everyone, Google recently updated the support page for Nexus devices stating that both the Pixel and Pixel XL will have updates until October 2018. “Pixel phones get Android version updates for at least 2 years from when the device became available on the Google store,” the company wrote. “After 2 years, we can’t guarantee additional updates.” The company also clarified that the Pixels phones will get security patches until October 2019. One of the many reasons why a lot of people bought Google’s Nexus handsets was because they always got timely security updates and were guaranteed to have more or less than two years of Android upgrades. For example, the 2013 Nexus 5 is only upgradable to 2015’s Marshmallow update, as pointed out by Android Police. This is a big advantage over other OEMs that are still struggling to make sure that updates and upgrades are made available as soon as Google pushes them out. Related Stories Google's Unplugged Web TV Service Gets CBS Onboard Pixel, Pixel XL Review Roundup: The Pros And Cons Luckily, Google isn’t ditching that tradition for the Pixel phones, and it will surely put a lot of users who prioritize upgradability at ease. Although Google said that it can’t guarantee Android upgrades after two years, there’s still a possibility that a major update will still be released for the Pixel phones. The company did say “at least 2 years,” which suggests a possibility of that happening. With that in mind, Google currently release a new version of Android once a year, so Pixel users should expect at least two major software upgrades. The Pixel phones are currently running Android 7.1 Nougat, and the handsets are eligible for Android 8 “O” for next year and Android 9 “P” in 2018.

﻿ Google's travel push forces change in online space - TTG Asia - Leader in Hotel, Airlines, Tourism and Travel Trade News   Tuesday . November 15 . 2016 | HOME | ABOUT US | TTG TRAVEL AWARDS | MEDIA KITS | SUBSCRIBE           Daily News Archives Adam Tan Trade Calendar Blogs TTG Publications TTG ASIA this week TTG Asia Luxury   Home > Daily News Archives Share | Google's travel push forces change in online space Dannon Har, reporting from ITB Asia, Singapore, October 21, 2016   As Google expands its ever-increasing suite of travel products, the prospects of the Internet giant encroaching deeper into the online travel space has become a growing area of concern for industry players.   Google already boasts a bevy of travel products including metasearch tools Google Flights and Google Hotels, and most recently launched itinerary planning app Google Trips. It is now rolling out Google Assistant on Allo, its own chat app, and on its Google Pixel smartphones released earlier this week.    Eric Zimmerman, director for Google Travel   Observers think that the rising travel ambitions of Google will put it in direct competition with metasearch engines, which will be forced to transform in order to survive. OTAs, on the other hand, having spent billions of advertising dollars annually with Google and sell travel products, are less likely to have their positions jeopardised.   When asked what the near future holds for travel metasearchers during the WIT 2016 roundtable earlier this week, HotelsCombined CEO Hichame Assi said he would be watching Google closely to decide the next course of action while Qunar co-founder Fritz Demopoulos said he expects more vertical integration to happen until OTAs and metas become indistinguishable from each other.   This echos the findings from a recent Amadeus-commissioned study by the London School of Economics and Political Science that cites this as the nascent beginning of the “mega meta-OTAs”. These entities will come into existence as they are allowed greater negotiating power in relation with suppliers even as Google gains greater foothold in the industry.   Already, most major metasearchers are owned by OTA conglomerates such as Kayak under The Priceline Group, Qunar under Ctrip and Trivago under Expedia.   Holger Taubmann, senior vice president distribution at Amadeus, is expecting “rapid and large-scale changes” to take place in the mega meta-OTA scene, as the consumer expectations of a younger tech-savvy generation spill over into the travel distribution space.   This doesn’t mean Google is overtaking the entire travel booking chain. Guillaume de Marcillac, co-CEO of Fastbooking, which provides hotel channel management solutions, is convinced Google will come out a winner but will not become an OTA.   “What Google doesn’t have is the ability to source for suppliers in a highly fragmented market such as with independent hotels, which accounts for two-thirds of all hotel rooms,” he said. “What they love is to work with big OTA partners to simplify the connectivity.”   Fastbooking, which uses Google as one of its distribution partners, is seeing growth of Google Flights and Hotels “exploding” in the past 18 months, added Marcillac. “I can confirm Google is the fastest growing, but they also start from a lower base. Internationally, the biggest metasearcher for hotels in terms of absolute volume is still TripAdvisor.”   Google is currently in full product innovation mode, said Eric Zimmerman, director for Google Travel, during a Q&A session at WIT. He points to artificial intelligence technologies as trends that travel industry stakeholders should keep watch on and that will become a reality in a significant way in the near future.   Speaking to TTG Asia on the sidelines of ITB Asia, Jenn Villalobos, head of travel & hospitality Asia-Pacific at Google, states that it is not Google’s plan to become an online booking portal but a travel search player aimed at “levelling the playing field”.   Zimmerman also assuages worries brought up by OTAs, adding that Google is “very focused on a wide gamut of travel problems (but) we don’t want to be in the OTA business. There are many great OTAs and suppliers out there and we are not the right entity (to do that)”.   He reiterated that Google is only interested in the experience of consumers and will not bother about the backend of travel, the only caveat being “it’s very hard to predict the future”.

While we’re still waiting for word on some of Google’s more “unique” products, like the Google Home and Google Wi-Fi, Google fans can already put in an order for the Daydream View VR headset and the extra large but also extra capable Chromecast Ultra. That said, you might have to wait for a few weeks before you actually get your hands on either or both. Especially if they go out of stock immediately. No smartphone is an island. Even something as self-sufficient and intelligent as the Google Pixel will need an army of friends. At its October event, Google introduced some of those, including the much awaited first Daydream headset. The Daydream View is, admittedly, a rather odd virtual reality headset, straddling the line between a geeky device and a fashionable accessory, with its fabric-inspired cover and colors. While technically compatible with any “Daydream Compatible” smartphone, of which there are already one or two, the Daydream View is really more geared towards the Google Pixel, especially in size and in automatic setup. Others will probably just have to wait for third-party Daydream headsets. The Chromecast Ultra, of course, works with any device, Pixel or otherwise. The Ultra is a step up from the previous model, in size, features, and, naturally, price. Still bearing the same puck shape, the Chromecast Ultra now boasts of 4K compatibility as well as HDR streaming. Given those features, the Chromecast Ultra does cost extra at $69. The Daydream View, on the other hand, goes for $79. While both are now available for purchase, shipping is noted to take a few weeks. That is, if supplies don’t run out quickly like the Pixel.

Some have touched on this subject, but I think I need to make it perfectly clear. The Google Pixel is the least frustrating Android phone ever. That’s something the Android community has devalued over the years in an obsession over raw specs, and it’s something that the iPhone — forgive my comparison — has quite frankly dominated in. That is, until now… It’s just a whole new ball game with the Pixel. I mentioned this somewhat in my review, but at that point I don’t think I had been using the phone long enough to really see how it’s different from phones like the Nexus 6P or the Galaxy S7. I think “stock” Android has always been better in the realm of ease of use and consistency, but the Pixel is a whole other story. It just becomes more and more clear the more I use the phone that Google really did make an attempt to optimize the software for the hardware. And I touched on this in my review, saying that the UI is one of the best on an Android phone this year, and that the phone is special because it has a great top-to-bottom user experience. What I wasn’t able to see was just how much better it is. So far, I don’t think the Pixel has failed me. I haven’t been frustrated at confusing design decisions. I haven’t needed to restart the phone for any reason. I haven’t noticed any lag when multitasking (at all). I haven’t had any random delays when opening apps. I haven’t needed to force quit apps. These are all commonplace on Android phones. Today after using my Google Pixel all day, I turned on my Galaxy S7 edge and brought it out to dinner with me. That was when it hit me how much I’ve been just accepting as normal. The phone had been on for 20 minutes, and I unlocked it, cleared a few notifications, and tapped the home button. I scrolled over a page and tapped on the Twitter app, and it hung for a solid 5 seconds before even opening. It eventually opened, yeah, and after I closed it and opened it back up there wasn’t a problem. But it was frustrating. I don’t know why this happened. I’ve read theories about similar problems suggesting that many Android phones just don’t completely wake up from sleep correctly. Some people have just told me that my problems and performance inconsistencies are just bugs that will eventually be solved with software updates. But if I can’t even type in my password after waking half my Android phones from sleep, I think there’s a bigger problem. Like I said, it’s not every time, but these weird glitches and lags are constant enough that I’ve noticed a difference with the Pixel. Again, I’ve noticed this kind of thing for years on almost all of my Android phones — even Nexus devices with “pure” Android software. It’s not as obvious when all of your phones do it randomly on occasion, but one good way to understand this isn’t normal is just to pick up a friends iPhone 6S or 7 and tap around and realize how the phone doesn’t feel completely overwhelmed by something as simple as switching between apps. It’s something that iPhone users mostly take for granted, and it’s time for Android users to, as well. The great thing is that this realization is now happening for me with the Pixel. I feel like I can’t use another Android phone now. I’ve been using it for over a week now, and I can fully say now without a shadow of a doubt — whether it be due to the Snapdragon 821 or software optimizations or both or something else entirely — that the Google Pixel is by far the most consistent and performant Android phone I’ve ever used. Maybe not in raw SoC speed, but in practical use. And while I may not have articulated this perfectly in my review, it seems that others feel the same. David Pierce over at Wired mentioned it in the opening of his review, and I couldn’t agree with him more: I love Android. But the phones can be… frustrating. Clever features too often seem overwrought or poorly designed, or they’re buried beneath 15 Verizon apps on the homescreen. The iPhone is the Default Phone, the one you buy when you want a phone, not a project. The Google Pixel changes that. Another David, the Ruddock one over at Android Police, succinctly expanded on this idea in his review: But it’s that one time you go to bring up Maps and it’s out of memory on your Galaxy S7 and it takes like 10 seconds to load up but you really need to get directions somewhere because you’re stopped at a light and you have to decide if you’re going left or right ahead. When it’s crunch time, the Pixel always seems to maintain its composure and get you where need to go. In short? It feels a bit more like an iPhone. Walt Mossberg, writing for The Verge, had similar things to say: The Pixel is easily the best Android phone I’ve ever tested, and seems to hail from a different planet than the chunky, clumsy and pokey 2008 G1 which introduced Android to the world. Now, don’t get me wrong. This is not to say that all of the non-Pixel Android phones are all bad. They’re not. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, which I just so happened to criticize heavily in this article, was consistently reviewed as one of the best Android phones of this year. And I still think it is. It’s “snappy,” as they say, and it gets the job done. And Samsung’s TouchWiz isn’t the worst Android skin out there. Those phones aren’t bad; they just now have a competitor straight from the maker of Android that makes an Android phone as good as it should be. I frankly thought the headline I used in my review was going to be too sensationalist. I thought calling the Pixel “one of the best phones ever” would be too generous considering its uninspired and bland hardware design, not-yet-revolutionary software, and really really high price. But I’m realizing more and more that the Pixel doesn’t need to be the best value on paper or have the best specs or beat the iPhone in benchmarks. It’s about whether normal, non-technologically-savvy people would find the product to be a joy to use. And I think the answer with the Pixel is yes.

LeEco heralded its entrance into the US market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a seven-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple Inc's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. The company is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov 2 in LeEco's online store, LeWeb.com. The company is also selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the US with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors Inc. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China.'' LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem,'' is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing US consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us,'' LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of US users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users.'' Innovation in the US has hit a "bottleneck,'' making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with the Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. "The company is using the devices as Trojan horses, to deliver its digital services,'' said Gartner Inc analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidising hardware with ulterior motives.'' "Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service,'' he noted, though that device "is being sold at a premium price.'' Amazon.com Inc's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. Research firm Strategy Analytics Inc projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June.

University of California Santa Barbara doctor Giovanni Vigna landed Google's Security, Privacy and Anti-Abuse award for his long line of research into malware detection. Google did not specify the specific work for which he was awarded but Dr. Vigna has co-published dozens of papers in the field among some 200 works spanning Android, networking, and web-based attacks. This year he and a team of colleagues from his university and Northeastern University detailed in the TriggerScope: Towards Detecting Logic Bombs in Android Applications [PDF] how to detect malware logic bombs on Android platforms. Logic bombs are a complex and highly obscure mechanism to compromise devices and are favoured by well-resourced advanced attackers, including nation-state actors. The team produced a prototype platform, named Gerscope, that can identify all tested hitherto hidden logic bombs in a first of its kind work that outpaced all current existing static and dynamic analysis tooling. Paper authors Dr. Vigna and co-authors Dr. Christopher Kruegel, and Dr. Engin Kirda run security research house International Security Lab where a laundry list of academic security work has been published, and have founded anti-malware firm LastLine. University of California Santa Barbara Dr. Giovanni Vigna Dr Vigna says Silicon Valley culture is unhelpfully relaxed about security and therefore ships insecure code. “There is a different bar that is set in academics that lends itself particularly well in the cybersecurity industry,” Dr Vigna says. “In Silicon Valley, there is this concept of shipping a product which it is good enough. In academia, the focus is on novel ideas. "Only through innovation one can stay ahead of the ever-changing threat landscape." A recent feather in Dr Vigna's cap came with the third place ranking in the highly-complex DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge held at the DEF CON hacking confab August. Mechanical Phish flow. Vigna's Shellphish team, which counts hackers in the US, France, China, Brazil, and Senegal among its number, tried for the DARPA Grand Challenge prize by creating an automated vulnerability discovery and remediation intelligence platform.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday November 15, 2016 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Pixel shows Google is ready to make products for the mass market Eric Ravenscraft 21 Oct 2016, 10:37 a.m. Nexus devices were for Android enthusiasts, but Google doesn't need to cater to them anymore. The Pixels are phones for everybody. Pixel shows Google is ready to make products for the mass market Google's Pixel phones feature 24/7 support built in. The Pixel and Pixel XL are available in 'Very Silver' and 'Quite Black'. Photo: Google Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit The reviews are in and most agree, Google's new Pixel phones are awesome. They also mark the death of the Nexus line. With the shift towards Pixels, Google is turning its eye from the experimental world of Nexus devices, to the bigger world of phone buyers everywhere. Nexus devices were Google's hardware testing ground Ever since Google released the Nexus One in 2010, the company has launched a new Nexus device each year to coincide with a new version of Android. That phone (or occasionally tablet) would serve as the reference point for Android development. If you wrote apps or built phones, this was the device that you'd base your work on and branch out from there. None of those things, however, matter to most people who actually buy phones. Everyday consumers don't need their phones to have unlocked bootloaders, to be easily rootable, and to be a development reference point. Instead, Nexuses were for niche groups: developers, manufacturers, and enthusiasts. This distinction showed in a few areas. For starters, Google never really wanted the Nexus to be a top seller. Even if they were better and cheaper than the competition, Google rarely advertised directly, letting enthusiasts do the selling for them. Most people would be hard-pressed to recall any specific ads for a Nexus phone, but who can forget Samsung's long-running campaign poking fun at iPhone lines? Customers could also walk into every single major carrier store and buy an iPhone since 2011, or the newest Galaxy phone since 2012. While the last Nexus generation worked on every carrier, you couldn't buy it in any carrier stores. If Google's top priority was selling as many units as possible, these were pretty big oversights. Instead, Google was focused on experimenting and developing Android as a platform. Since 2010, Google has released eight phones from five different manufacturers. Each time, a different company like Huawei, HTC, and Motorola were put into the spotlight, so customers could see their other products. Google made a really awesome, affordable Nexus 7 tablet that was easily one of Google's biggest sales hits ever, but there hasn't been a new one since 2013. Instead, Google let other companies like ASUS make cheap, small tablets. Meanwhile, Google focused on a hybrid tablet laptop that came out before Android even supported multiwindow apps. The goal of the Nexus program was to try out new hardware, see what works, and built that into Android itself, rather than to sell any one particular device to as many people as possible. In fact, Much of that experimentation is paying off with the Pixel phones. You might never have even heard of the Nexus Q, but it helped bring you this.The Nexus program has always been a launchpad for Google. It let the company experiment with hardware that didn't already exist on the market, then hand it over to the rest of the industry to build on. It even allowed them to create whole new products. The Nexus Q was a colossal flop, but it eventually led to the wildly popular Chromecast. Nexuses were never about dominating the market. They were about giving Google a place to experiment. Google's Pixel phones finally offer the support the average customer needs From a hardware standpoint, the Pixel doesn't seem that much different from its recent Nexus predecessors. In fact, aside from spec bump and a couple new features, the Pixel and the Nexus 6P are almost the same phone. However, if you look at the criteria that made a Nexus a Nexus, they couldn't be more different. Over the last year, Google has slowly introduced new, consumer-friendly services that aim to support regular users and not just developers and Android enthusiasts. Most impressive of all, the Pixel has 24/7 support built right into the phone. Real support, too — not just a button to email a black hole somewhere, or links to community-run support forums, which is about all Google has offered in the way of support up until now. Just tap a button in Settings and you'll be connected with a Google agent by phone or chat who can help you with whatever problem you have. You can even share your screen so the agent can show you what to do. This is the kind of feature that's most helpful to the least technically-inclined users. Google also wants to make it easy for new users to transfer from an iPhone or any other Android handset. Inside the box, you'll find a USB-to-USB-C adaptor. Simply plug in your old phone and Google will take you through a three step process to transfer all your contacts, events, messages, photos, videos, and more to your new phone. Finally, Google is finally serious about advertising this thing. According to Reuters, the company has already spent millions on primetime television advertising with a lot more to come. This all ends with a phone that has the support and infrastructure regular consumers need, but also brings Google's hardware successes along for the ride. Google knows that enthusiasts and developers can tweak any phone — including the Pixel — to do what they want. Now, they want to bring in the people who just want a phone that works and someone to call when it doesn't. The Pixel phones are really nice, but it's OK to wait I've been using a Pixel XL as my daily driver for the last week, and I'm comfortable saying it's an excellent phone. It does everything my Nexus 6P does, but it's faster, the interface is smoother, and the camera is better. However, as an enthusiast who knows how to tweak his phone, there's very little here that I can't get on my Nexus 6P. I probably won't be buying a Pixel when my review unit goes back. If you're reading this, you might be in the same boat. It's a confusing place to be. For years, Google has catered to us because we were the loudest supporters in Android's early years. Those days are done, though. Android is huge and it's not going anywhere. Google can now choose to focus on other things. For millions of people who buy smartphones, $1000 isn't that expensive as long as they get the support that goes with it, and while it may seem expensive in comparison to the Nexus, it's on-par with other flagships from other manufacturers. It's roughly the same price that the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 start at. The Pixels are a mass market device with a mass market price and mass market support. This is also something of a first-generation product for Google. Yes, the company has made phones before (in partnerships with other manufacturers, and this phone is no different,) but this is the first time it's trying to provide a total customer service package for the average phone-buying public. There will be hiccups. Support will probably fail sometimes, and time will tell how well it will scale to thousands of users, or how good the support will actually be. There will probably be a much better piece of hardware next year after Google gets into the swing of designing phones on its own. If you want to wait, no one can blame you. However, this is the first time that Google's made a phone that it's ready to sell to the average consumer and actually has the support to back it up.

Google’s new “affiliate location extensions” are similar to existing location extensions, which are designed for businesses to attract in-store visitors with search ads. This new type of location extension is designed for manufacturers of products to send in-store traffic to third-party retailers. ”For example, if you’re an electronics manufacturer, you can use affiliate location extensions to help someone searching for a new TV find the nearest retail chains where they can buy your product.” Affiliate location extensions can be set up simply by choosing the new “Affiliate location extensions” option in the Ad extensions tab. The only other information you’ll need to provide are the retail chains where your products are sold, and Google says it will take care of setting up the rest. These extensions can be set up with or without a Google My Business account. Rolling out over the next few weeks, this new type of location extension comes at a time when manufacturers can drive more retail sales this holiday season. The latest 2016 consumer data shows those who conduct a local search on their phones visit the physical store within a day.

This week, the Googleverse continues that rise, with an announcement that Google Flights—the brand's flight search engine—will soon begin notifying fliers as to when airfares will expire. facebook dialog Pinterest Previously, Google Flights allowed users to see an airline’s fluctuating prices and a calendar of fares, and would also alert users of price drops or spikes. With this new feature, to be rolled out in "the coming weeks," the app will now notify you as to when that fare you're seeing will expire, so you'll know how much you stand to lose if you don't, say, book that one-way, $292 ticket to Amsterdam within eight hours. Though rival apps like Hopper and Hitlist also notify fliers of low fares and send price alerts, neither tell curious purchasers whether or not the ticket price they're seeing will be the same several hours from now, and whether that person has time to mull it over. (Neither do Kayak or Skyscanner.) The feature isn't infallible, of course, but Google's wealth of historical flight data at least helps to get us one step closer to the age-old question: When is the best time to buy airline tickets? __ Learn The Best Ways to Keep Your Skin Hydrated When You Travel__ Other notable upgrades: If you are tracking a destination instead of looking for a specific route, Google Flights will display tips on picking the best route—think recommended airports, cheaper dates, or tentative price increases. One level below that stage of planning, the app's integrated "Explore" tab lets users put in their month, region, and number of travelers, and will then spit out suggested destinations. Looking for a winter escape, and have your eye on the Caribbean for one week in December? Aruba is nonstop for $275, and Punta Cana rings in at $417. Google has also recently launched Google Trips, a mobile travel guide, and will soon add more features to its "hotel search" function. Stay tuned...

 Google's VR team is testing a prototype of a mystery wireless device Alexei Oreskovic Oct. 20, 2016, 9:02 PM 6,977 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google's recently launched Daydream VR headset. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider Google is testing a prototype wireless device that appears to be related to its virtual reality efforts, according to new documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday. Google is asking the FCC for permission to conduct nationwide testing of the mystery device with employees, contractors, and developers. The device transmits across a broad swath of wireless frequencies, from 2.4 GHz to 5.8 GHz, according to the documents. While Google redacted the details about what the device is and what it will be used for, the company listed Mike Jazayeri as one of the contacts on the filings. Jazayeri, who joined Google in 2005, is a director of product management on the leadership team for Google's virtual reality group, according to a LinkedIn profile. He was previously involved in Google's Cardboard VR viewer. Google recently began accepting preorders for its $79 Daydream VR headset, which customers should begin receiving in the next few weeks. The Daydream headset relies on a user's smartphone, which is inserted into the headset, to create a VR experience. But the mystery device referred to in the documents is still just a prototype that Google wants to begin testing and demonstrating. And unlike the Daydream, it appears to have built-in radios. One possibility is that the device could be Google's first all-in-one VR headset that doesn't require a smartphone, similar to Facebook's Oculus Rift headset. Google's Glass augmented reality headset also has built-in radios, but Google stopped selling the device to consumers in 2015, and it's unclear if the company will release a new version of it. Guessing game If you like to play fill-in-the-blanks, Google gives you this to work with: "The Device consists of a [REDACTED]. To enable [REDACTED], the Device also has a [REDACTED]. Consistent with [REDACTED], the [REDACTED] in the Device will enable [REDACTED], as needed." Apparently the device exceeded certain FCC limits in two frequencies during "unintentional radiated emission tests," Google noted in the filing. While Google says the prototypes are not intended for use by the general public, that doesn't mean the final version won't be a consumer product. Virtual reality and augmented reality, in which digital images are superimposed over the real world, are among the hottest technologies that are attracting investments from the likes of Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Google. Facebook began shipping the Oculus Rift VR headset in March, two years after acquiring Oculus for $2 billion. And Google has made it clear that it sees VR as an important part of its future. Interestingly, the FCC responded to Google on Thursday, seemingly incredulous about the broad frequency listed in the filing. "Does the one device truly transmit across the entire 2.4-5.8 GHz band? If not, this band should be broken up into sub-bands in which the device actually transmits," the FCC wrote in a letter to Google. Google did not immediately return requests for comment from Business Insider. Here are more details from the filings about Google's prototype testing: "The Device will be used by professional Google employees and contractors. The Device also may be used by external trusted professional developer [REDACTED]. The Device is not intended to be used by general public. No commercial operations will be conducted under the requested authorization, and all Devices will be collected or destroyed at the end of the experimentation period. "The proposed testing does not create a material risk of harmful interference. The Device meets all Part 15 Class A and nearly all Class B device limits for electromagnetic compatibility and radio operations. The Device exceeded Part 15 1 Class B device limits at two frequencies—43.4 MHz and 639.0 MHz—during unintentional radiated emission tests conducted by [REDACTED] at a distance of three meters."

(Associated Press) By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, Associated Press Published: October 20, 2016, 5:14 PM A   A SAN FRANCISCO — Most U.S. consumers haven’t heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple’s latest iPhone and Google’s Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco’s online store, LeMall.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package that ties into its origins as the “Netflix of China.” LeEco, which stands for “Happy Ecosystem,” is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. “America is the most important global market for us,” LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. “Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users.” Innovation in the U.S. has hit a “bottleneck,” making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that the company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as “Trojan horses,” to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. “This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives.” Google is similarly selling its Pixel phone in an effort to drive traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com’s Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company’s e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, Calif., with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, Calif., where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex “EcoWorld.” “They are not taking a half-baked approach,” Goertz said. “But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighbourhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple’s lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping yesterday in a direct challenge to Apple’s latest iPhones. “This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch,” Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. “We want people to come in and experience the products.” Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google’s freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular Wi-Fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company’s online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. People visit the new Google pop-up shop in the SoHo neighbourhood in New York October 21, 2016. — AFP pic‘Big battle’ A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company’s trademark colours. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed “experiences” such as smoothly accessing content or services. “I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores,” Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. “There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it’s going to be interesting to watch.” Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google’s side for now because he felt Apple was “playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence.” McLaughlin’s verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalisation has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world’s most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of US$53 billion (RM221.6 billion), double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Google to name and shame the web’s worst malware offenders Daydream View brings Google’s VR experience to five countries Google rolls out Chrome Canary experimental web browser to Android Google, automakers object to California rules for self-driving cars Intelligent personal assistants coming to the home (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Search Engine Marketing Internet Search Engines Search Engine News Search Engine Guide > Jayson DeMers > How to Learn SEO When You Know Absolutely Nothing About It How to Learn SEO When You Know Absolutely Nothing About It October 20, 2016 Comments Jayson DeMers Articles Tweet Search engine optimization (SEO) can be intimidating if you're a newbie. Even the concept -- making changes to your website to increase its visibility in search engines for specific keyword searches -- sounds complicated, and once you dig into the technical details, it all seems even harder to grasp. But in reality, SEO is much simpler than it appears on the surface. Almost every tactic you need to increase your rankings can be learned in a matter of weeks ... at least enough to get you going. All it takes is the certainty that you can learn this, the dedication to follow through, and a good starting point. So I've come up with the following six steps to master SEO even if you know nothing at the start. High-Level Basics First, keep these key and high-level basics in mind: The learning never stops. As with any entrepreneurial venture, you should recognize that you'll never learn everything. As Sam Ovens comments, you need to commit to an ongoing learning process if you want to keep making progress. SEO changes all the time, thanks to new technologies and search algorithms, so you want to stay on your toes if you hope to prosper. Scale your knowledge gradually. You aren't going to learn everything overnight, no matter how hard you work. So instead of trying to cram as much information into your brain as possible, focus on a small segment of SEO at a time. SEO is an ongoing experiment. Even if you had all the current knowledge in place, there's no guarantee that you'll succeed. You need to measure, analyze, and refine your efforts constantly to improve your approach on an ongoing basis. Phases of Learning With those precepts in mind, you can start to learn SEO over six key phases: 1. Get the 10,000-foot view. Start with the basics. Before you tackle anything with regard to SEO tactics, you need to grasp the strategy: what it isn't, how it's used, and how it can benefit your firm. Even if you believe you have a good idea, it's wise to check your assumptions: There are a number of misconceptions about SEO that might skew your approach if you start working under those premises. Moz has an excellent Beginner's Guide to SEO that's worth reading, even if you're already familiar with how SEO works. 2. Learn how Google works. Next, you'll want to get a feel for how Google works as a search engine ... but don't worry: you don't have to learn any programming. Instead, you'll want to learn how Google's algorithms evaluate the authority of domains and pages, how keyword contexts are determined, and the various Google updates that have altered the SEO game over the years. (High-level understanding is fine for most of these.) You can go straight to the source for this one: Google has a great interactive feature that explains the long and short of how Google search operates to index sites and calculate rankings. 3. Study keyword research and strategy. After that, you should learn how keyword research is performed -- as well as why it matters. Hummingbird has transformed the function of keywords within Google search over the past three years, but it's still worthwhile to include target keywords as part of your strategy. Backlinko has a detailed guide on this topic if you're completely unfamiliar with it, but try to experiment with lots of keyword research tools before you settle on the best one for your brand. 4. Understand how to measure and analyze your campaign. Before you start experimenting with the tactics that are intended to help you rank higher in searches, you need to know what you're looking for and how to gauge your success. In this phase, you'll become acquainted with the tools that can help you measure your progress, understand your effectiveness, and ultimately improve your results. Google Analytics is a nearly perfect tool for beginners, and Google offers a fantastic help guide that can walk you through it. 5. Delve into on-site SEO. Once those basics out of the way, you can start to work on the individual tactics and strategies that will make your site rank higher. First, you'll want to look into on-site optimization: all the technical changes, modifications, and best practices that you can apply to your website to make it more visible, better targeted to your demographic pool, and more authoritative. Quick Sprout has a guide with most of the information you'll need to start. 6. Learn off-site SEO tactics. Finally, you'll need to work on the off-site facet of SEO, which includes such tactics as link building and social media marketing. Even though this phase is our final one, it's one of the most powerful phases to master, because of its potential impact on your rank and the risk of costly errors are huge. If you're looking for a good place to start learning, Wordstream has a valuable guide on the subject. Once you're gone through these six steps, and learned as much as you can along the way, you should have all you need to start, strategize, and execute an effective SEO campaign. Again, there's never going to be an official end to the learning process, so keep reading SEO news sites and don't allow yourself to get too comfortable with any one strategy. The more time you spend in the industry, the stronger grasp you'll have on the ebb and flow of optimization.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In a story Oct. 19 about LeEco's entrance into the U.S. market, The Associated Press erroneously reported the address of the company's online store. It is LeMall.com, not LeWeb.com A corrected version of the story is below: China's LeEco sets out to shake up US consumer tech market Story continues below video × Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000.

LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation.

The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

In fact, unlike Nexus phones from Google, the new Pixel phones even managed to generate some interest outside the enthusiast crowd thanks to the recent cancellation of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. Android users are in search of a new star now that Samsung's most recent flagship phone is more than seven months old, and Google's first self-designed handsets could be just what the doctor ordered. Early reviews were mostly positive, though bloggers who didn't like the phones really didn't like them. Google Assistant is a bright spot and the Pixel's rear camera really shined as well, even managing to capture more impressive photos than Apple's iPhone 7 Plus in many cases. But a new test reveals that there's another key area where Google's new Pixel XL is no match for Apple's flagship phablet. DON'T MISS: These are the 2 best iPhone email apps in the world, and I can’t decide which to use There are a few features that always seem to be at the top of every list when consumers are surveyed about the things they consider most when buying a smartphone. Camera quality is absolutely near the top of the list each time, and the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus both have you covered in this important area. The #1 answer is almost always battery life though, and Apple's phablet beat the newest Google phone by a wide margin in one recent test. Mobile blog Phone Arena put both phablets through its standard battery test, which is intended to measure how long a smartphone battery lasts during continuous "typical" use. According to the site's tests, the new Google Pixel XL lasted for an admirable 7 hours and 19 minutes, one minute longer than Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge. But the iPhone 7 Plus ran for 9 hours and 5 minutes, crushing the Pixel phablet by nearly 2 hours. screen-shot-2016-10-20-at-3-03-27-pmMore Trending right now: Nintendo’s Switch is everything the Wii U should have been, but it might be too late These are the 2 best iPhone email apps in the world, and I can’t decide which to use If you have a black or jet black iPhone 7, you need these wallpapers See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump is already proving he has no idea what he is in for Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Online freedom hit by pressure on social media, apps AFP New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

The Amazon Echo is now smaller and more affordable than ever before. You can get one for $50 starting today from Amazon US, and available for £50 in the UK where the original Amazon Echo only launched last month. This is the second generation of the Echo Dot which took the original home speaker and left the smart listening mics that are found at the top. The only caveat was that you needed to use your own speaker. The new Echo Dot has its own speakers, gets rid of the rotary-style volume control at the top, and trims some of the fat as its even smaller than the original Echo Dot. The new Echo Dot is the most affordable way to buy into the smart/connected home ecosystem. If you already plan on getting a Philips bridge or smart thermostat, Amazon is offering bundles that can help you save, as well as a 6-pack bundle (buy-five, get-one-free for $250 or £250) if you want to have Alexa in every room of your house. Use the code: DOT6PACK during checkout. Amazon Echo Dot Gen 2 in Black or White The bundles can save you anywhere from $10 to $50: (US)Echo Dot + Bose SoundLink Mini II (Carbon or Pearl)  $214 (Save $35) (US)Echo Dot + Philips Hue Starter Kit - $100 (Save $20) (US)Echo Dot + TP-Link Smart Plug - $70 (Save $10) (US)Echo Dot + ecobee3 Smart Thermostat - $250 (Save $50) (UK)Echo Dot + Netatmo Thermostat - £149 (Save £41) Bundles with savings of $50 basically mean a free Amazon Echo Dot.

There were many more things outed that day, two of which are now finally available to order. We're talking about the Daydream View VR headset and the 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra. Both of these can now be ordered from the Google Store, while the Daydream View is also listed by Verizon. The carrier says it will ship by November 16, while Google is being more vague, putting its shipping estimate in the "2-3 weeks" region. Either way, it looks like both of these are set to become available at some point in mid-November. That goes for the US - elsewhere things are less clear. Remember, if you pre-ordered a Pixel, you're going to receive a Daydream View for free. To take advantage of this offer, look for an email from Google that will contain a code for your free VR headset.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise How to Choose The Right Keywords to Optimize For SEO October 17, 2016 SEO Jacob MillenOctober 17, 2016 845SHARES 3.5KREADS 845SHARES 3.5KREADS Jacob Millen 845SHARES 3.5KREADS Arguably the most important aspect of writing or editing an article with search engine optimization (SEO) in mind is choosing the best target keyword phrase. It can also be one of the trickiest strategies of content SEO to master. But if you choose the right keyword phrase for a given article and weave it into an engaging and well-written piece, your article could be well on its way to a page one ranking in search engines for that phrase. The target keyword phrase should be a two- to- four-word phrase (maybe even more words) that conveys the article’s core topic or message. While a given article might rank in search engines for a handful of different keyword phrases, the target phrase best conveys what the article is about and thus is emphasized more than other keyword phrases. If you could wish for your article to rank highly for any phrase, this would be it. Beyond the importance of shooting for a page-one ranking, there are at least three additional reasons why the target keyword phrase is so critical. It will make up a significant portion of your headline and meta title — usually the first part of your article a potential reader will see. It’s in those nanoseconds when you’re most likely to hook or miss a potential reader. The research you put into choosing the target keyword phrase can trickle down to the rest of the article. What you don’t choose for the main phrase can become secondary keyword phrases that will enrich the article’s deck, intro, subheads, etc., further enhancing the article’s clout in search engines’ indexes. Studying the keyword phrases people search for will make you a better writer and editor. Simply put, the research gives you insight into how your potential audience thinks about and looks for information. Below is a step-by-step look at how to choose the best target keyword phrase for an article, including a hypothetical example to illustrate the steps. There can be plenty of nuances to this setup depending on different situations, but the basic steps can be applied whether you are writing or editing and whether your article is an online-original or the digital version of your latest magazine piece. After you have a headline with a strong target keyword phrase, don’t consider your SEO work done. The best SEO isn’t just bolted on to an article or to the editorial workflow. What you learn via keyword research can be applied throughout the whole writing or editing process to improve the article’s readability and findability. The ultimate goal here isn’t to just please the search engines’ algorithms. It’s to make an article better for and more easily accessible by its potential audience. 1. Consider The Article What is its main topic? Not broadly, but specifically. What is its main reader benefit? What questions does it answer? Example: An article about the advantages and disadvantages of cork flooring — why it’s “green,” its pros and cons for different rooms in a house, different options of colors and textures, how much it costs, etc. 2. Brainstorm Your Keywords Before you go anywhere near a keyword research tool, ask yourself what you would search for if you wanted to find an article on this topic. Scribble down a few phrases of varying lengths, but nothing shorter than two words (more on that later). Example: cork flooring, cork flooring cost, is cork flooring green?, cork flooring uses, cork flooring options 3. Do Your Keyword Research My favorite resource for this step is the Google Keyword Planner. There are numerous keyword research tools out there with a variety of different options. Some of them are free; some are not. For me at least, it’s hard not to use the tool from the No. 1 search engine. When you open the (free) Google tool, start by entering the best phrase(s) from your brainstorm list in the “Word or Phrase” box. Leave the “Website” box blank, unless you want to limit the results to keywords that bring your website traffic. 4. Review The Results At the top of the results list, you’ll see the phrases you searched for. Below that will be related phrases. The columns to the right of the phrases show search volume and trends in different ways, and there are a few options to sort and customize the information. After you have your feet wet with this keyword tool, check out those customization options. But for now, I recommend focusing on the Global Monthly Searches column. Jot down the search volume numbers for the phrases you searched for and any of the related phrases that truly reflect what the article is about. Avoid phrases that aren’t natural language because they will be difficult to work into headlines and the text (more on that below). You may need to repeat steps three and four a couple of times to find good phrases, or you might find great options right away. Example: cork floors (90,500), cork flooring (74,000), cork flooring pros and cons (5,400), cork flooring prices (1,600), cork flooring cost (1,000) Even though you’re looking at bunches of numbers, don’t forget that those numbers represent real people using search engines to find the information your article might provide. If you’re unsure whether a particular phrase matches the article’s topic, or you’re looking at words that can mean different things in different contexts, Google the phrase. The results will show you what the search engine regards as relevant results for that phrase. Googling the phrase will also reveal the competition for that phrase (both who and how much). 5. Resist The Temptation of Big Numbers I know I said to focus on the Global Monthly Searches column, but don’t just run with the short and broad phrase that has the highest number of searches. Your odds of ranking on page one will be higher for a more specific phrase that gets less search activity. It’s far better to rank on page one for a phrase that gets a few thousand searches a month than to be on page 19 for a phrase that gets a few hundred thousand searches a month. The trick is to look at phrases that most accurately reflect what the article is most specifically about and then use the numbers to weigh the different options within that. There’s no magic number of search volume to choose or ignore. I’ve found that, for people who are new to SEO, choosing one phrase out of the options is the hardest part of optimizing content and that the temptation of big numbers is hard to resist. It’s really important to focus on the relevancy of the phrases and use the different search volume numbers more so as a tiebreaker than a compass. Example: In this case, all the phrases related to cork flooring are specific enough for consideration. But say the writer had turned in the article with a vague headline like “Great Flooring Option for Green Homes” or “Great Green Flooring Option.” “Flooring” (4 million) is way too broad and too big. “Green homes” (74,000) isn’t necessarily too big but is broader than the specific topic of the article. And “Green flooring” (6,600) isn’t specific. Say the author used a headline like “Why Cork Makes for Great Floors.” The problem with that is that it doesn’t really target any phrase. It doesn’t cover “cork floors” (90,500) because there are other words in between. 6. Choose The Long Tail After you have experience researching keyword phrases, if you still have trouble weighing the options and/or feel the temptation to choose vague phrases with super-high search volume, try this: You can get a sense of the ideal search volume for your topics and website by using Google Analytics. Look up the top entrance keywords for your website, then enter those phrases into the keyword tool. Then compare their search volume to the number of visitors they actually bring to your website. You might be surprised that some of the most continually productive entrance keywords for your website don’t have huge search volume. Enter the Long Tail theory. Whereas a shorter and more general phrase may have a much higher search volume than a longer and more specific phrase, the people searching for the latter are on a more focused and determined path. Generally speaking, when people search for short and broad phrases they are in early research mode and they’re likely to refine their search quickly to something more specific. When people search for a longer and more specific phrase, they are closer to making a “conversion,” which could be any or all of the following: read the article, share it on Facebook, sign up for your newsletter, subscribe to your magazine, etc. These days, ranking for long tail keywords is more important than ever. People are becoming increasingly savvy with using search engines at the same time as the amount of information those engines access continues to expand exponentially. On a related email exchange with Josh Loewen Co-founder at The Status Bureau, he mentioned that “Nearly 60 percent of search queries are for three words or more, and the fastest growth in number of searches is for six- to seven-word queries”. Example: “Cork flooring pros and cons” caught my eye from the beginning. It conveys the content of the article and speaks to an audience that knows about cork flooring, but needs to know if it’s right for them. And this phrase is especially advantageous with the next tip in mind. 7. Double Up If You Can Know that if you target a multiple-word phrase, you’ll also effectively target the words and phrases within that phrase. A win-win scenario is when a high-volume, broad phrase is verbatim in a longer and more specific keyword phrase. Example:  “Cork flooring pros and cons” effectively covers both that phrase and “cork flooring” (74,000) 8. Write The Headline Look at your short list of target keyword phrase options and write different headline options for the article. If you want the article to rank on page one for the phrase, odds are the phrase needs to be in the headline. Your best bet is to start the headline with the target keyword phrase. If that’s awkward, place the phrase as early in the headline as possible. A strong keyword phrase early in the headline will please the search engines’ algorithms. It also will hook the attention of quick-moving readers when they see the exact same phrase they searched for in a headline on a search results page. Keep in mind that your final headline needs to be clear and engaging, with natural language. The last thing you want is a franken-headline that makes the reader do mental acrobatics to understand it. Example: “Cork Flooring Pros and Cons” is pretty strong. Ideal headlines for SEO are a little longer (about six to 12 words), but I think adding another phrase to this headline would make it awkward. This example isn’t an especially challenging one, but it’s not uncommon for a headline to fall into place like this once you have a good target phrase. 9. Weave It In If you want an article to rank for a given phrase, it must be in the article. If it works naturally, use the target keyword phrase again in the deck and subheads of the article. If not, use secondary phrases. Definitely use the target phrase at least once within the article’s introduction. Then sprinkle it here and there throughout the piece. There’s no magic number for this — too little or too much will depend on the context of the article and what the search engine considers natural for that topic. Generally speaking, for a feature-length article, aim for at least three uses in the body copy: intro, middle and conclusion. But don’t force it. “The target keyword phrase should be a valuable phrase for the article, so using it a handful of times shouldn’t be awkward,” said to me Mariia Lvovych the founder of Getreviewed. “If you find yourself struggling to rewrite a sentence to get the phrase in there for the Xth time, stop” she continued. Example: It should be easy to use “cork flooring pros and cons” in the introduction and in the conclusion. But it may not be natural to use it more than that, which is fine. 10. Use Secondary Phrases Phrases from the cutting room floor are great for to use in the deck, subheads, body text, etc. You may even discover new ideas for related articles or sidebars. Example: Phrases such as “cork flooring durability,” “cork flooring installation,” “cork flooring prices” may naturally be in the body text and lend themselves to subheads. All of this may sound like a lot of steps, but with practice, you’ll find that the whole process generally moves swiftly and smoothly for most topics. Each time you do it, you’ll get faster, and you’ll learn something new. The payoff can be enormous — 15 to 30 minutes of work in choosing and applying a target keyword phrase can lead to thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, more people reading your hard work. Plus, you’ll become a better writer/editor because you will be all the more in touch with your audience.

Just wondering what other tools you might suggest for researching keyword volume, since Keyword Planner data may now be limited for some? Scooby Moz Keyword tool works well, but if you don’t pay for it, you are limited to a few uses a day. Scooby Unless Google Keyword Planner has changed since August, unless you spend a significant amount on Adwords, the data you get will be almost useless. It throttles data on low spending adwords accounts or free keyword research. Rahul Tripathi I totally agree with Point No 6 “Choose The Long Tail” because as my experience Long tail keywords throw we get ranking easily and also get more traffic. So as my opinion always select long tail keywords. By the way thanks for sharing this article. Deon Christie Excellent post, great read. Keywords are exactly where most newbies go wrong, and I agree with Rahul. Long Tail Keywords are not only great for ranking but is also the key to Buyer Traffic, the “Trick” is to offer something (That Actually Works). When someone types “crm software for small business”, then that is exactly what they are looking for, and most probably are interested in buying.

Startup That's Whipping Up Infographics for Thousands of Newspapers in the U.S. Graphiq has a growing database of more than 10 billion interactive charts and graphs. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT Graphiq, an artificial intelligence startup that specializes in creating interactive infographics, on Tuesday announced a partnership to distribute its charts through the Associated Press. Above, Graphiq CEO and founder Kevin O'Connor (left) and vice president Alex Rosenberg. CREDIT: Courtesy Company Advertisement The world's oldest newsgathering organization is getting a little help from a young tech startup to bring to life facts and figures for readers. The Associated Press and Graphiq, which specializes in using artificial intelligence to rapidly create interactive data-driven infographics, announced a new partnership Tuesday. Through the AP, Graphiq will distribute its library of more than 10 billion interactive charts and graphs (the company calls them "visualizations") to the wire service's thousands of news clients around the globe, the two companies told Inc. The partnership, whose financials were not disclosed, will make it easier for the AP to provide data infographics for its stories while exposing Graphiq to a worldwide user audience. "Today we're reaching hundreds of millions of readers a month, but the AP reaches half the world's population every day," Alex Rosenberg, Graphiq vice president, told Inc. Rosenberg noted that Graphiq will embed some of its staffers in AP newsrooms to be readily available throughout the news outlet's reporting process. "By partnering with them, we're really becoming a part of their reporting cadence and workflow, and we're getting access to a huge uplift in scale," said Rosenberg. Though it is nearly eight years old, Graphiq remains relatively unknown despite providing visualizations for major media players such as USA Today, Reuters, Forbes, CBS News, and NBC News. "We span everything from Zika virus to ISIS attacks to thousands of other subjects," said Kevin O'Connor, Graphiq CEO and founder. "Any kind of iteration of information that you want to dissect, we dynamically create visualizations on that on the fly." Before Graphiq, O'Connor was one of the entrepreneurs behind DoubleClick, the Google-owned network that is used by brands and marketers to purchase and place online ads. DoubleClick was a resounding success. O'Connor said he sees the same kind of potential for Graphiq. Thus far, Graphiq has raised $32 million over several rounds from various investors, including Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers and Pritzker Group. The company has not disclosed its valuation, but Graphiq is estimated to be worth between $100 million and $150 million, according to Zirra, a startup that uses A.I. tech to analyze the private tech market. "What we're working on today, people are going to realize it's extraordinarily strategic," O'Connor said. "You can see it happening with the Amazon Echo, Siri, Google Now. Rather than making people think like computers, we're making computers think like people." Until about a year ago, Graphiq had been known as FindTheBest and it specialized in so-called vertical search engines that could help you find information for any specific subjects of interest, similar to how Yelp shows you results for local shops and how Kayak helps you find travel information. After more and more reporters began using and embedding FindTheBest's visualizations into their stories, the company was prompted to formally launch a tool for journalists a year ago. The company changed its name to reflect this new strategy, and it also began reaching out to publishers to form partnerships to get its visualizations into more news stories. Among the first outlets Graphiq contacted was the AP. For the past year, Graphiq has worked with the AP's data team to help provide visualizations for a couple of stories every week, setting the foundation for the partnership, which was announced Tuesday. Now, the two will exponentially scale up the number of AP stories that come with Graphiq visualizations. The AP will also make Graphiq's entire visualization catalog--the company creates thousands of new visualizations each week--readily available to news wires' countless clients. This will make it easier for newsrooms to include graphics--which typically are time-consuming to create--with stories as news breaks. "What this means is we can turn [visualizations] around really quickly and deliver them to customers really fast as the story is still developing," said Brian Carovillano, vice president of U.S. news for the AP. The challenge, however, will be ensuring that Graphiq's visualizations provide the level of accuracy the AP's clients and readers have come to expect. If the company fails to deliver or embarrasses the wire service with corrections or falsehoods, it could turn out to be a major misstep for the small startup. "AP has pretty strict editorial standards around accuracy," Carovillano said. "We spent quite a bit of time with [Graphiq] just making sure that it met all those standards, and it's been really good." For now, though, Graphiq is focused on the AP and the vast, worldwide audience to which it has just been introduced. "If we can get a visualization or other media assets into a majority of news stories ... that's important," O'Connor said. "And the AP is a big part of the news."

With Google Flights, customers will never have to search for “the best day of the week to buy airline tickets” or wonder “how far in advance should I book my flights?” again. The travel app just released new features to help users who plan to travel this holiday season. Let’s start with Google Flights’ newest feature: Alerts that ensure you won’t pay sky-high ticket prices. 1. Enable notifications to alert you when prices are expected to change Google Flights/Screenshot Now after selecting a flight on the Google Flights app on your phone, a notification appears to alert you when the current fare is expected to expire.

If you’re still not ready to buy a ticket on the spot, don’t worry, you can set up a price alert to email you whenever prices are expected to change. 2. Find the cheapest day or month to fly Google Flights/Screenshot Most people don’t think to click on the actual calendar featured on the Google Flights homepage. But if you press the small calendar icon located in the top left corner, you’ll notice prices listed for any given day. This tool works to identify prices for both round trip and one way tickets. 3. Discover destinations based on your interests Google Flights/Screenshot This one’s for all of the indecisive travelers out there. If you want to plan a vacation, but aren’t sure where to go -- this is the feature for you. Under the explore tab, you can find ideas on destinations to visit based on your needs. For example, if you’re looking for an exotic destination for a honeymoon with good food for one week, you can click those icons and several recommendations pop up. It’s that easy. 4. Pick a random place on a map and find a price Google Flights Feeling spontaneous? But also want to stay within budget? You can quite literally pick out a random place on a map and Google Flights will give you an estimated price. Click the map that says “explore destinations,” then type in your current location and a region that you’d like to explore. For example, if you type in Europe, you’ll find dozens of red dots. Each red dot locates a popular city with transportation options. When you hover your mouse over the dot, a price will appear (see Dublin, $615). 5. Share your itinerary with friends and family members Google Flights/Screenshot It’s easy to get a second opinion on a potential vacation plan with Google Flights. Type in your location, set a destination with departure and return dates, select an airline and press “share this itinerary” located at the bottom of your screen under “track price.” You can send it to friends, family members and even yourself. Once you’re ready to book, you can click back into the link provided in the email to continue. 6. Find an ideal layover city Google Flights/Screenshot If you’re going to have a connecting flight, at least find a connecting flight in a city you may want to explore. This drop-down tool allows you to pick potential airports you’d like to connect to. Click on “more” and press the check mark for cities you wouldn’t mind connecting through. At the top, you can also adjust “duration.” Therefore, if you want to have a little extra time to explore a city, click “any duration” or adjust the hours to a time period that gives you enough time to take a little stroll around the city or grab a quick bite. 7. Focus on best flights Google Flights/Screenshot This best flights box is your best friend. When you enter all the information on your desired flight -- departure city, destination and preferred dates -- Google Flights will give you a summary of flights. At the top, you’ll see a box that says “best flights,” which lists 3 to 4 flights that will give you the most bang for your buck.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Verizon really wants you to trade your iPhone for a Google Pixel Brittany A. Roston - Oct 20, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit You can grab the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones from Verizon Wireless now, and you’ll get up to a $300 credit for your new phone. Only some phones are eligible for that $300 credit, of course, included among them being the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Samsung’s Galaxy S6, S6 edge, and S6 edge+, the Note 5, LG V10 or G4, and the HTC One M9. The Daydream VR headset is also available from the carrier. Google’s newly launched Pixel phones aren’t the cheapest on the market — you’ll pay about the same as you would for a new Galaxy phone, for example. The 32GB version of the Google Pixel retails for $649.99 USD, and Verizon is offering it with a $27.08 USD monthly device fee. The 128GB Pixel, meanwhile, costs $31.24 USD per month. Google Pixel XL Review: Android embodied, for better or worse If you’d rather the larger of the two phones, the Pixel XL, you’ll be paying $32.08 USD for the 32GB version and $36.24 USD per month for the 128GB version. The Pixel’s related VR headset, the Daydream View, is also available through Verizon for $79.99 USD. With it, you can use the Google handsets to view content akin to how the Gear VR works with Galaxy phones. The Pixel phones are available in three colors through Verizon: Really Blue, which is obviously the very blue version, Very Silver and Quite Black. The Pixel sports a 5-inch FHD 441ppi display, while the Pixel is larger at 5.5-inches with a 534ppi WQHD display. There’s a lot to like about the phones, all of which we’ve detailed extensively in our Google Pixel tag portal. Check out the timeline below for more!

SUBSCRIBE 13 uses for keyword research to help you win in the search engines Google may have shifted its focus from keywords to "entities" in recent years, but columnist Stoney deGeyter reminds us that keyword research is still an important and useful part of the SEO process. Stoney deGeyter on October 20, 2016 at 2:41 pm More Ever since Google rolled out Hummingbird in 2013, there has been some question about the value of keyword research. Moving from a keyword-focused process to a topic-focused process has led some to devalue the long, arduous process of keyword research. Many wonder if it’s even worth the time. After all, if Google no longer looks at keywords (Hummingbird), and people no longer search with keywords (voice search), we don’t need to research keywords, right? Wrong! As with most predictions of the death of anything related to web marketing — how’s that fork in guest blogging going? — more often than not, they turn out to be false. And in the case of keyword research, it turns out that it’s just as important today as it was in 2012. Maybe more so. No, I don’t have a keyword research tool to sell you. But I do want to make sure that you don’t take a pass on keyword research because you think it’s no longer relevant to today’s SEO. I could give you a dozen reasons why keyword research is still important. Oh look, I have! Plus one more for good measure. :) 1. Topical niche domination There is no better way to get a full handle on any topic you want to dominate than to perform keyword research on that topic. Whether you want to write one exhaustive article or a series of articles, keyword research will show you every possible nuance of information that searchers are interested in. Not only will keyword research help you write content for your products or services, but it will also give you plenty of ammunition for all your other content, such as blog posts, e-books, white papers, infographics and more. 2. Answering burning questions Part of dominating a topical niche is answering questions that searchers have. There are great sites such as Quora and Clarity, where people ask questions that need answers, and social media is also a good place to monitor. But people still ask questions to search engines, and that presents an opportunity for you to provide the answer. Due to low search volume, keyword phrases that are questions tend to get ignored. After all, you want to optimize where the money is! But don’t disregard these questions altogether. They can be the backbone of your blog content. 3. Making existing content more robust You can always improve your content, am I write? (See what I did there?) Using your keywords provides ample opportunity to improve existing content, whether it is optimized text, a blog post or something else. I’m not suggesting you rework your content just to add in more keywords for rankings. Instead, I’m saying you can use keywords to expand the depth and breadth of your content. Keywords can help you add in new information to keep content current or fill in some missing pieces that were not included and should be. Remember, frequently searched keywords change frequently. Words that didn’t show up in research a year ago might be popular today. Continuing to perform keyword research to update your content keeps you current and allows you not only to make your content more robust but also to keep it evergreen. 4. Learning your customers’ “language” Almost every business has a handle on the industry lingo. They know what their products and services are called, as well as the language used to refer to what they do. But what many businesses don’t have a handle on is the language used by those who are less familiar with the product or those outside the industry. Keyword research uncovers the nuances of product descriptions, and even the problems that are in need of a solution. When you only use your known industry lingo, you miss the opportunity to meet the needs (let alone get the attention of) the rest of the world that is in need of your solutions. Why? Because they are looking based on their understanding, not yours. Keyword research will let you see how potential customers view your product or service and write content that speaks the same language as them. This lessens the learning curve and keeps visitors more engaged with your solutions. 5. Improving your website’s navigation One of the first orders of business for many of the sites we work on is using keyword research to improve the site’s navigation. Not only do we use keywords to establish new pages of content based on what searchers need, but those very same keywords become the link text for the navigation options. This is just another step to learning — and using — your customer’s language to meet their needs. When visitors land on your site, having a navigation that uses the terms they searched helps them find the content they want. When they don’t see familiar words, you increase the amount of time it takes for visitors to get the information they are looking for, which can lead to site fatigue. Too much of that and visitors leave in search for easier grounds. 6. New product or service research When performing keyword research, it’s important you don’t stay so narrow that you only find keywords that are relevant for you today. By broadening your search a bit, you can uncover information that can help you expand your product or service offerings for a more robust business tomorrow. Years ago, I had a client that sold bags of all kinds. Our keyword research indicated that many searchers were also interested in laptop bags. This opened up a huge opportunity for new business that they were not already targeting (or at least targeting effectively). Keyword research can show you valuable new opportunities to offer products and services that you currently don’t have. That doesn’t mean you jump on those right away, but you can keep them in the back of your mind for when you’re ready to expand. 7. Finding high-volume opportunities When it comes to delivering traffic to your website, there is nothing more compelling than optimizing for frequently searched keywords. This is one of the metrics that gives keywords value. No sense optimizing for keywords no one is searching for, right? Optimizing for high-volume keywords gives you an opportunity to get a lot of traffic to your site, which can be a boon for business. Word of caution, though: Volume alone isn’t worth justifying the optimization of a phrase. You also have to look at the quality of traffic a keyword will deliver, among other things. But when the stars align, volume can be good. Really good! 8. Finding non-competitive long-tail opportunities On the flip side of that, sometimes there are some highly profitable opportunities with the less competitive (and usually lower-volume) phrases. I’m talking low rather than no volume here. As long as a phrase has a potential to deliver traffic, it’s worth considering for inclusion in your optimization campaign. Many times, these low-volume phrases are also very low on the competition scale, which can signal a big opportunity to create content where no one else has it. And that content can deliver rankings for which no one is currently competing. Optimize for enough of these low-competition phrases, and you may find that collectively, they deliver more traffic more quickly than the high-volume phrases. 9. Increasing click-throughs from SERPs Because keyword optimization is really all about creating content that uses the same language as your visitors, it’s important for you to use your keywords in a way that will entice visitors to click from the search results to your website. This is where title tag and meta description optimization comes in. Don’t optimize just for search engine rankings. Additionally, write enticing title and meta description tags that compel searchers to click your result over competitors who are also ranked on the same page of the search results. 10. Understanding the searcher’s needs Aside from getting the click from search results to your page, you also need to deliver searchers to the page that best fits the intent of their search. Keyword research can help with this. We often think of keyword research as the process of uncovering phrases, but it is also the process of understanding them. It can often prove useful to perform a search for your keywords and assess the results. Follow a few links and look at the content. If all the results show similar content, this gives you a good idea of what searchers are looking for. If the content varies significantly, then perhaps even Google doesn’t know what searchers want. When you can determine what information a specific searcher is looking for, you then have an opportunity to drive them to the… well, that’s my next point: 11. Delivering searchers to the most relevant pages Only when you know the searcher’s needs will you be able to send them to a page that meets it. Not every search for a similar keyword wants the same thing, so you have to make sure to have content based on the need for a particular phrase. Some searchers will be researching, some buying, some shopping and some just looking for how-tos. Each of these needs requires different content. By delivering the right content for the searcher, you will keep them engaged with your site and have the best chance of turning them into a customer. 12. Assessing your competition While keyword research itself doesn’t often give you any information on your competition, you can take your keywords and use them for competitive research. Use your keywords to find out what keywords your competitors are optimizing for or bidding on. There are plenty of third-party tools that will let you do that, or you can just plug them into the search results and see what you find. While knowledge itself doesn’t help you overcome the competition, it can be used to produce a strategy that will. 13. Establishing expectations of success One of the most important factors in creating an effective digital marketing strategy is setting the right expectations. Without knowing what to expect, in terms of what success looks like and when it will be achieved, there is simply no way to “win” at web marketing. Armed with the keyword knowledge that you get above, you can set some expectations and metrics for success. This can be important for keeping the right people happy and feeling good about how the campaign is going. So I hope I have wiped away all doubt you have had about the value of keyword research. By taking the time to invest in keyword research, you not only get a list of keywords to optimize, but you can get the information necessary to ensure a successful web marketing campaign.

The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighborhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple's lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. - 'Big battle' - A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed "experiences" such as smoothly accessing content or services. "I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores," Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. "There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it's going to be interesting to watch." Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google's side for now because he felt Apple was "playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence." McLaughlin's verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalization has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world's most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of $53 billion, double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs.

"I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores," Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. "There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it's going to be interesting to watch." Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google's side for now because he felt Apple was "playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence." McLaughlin's verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalization has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world's most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of $53 billion, double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs.

The company says it will be extending the preview to other devices ─ presumably the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 ─ in November, with the final public release to follow later that month. The company already showed off some of 7.1’s features when it announced its Pixel phones earlier this month. Some of the Pixels’ best features will remain exclusive to those new phones. Everyone else can look forward to App Shortcuts, support for circular home screen icons, image keyboards, and more. App shortcuts is Google’s answer to 3D Touch on Apple’s iOS devices, allowing you to long-press on an app icon from the luncher or app drawer, with a list of specific actions popping up so you can jump to a specific part of the app. Unlike 3D Touch on the iPhone, the long press trigger means there is no way to move an icon without first showing the shortcuts. Actions can also be dragged out as individual home screen icons for quicker access. For now only first party apps from Google support the functionality, but with the 7.1 Preview out developers can begin building and testing shortcuts in their own apps. Android 7.1 also features reworked Quick Settings that now shows a Settings shortcut and next to it a button that slides down the full panel. There’s also a support tab under settings, support for a double-twist gesture to switch in and out of selfie mode in Google Camera, the ability for keyboard apps to now feature stickers, animated GIFs and other images. If you have one of the supported devices and are enrolled to the Android Beta program, you should be receiving a notification to update at any moment.

The virtual-reality fad of the early ’90s created scores of breathless and goofy newscasts, one terrible Nintendo console called the Virtual Boy, and the cult classic film The Lawnmower Man, which taught us that mentally challenged landscapers could become super-geniuses with telepathic powers by playing video games and having sex in VR. But by Bill Clinton’s second term, VR was essentially dead, done in by high prices, marketing that overhyped and underdelivered, and the discovery that Lawnmower Man may have been playing a bit fast and loose about the scientific facts around VR and neural enhancement. Then, in 2011, an 18-year-old named Palmer Luckey hacked together what would eventually become the Oculus Rift VR headset. It attracted the attention of John Carmack, a cult figure in video games (he was lead programmer on Doom), who took Luckey’s duct-taped prototype to the computer gaming world’s biggest trade show, E3, in 2012, where it attracted a fair amount of attention in the gaming press. The Oculus Rift would raise over $2.4 million on Kickstarter, and was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. Now, with four other large companies pursuing similar technology and several more waiting in the wings, VR is on the verge of escaping the stigma of being a fad, instead becoming part of many people’s daily lives — and not just gamers. What great virtual reality provides is something VR designers call “presence”: the bone-deep feeling that no matter what your forebrain knows ("I’m wearing a goofy cyber-BDSM mask with a bunch of wires attached while waving plastic wands), it isn’t enough to dissuade the rest of you from believing in the reality of what you're seeing ("I’m 300 feet below the ocean surface and a huge blue whale just swam by and stared me in the eye"). It works on the basic part of the human brain that we’ve had for millions and millions of years, the one that yanks your hand away from something hot, bypassing rational thought and firing off neurons. It’s a feeling both wildly exhilarating and a little humbling — a reminder that below layers of abstract thought, we’re still just walking apes who will freak out if we see a bright light come at us from the corner of our eyes. It’s an experience unlike anything else available right now. If that pitch was enough to hook you, here are the six main ways you’ll be able to try out VR this year. Photo: Evan Amos Vanamo Media/Public Domain Google Cardboard ($15) In June of 2014, Google released Cardboard — a lightweight rig that lets you use your phone a bit like an old-school Viewmaster (or, if you want to go really old-school, stereoscopes from the late 1800s). To use Cardboard, you hold the device up to your face to watch various bits of movies or play rudimentary games — though because your hands are occupied, the only way to interact with the world is by looking at it. Google was mainly using the device as a way to get a simple form of VR into the hands of a lot of people (it did two separate giveaways with New York Times Sunday subscribers, and the sets were handed out at various trade shows like toothbrushes at the dentist’s office). Think of Cardboard as the Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station of VR — the basic concept is there, even if the tech is rudimentary. Who Should Buy It? Anyone with a smartphone who wants a glimpse of VR for the cost of a cheap meal on Seamless. Samsung Gear VR ($99) While Google was working with corrugated cardboard, Samsung was teaming up with Oculus to create the Samsung Gear VR, also released in 2014 (with at least one update since). Only compatible with Samsung phones, the Gear VR uses proprietary tech from Oculus to accommodate head pitch, yaw, and roll (essentially, all the ways you can move your head around). That solved a problem facing the Cardboard, which, when used with certain phones, began to get sloppy in its motion tracking. By limiting compatibility to specific phones, the Gear VR doesn’t suffer from this problem. If you have a recent Samsung phone (uh, besides the Note 7 — you don’t want to strap an explosive to your face), were intrigued by Samsung’s ad campaign, and don’t mind laying out $100, this is a great way to experience the basic promise of VR — especially since its virtual storefront offers hundreds of games and 3-D videos to check out. Who Should Buy It? Anyone with a Samsung Phone who wants the best VR experience you can get on a smartphone (at least for the next few weeks). Google Daydream View ($79) It’s a bit harder to judge this one, since I only got a ten-minute demo earlier this week. But what I saw was impressive. Besides undercutting the Samsung Gear VR on price, the Daydream seems to have figured out the head-movement problem that plagued the Cardboard — sweeping my head from side to side was lag-free and didn’t make my stomach lurch. Other nice touches include a softer fabric on the headset (important if you’re going to wear the thing for longer than 20 minutes) and the ability to comfortably wear glasses inside the unit. But the real secret weapon of the Daydream is its included controller. While the Gear VR has a optional control pad available for purchase, it looks a lot like an XBox or PlayStation controller. The Daydream's control pad works more like a laser pointer, with just a small trackpad and two buttons, and it allows users to point and move things around naturally. An XBox or PlayStation controller makes sense to anyone raised on Halo or Grand Theft Auto, but is unnatural to anyone who didn’t. Pointing your hand at something, however? That’s something we learn to do long before we even learn how to talk. The Daydream, out in early November, will work with any phone that is “Daydream certified,” which from what I can gather means extremely fast and high-end Android phones. At launch, the only two phones that will be able to use the Daydream will be the Pixel and the Pixel XL, though Motorola, Samsung, HTC, ZTE, Huawei, Xiaomi, Alcatel, Asus, LG, and HTC all have phones coming down the pike that will run Daydream. Who Should Buy It? Early adopters of Google’s new line of smartphones who don’t mind waiting a few weeks — or anyone interested in VR and and is in the market for a new high-end Android handset. The PlayStation VR ($399 for the headset or $499 for the headset, camera, and two PlayStation Move controllers, plus $355 if you don’t own a PS4 ) This is where VR starts to get really interesting (and really expensive). The Cardboard, Gear, and Daydream all lack something called “positional tracking” — while they can match your head movements as you swivel your neck around, nothing happens when you lean forward or backward, or get up and walk around (not recommended unless you’ve cleared out some room beforehand). Those basic VR headsets simply don’t know where you are in 3-D space — only what direction your head is pointed in. The PlayStation VR, along with its higher-end brethren below, allows you to move your entire body much more normally, and the PlayStation Move controllers — essentially wireless light-up glow sticks with a few buttons — enable users to point and grab and lift in a surprisingly intuitive manner. This device also benefits from having a major console manufacturer like Sony backing it: The launch list of games is impressive, and there’s a good pipeline of more interesting titles to come. While more expensive options exist, if you’re truly curious about VR, already have a PS4, and want to get the best experience possible for under a grand, this is the system to get. Who Should Buy It? Anyone with a PS4 lying around their house and any amount of curiosity about what VR can do. The Oculus Rift (The cost of a compatible PC plus $599 for the headset. Also budget $199 for the Oculus Touch controllers, which are out in early December.) The Rift, which jump-started the rebirth of VR, has had a rough go of it since its launch in early summer. First there were supply problems, preventing early Kickstarter backers from getting their promised Rift. Then the $599 headset only included an XBox controller, which is generally acknowledged as one of the poorer ways to move around in VR, while its (genuinely excellent) Oculus Touch controllers were delayed. Compounding all that is the stiff competition on the low end from the PlayStation VR and on the high end from the HTC Vive (below), and nothing in the Oculus game library can truly be called a killer app — that one game that can compel everyone to throw down at least a grand on the headset. That said, the Oculus has the deep pockets of Facebook behind it, its Oculus Touch controllers provide the best sense yet of giving you actual hands in virtual reality, and its decision to open up development on the Rift means even a small and dedicated team of devs could create something that makes the Oculus the top VR headset. Who Should Buy It? VR enthusiasts who want to support the company that made this revival possible and/or want access to Oculus Rift exclusives. The HTC Vive (The cost of a compatible PC plus $799 for the headset) If money were no object, I had a house large enough to dedicate a room to VR, and that room had a secure lock so no one could stumble in and see me waving my arms around at imaginary stuff, the HTC Vive would be the system I'd buy. The Vive has one major advantage over the Oculus and PSVR: You can actually walk around while using it, thanks to the two sensors set up in the high corners of your room. This ability to walk around freely and safely (the system will alert you if you're about to run into a wall) changes a lot of things. You find yourself crouching down to avoid incoming fire. You can walk slowly around a table, examining everything on there as closely as possible. In one memorable moment while playing Everest VR, I was asked to step out into empty air while on the edge of a cliff high in the Himalayas. While I knew I was just in a conference room in Chelsea, it took a tremendous amount of will to actually step out — and seeing myself floating thousands of feet up was so unsettling I quickly scampered back to “safe” ground. While the HTC’s controllers leave something to be desired — it feels more like you’re holding cheap kitchen utensils than using your hands — nothing I’ve used in VR has so completely wrapped me up in a fake world. It’s not the Holodeck, but it’s the closest thing we’re gonna have for a while. Who Should Buy It? Deep-pocketed tech geeks with a lot of extra square-footage who want to experience the best version of VR currently on the market. The Unknowns We are, for all intents and purposes, in the first generation of VR (let’s pretend that what happened with VR in the early ’90s didn't happen at all). Games are still trying to figure out simple thing like how to move players around with making them get motion sickness (something I’ve experienced a few times — and I’ve never been motion-sick in my life until using VR). Companies like Microsoft, Nintendo, and Apple all seem to be edging their way toward VR, and the price of hardware will drop while the headsets get better. Meanwhile, as mobile phones become more powerful and gain the ability to use position tracking, they may become the most popular VR platform out there. But the challenge for VR is that it’s isolating, and still a bit cumbersome. You have to pull on a headset, making you effectively blind to the world around you. You can play online with other people, but the actual physical experience, no matter how much your brain is being fooled, is you sitting or standing in a dark room, by yourself. How many people who aren’t already deeply in love with video games will really want to spend their free time this way? There is another option. This summer’s craze over Pokémon Go was partly because Pokémon is insanely popular, but also showed how powerful augmented reality (AR) games could be, because instead of isolating you away in a virtual world, it layered something extra on top of the world that already exists, and forced players to get outside and explore it. Upcoming technology like Microsoft’s Hololens (which is shockingly impressive to use in person) or the long-rumored Magic Leap could give people a way to play in virtual worlds while staying firmly planted in this real world. Is the future complete immersion in an escapist virtual reality? Or figuring out a way to inject the fantastic into our everyday lives?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us CBS first to sign up with Google for upcoming YouTube web TV service By R Padla - October 20, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google and CBS are teaming up to bring consumers content and entertainment thru the tech giant’s upcoming web TV service. No confirmation or announcement yet from Google or CBS but according to a source, CBS is the first ever TV network to join the new service that will be available on YouTube. It appears that the company is really serious with getting into our homes. It’s a web TV service that can be experienced right on YouTube. We’re expecting it to roll out early next year, changing the game of TV viewing as more channels are also expected to sign up with Google. Aside from CBS, there’s NBC Universal and Walt Disney Co. believed to be added to ‘Unplugged’–the rumored name of the service. The idea of ‘Unplugged’ is to target those people who don’t want to subscribe to traditional cable subscription and pay for channels they don’t really watch. This web service is expected to be affordable, will be ad-free, and will also include YouTube Red. This low-cost web TV service by Google will rival other online video platforms like Hulu and Sling TV and other web streaming services available. This could be the YouTube premium we’ve been waiting for. Of course, it will require some free but we’re hoping not too expensive. YouTube is still the top video sharing website today and it will only continue to be the go-to platform with the upcoming ‘UnPlugged’ web TV service. VIA: WSJ Story Timeline ABC, CBS and NBC blocking website access on Google TV CBS brings streaming app to Android, shows available as soon as 24 hours after airing More apps now Chromecast-ready, FOX NOW, HGTV, and CBS All Access included YouTube Red officially available in Australia and New Zealand YouTube Kids now integrated with YouTube Red TAGS Android CBS Google video streaming Youtube Must Read Google Home Review: Feeling at home with Google Assistant This is the Huawei Mate 9 and its Porsche Design twin Huawei Fit hands-on: fitness tracker in smartwatch clothing Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 136,403FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 469,000FollowersFollow 59,238SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2016 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

Google this week introduced a new data archiving option for enterprises as part of a broader refresh of its Cloud Storage Services. The announcements, at Google's NEXT user event in London this week, included new data life cycle management tools, price cuts and the addition of several new partners to the Google storage ecosystem. Coldline, the name for the company's new storage option, is aimed at businesses looking to archive rarely used data—or cold data—but still require quick, low-latency access to it when needed. Google is touting it as perfect for archiving years' worth of big data or multimedia content. The option is priced at $0.007 per gigabyte of data to store per month and an additional 5 cents per GB to retrieve. The company claims the pricing makes Coldline the most economic option available to companies for storing datasets that are accessed less than once a year. Google is offering a Cloud Storage Transfer service and a Switch and Save promotion for companies interested in migrating their archived data to Coldline storage. Depending on the type of data that is migrated, enterprises can become eligible to store potentially up to 100 petabytes of data for free for several months, Google Product Manager Kirill Tropin said announcing the new offering on the Google Cloud Platform blog this week. Along with Coldline, Google also announced changes to its existing storage options. Enterprises signed up for the company's Standard storage option within a regional location have been converted to a new Cloud Storage Regional service, which offers essentially the same storage features and capabilities but at a 23 percent lower price point. Google has positioned the option as ideal for enterprises looking to maintain their compute and storage resources within the same region. Like all of Google's storage services, the Regional option offers enterprises millisecond access times to stored data. The service is priced at 2 cents per GB of data and comes with a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee. In addition, Google has converted all customers using its existing Standard storage option across multiple regions to a new Multi-Regional storage class. Priced at 2.6 cents per GB of data, the multiregional option is the costliest of the cloud storage options that Google announced this week and is aimed at organizations looking for near continuous data availability across regions. "Regional closely addresses similar use-cases in terms of features, but at a much lower cost," a Google spokeswoman said. "Multi-Regional is generally a new offering class for us. By allowing customers to host in two plus regions, it offers more flexibility for use-cases like disaster recovery than Standard previously did," she said. The fourth storage option that enterprises now have is Google Nearline and is meant as a storage option for infrequently accessed data such as long-tail content and data backups. The Nearline option starts at 1 cent per GB. Google this week also announced a beta version of a data management capability that it said will make it easier for enterprises to use and manage different cloud storage options for different business needs. A life cycle policy feature supports automatic transition of data from one storage type to another based on the age of the data and the frequency with which it is accessed. In addition to the storage refreshes, Google this week announced several new partners whose technologies it said have been integrated with Google Cloud Storage. Among them are Veritas, Fastly, Cloudberry Lab, Komprise and Stor Reduce. The partners deliver a range of capabilities. Cludberry's Backup technology for instance will let organizations do real-time or scheduled data backup, encryption and restoration in Google's cloud storage environment. Similarly, Stor Reduce offers what it calls inline deduplication software for moving petabytes of data to Coldline.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Facebook Unveils Messenger Group Chat in Canada, Australia How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards YouTube Now Providing Support for High-Definition Video Cloud Native Computing Foundation Adds New Project, Grows Membership                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Featured Story: 10 Virtual Reality Apps to Get You Started with Google Cardboard Mobile VR News: Bringing the impossible worlds of our imagination to life. — Next Reality Hands-on: Google's Daydream View Feels Like a Hot & Stiff Pair of Sweatpants on Your Face Carib Guerra 3 weeks ago Hands-on: Google's Daydream View Feels Like a Hot & Stiff Pair of Sweatpants on Your Face While visiting the Made by Google pop-up shop in New York City this morning, I had a chance to try out the new Daydream View virtual reality headset. First impressions are important, and Google's new mobile VR product makes a good one. The headset is made of a soft fabric that most evokes a beloved old college sweater that's well worn but properly cared for. The demo only featured the Slate (darker gray) model, though customers will ultimately be able to choose from either Slate, Snow, and Crimson. By itself, the headset is lightweight and the added 5.93 oz of the Google Pixel XL, which runs the Daydream platform and provides the display, doesn't change much. Once the strap has been properly adjusted, the Daydream View fits snug on the wearer's head. My bespectacled coworker noted that it was the first VR headset she'd tried that was actually comfortable when worn over her glasses. The facepad—the inner mask-looking piece with eye holes and a nose dent—can be removed and is hand-washable. Stored within the front face of the headset is a simple remote controller used as the sole input method (aside from head tracking) for Daydream VR. The sleek oblong is small but stuffed with functionality in order to 'transform' as needed for whatever in-game uses developers come up with. Inside it packs a gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer for fine-tuned spacial tracking. The large circular concavity you see at the top of the controller is a touchpad and the whole face can be clicked like a mouse. Beneath the touchpad, are the "app" and "home" buttons. The volume controls are on the right side. During the limited demo I was able to experience the main menu and two games. The navigation is pretty straightforward. For the most part, your in-game experience will have a cursor that follows the controller's movements with a beam of light like a laser pointer. I found that the cursor would frequently move off center, forcing me to either list steadily to one side or recenter the entire experience with a jarring clip by holding down the "home" button. There were no headphones available at the demo, so the sound played through the Pixel XL's bottom (and only) speaker. That made it pretty much impossible to hear over the ambient noise and chatter of the event around me, and when I could hear it was obviously lopsided. Still, the level of immersion was downright impressive for a mobile VR experience. Limited, yes, but impressive nonetheless. The two games available were J.K. Rowling's "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," and a kid-centric collection of mini-games called "Wonderglade." While Fantastic Beasts was a superb showcase of Daydream's graphical and functional capabilities, Wonderglade made more use of the controller's in-game versatility. Image via PhoneArena One mini-game in Wonderglade was a digital version of those old wooden marble mazes where you have to adjust the board in order to navigate the marbles to their goal while avoiding holes. Here, the pitch and yaw of the controller affected the movement of the entire board. The Daydream View headset is comfortable. It is. But the material, soft and cozy and gray, imparts what can only be described as the feeling of having a pair of stiff sweatpants on your face. Plus, the phone heats up quick. So add to that image of stiff sweatpants a gently humming heating pad just inches away, and you'll have a close mental approximation of what it feels like to use the Daydream View for just a quick five minute virtual jaunt. After the demo, my face was all beaded up with sweat where the headset had been. [UPDATE: Responding to Tom's comment, I realized that I should note that the device used in the Daydream demo had been running for quite a while before I used it. Sweatface may not occur with moderate usage.] Don't Miss: Google's Daydream SDK Is Available Now—Here's How to Try It Out Overall, though, face sweat and brutal battery drainage really isn't such a high cost to pay for an honestly great VR experience—mobile or otherwise. The late-2016, two-punch combo of Google's Daydream and Playstation VR is going to make some serious headway in the march toward mass-adoption of VR and related technologies. For everything from its portability to its capability to its thoughtful design, I solidly vouch for the Daydream View. If you're on the fence and in New York City, go check it out.

How would you compare this to the Samsung Gear VR? As someone who wears glasses, and doesn't enjoy a sweaty face, the Gear VR has been quite good. I've been quite excited about Google's offering, especially with it being a fully integrated Android VR solution, rather than an add-on like the Occulus app, and it's nice to hear that it fits comfortably with glasses, but an overheated, sweaty face, means fogged glasses, and an unpleasant experience. That may very well be a deal breaker for me. Reply 1 Carib Guerra 3 weeks ago Hey Tom, thanks for reading! I don't wear glasses myself, so I can't speak to that side of things in comparing the two headsets. What I can say is that the Daydream View felt more like a finished product. The Gear VR has always felt like a bit of a stopgap to me, from the fit to the materials to the construction, it felt as though Samsung had said "good enough" and rushed it out to duly fill a hole in the market. The other thing I should note, and I probably should have said this in the post as well, is that the Pixel XL used in the demo yesterday had already been running for a while. Who knows how long. I was one of the first people in the popup, but I wasn't early in line for the Daydream demo. It's quite possible, even likely, that the device was running hot because of the extended use. TL;DR sweat-face may not result from normal usage. But if you plan on having that thing on your face for a couple of hours, bring a towel and sit in front of a big fan. Hope that helps!

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo News: The Made by Google Pop-Up Shop in NYC Is Like an Apple Store, but with Personality Carib Guerra 3 weeks ago The Made by Google Pop-Up Shop in NYC Is Like an Apple Store, but with Personality This morning, Google opened a pop-up showroom where anybody can visit to get a hands-on look at the new Made by Google hardware lineup. At 10 am the line at 96 Spring st, in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City, was growing but still manageable. Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks As we waited to be ushered in, Google representatives came by to offer us coffee drinks prepared by a pair of baristas in the Peddler Coffee cart parked on the curb. "Now that's latte art," said the guy in line next to me when he saw that the foam-topped drink that had just been delivered to him bore the new "G" logo (the baristas had a mocha-powder stencil). Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks He turned back to his friend and they continued weighing the pros and cons of the new Quite Blue Pixel phone. "I wish they'd made the front blue," said his line mate. The line proceeded in staggered waves for crowd control around the demos. It was a prudent move. The square footage of each demo area was no match for the number of feet pressing in. Skip the line and scroll through the gallery below to see what it was like. Images by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks The small rooms hosting demonstrations of "Ok Google" applications of the Google Home digital assistant were crowded out immediately, you can see one behind the "Google Home" pillar below: Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks On the other hand, nobody seemed very interested in the Google Photos showcase as presented by an unwieldy sphere of screens tucked into a claustrophobic alcove. Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks By far, the most popular item in the space was the Daydream View headset. Many guests ignored the rest of the exhibits and bee-lined over to get their first taste of Google's sophomore mobile VR experience as soon as they entered. The Daydream alcove was dressed up as the cartoonish digital forest that we first saw on stage at Google I/O 2016. Images by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks In person, the Daydream headset looks plush and snug. It's comfortable to wear (my coworker said it was the first VR headset she'd tried that felt cozy even over her glasses, true to a claim that Google made during their hardware keynote on October 4), but when I took it off after just a 5-10 minutes of use my face was beaded with sweat where the headset had sat. Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks The virtual reality experience inside the headset itself was impressive. For sure, it was the best mobile VR I've seen yet. The demo had two games to choose from, J.K. Rowling's "Fantastic Beasts (and Where to Find Them)", and "Wonder Glade" (a collection of simple games geared toward kids). Image via RoadToVR The graphics in Fantastic Beasts were top notch. The controls, a wand-shaped cursor that follows along as you move the physical Daydream remote, were easy to grasp. Unfortunately, the cursor frequently moved off center, forcing me to either list steadily to the left or recenter by holding down one of the buttons every few moments. I didn't have time to figure out if this was just me or some issue with the system. Overall I'd say the Daydream View is a huge win for mobile VR. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing what people build for the platform. Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks Nothing is available for purchase in the showroom, which is open daily from 10 AM to 8 PM through the end of 2016, but everyone is welcome to go try out Google's newest products. The company is also offering classes where you can reserve a time slot to learn about the Pixel phones from a certified Google guide in a small group of up to five people. According to the website there will be an event on Saturday, Oct. 29 where, "In celebration of National Cat Day, Made by Google will be hosting our furry celebrity friends—Nala and Luna Rose!" So feel free to do that, too.

Creative Commons Zero Ask people about Google’s relationship to open source, and many of them will point to Android and Chrome OS — both very successful operating systems and both based on Linux. Android, in particular, remains one of the biggest home runs in open source history. But, as Josh Simmons from Google’s Open Source Programs Office will tell you, Google also contributes a slew of useful open source tools and programs to the community each year. Now, Google has issued its very first “Open Source Report Card,” as announced by Simmons on the Google Open Source Blog. "We're sharing our first Open Source Report Card, highlighting our most popular projects, sharing a few statistics and detailing some of the projects we've released in 2016. We've open sourced over 20 million lines of code to date and you can find a listing of some of our best known project releases on our website," said Simmons. Open source projects emerge from all over Google, many of them produced through the company’s famous “80/20 directive” for employees, where they are advised to spend 80 percent of their time on Google-centric projects and 20 percent on their own creative projects. Google reports that its GitHub footprint includes more than 84 organizations and 3,499 repositories, 773 of which were created this year. Simmons has also rounded up Google’s most popular open source projects, as follows: Android -- A software stack for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware and key applications. Chromium - A project encompassing Chromium, the software behind Google Chrome, and Chromium OS, the software behind Google Chrome OSdc devices. Angular -- A web application framework for JavaScript and Dart focused on developer productivity, speed and testability. TensorFlow -- A library for numerical computation using data flow graphics with support for scalable machine learning across platforms from data centers to embedded devices. Go -- A statically typed and compiled programming language that is expressive, concise, clean and efficient. Kubernetes -- A system for automating deployment, operations and scaling of containerized applications now at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Polymer -- A lightweight library built on top of Web Components APIs for building encapsulated re-usable elements in web applications. Protobuf -- An extensible, language-neutral and platform-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data. Guava -- A set of Java core libraries that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, functional types, an in-memory cache, and APIs/utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, reflection, string processing and much more. Yeoman -- A robust and opinionated set of scaffolding tools including libraries and a workflow that can help developers quickly build beautiful and compelling web applications. Among recent open source contributions from Google, Kubernetes and TensorFlow are having particularly notable impact. Google’s Open Source Report Card also delves into the most popular languages that Googlers use. These are summarized in order, with open source strongly represented: JavaScript Java C/C++ Go Python TypeScript Dart PHP Objective-C C# The Open Source Report Card is not the only way to put metrics on Google’s open source activities. GitHub, in partnership with Google, has produced a new open dataset on Google BigQuery, a low-cost analytics data warehouse service in the cloud, so that anyone can get data-driven insights based on more than 2.8 million open source GitHub repositories. “Many things can be gleaned using the open source GitHub dataset on BigQuery,” Simmons notes, “like usage of tabs versus spaces and the most popular Go packages. What about how many times Googlers have committed to open source projects on GitHub? We can search for Google.com email addresses to get a baseline number of Googler commits.” “With this we learn that Googlers have made 142,527 commits to open source projects on GitHub since the start of the year. This dataset goes back to 2011 and we can tweak this query to find out that Googlers have made 719,012 commits since then. Again, this is just a baseline number as it doesn’t count commits made with other email addresses.” In recent months, Google also has open sourced other useful tools, many of them tested and hardened in-house. They include machine learning applications, 3D visualization tools, and more. In case you missed any of these, the Open Source Report Card highlights some of the most interesting examples. You can find expanded discussions of these projects at the bottom of the page here.

Automakers and Google raised a litany of concerns about California’s proposal at a hearing in Sacramento on Wednesday. They expressed opposition to the state proposal to require compliance with guidelines that federal regulators issued last month, but made voluntary. They questioned why California would require a new autonomous vehicle data recorder and what data they would be required to test, and they objected to a proposal they said would force a 12-month delay between testing a vehicle and deploying it on public roads. Automakers also questioned whether police should be able to get any self-driving data within 24 hours without seeking a warrant or subpoena. California regulatory policy is important to automakers and technology companies because of its impact on operations in the state, and because the policies enacted in the most populous U.S. state often influence what other states and other countries do. The proposed requirement that manufacturers generate a year of driverless testing data before applying for an operating permit drew objections from General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG, Honda Motor Co., Ford Motor Co., and Google. The state’s approach “could greatly delay the benefits that self-driving vehicles can bring to safety and mobility for individuals,” said David Strickland, who heads the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets that includes Google, Ford, Lyft, Uber Technologies Inc. and Volvo Car Group. Brian Soublet, deputy director of the California DMV, said Wednesday the department wants concrete suggestions to help improve its proposal. Soublet said the department will be considering potential changes over the next several months but he did not give a timetable for finalizing the rules. “The goal is making sure that we can get this life-saving technology out on the streets,” Soublet said. California’s proposal would allow for the absence of a human driver and a steering wheel in advanced self-driving cars. In December, California had proposed to require licensed drivers and controls in self-driving vehicles. Ron Medford, director of safety for Google’s self-driving car project, said California’s proposal to require manufacturers to obtain local approval is “unworkable.” The rule could prevent manufacturers from testing a vehicle that can travel from one area to another. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog urged California to prohibit autonomous vehicles without a human driver until federal regulators enact enforceable standards. (Reporting by Shepardson.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Android Pay stopped working on phones with unlocked bootloaders By R Padla - October 20, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Android Pay is one of the widely used mobile payment services today. It rivals Samsung Pay and Apple Pay but it has a bigger advantage because there are more Android devices combined all over the world compared to pure Samsung phones and iPhones. For those people who like to unlock their devices, know that Google is making changes by applying the SafetyNet system. This means if you use unlocked bootloaders and Android Pay, Google will not be able to verify your account. Google is preventing modifications that can be dangerous to devices that’s why it’s using SafetyNet to stop them. No official announcement from Google but Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P users have been complaining, saying a message prompt has appeared when trying to use Android Pay. A Redditor known as PhantomGamers said he received a “We could not verify your software” message. His device was running an unlocked bootloader. The same thing happened to another user who was running CyanogenMod 13 on a new OnePlus 3. One Nexus 6P user even received a longer note: “Android pay can’t be used on this device. Google isn’t able to confirm that your device or the software on it is is Android compatible. You many need to unroot your device.” This can be frustrating for some Android Pay users but it seems to be a reminder from Google for you to be wary of whatever modifications you are doing on your phone. If you happen to run on an unlocked bootloader and are a regular Android Pay user, you may encounter this error from now on.

Skip to content INFORMATION NIGERIA Nigeria's No.1 Information Portal Menu Home Trending Metro Entertainment Music Lifestyle Sports World Odd News Education Jobs When Voters Google ‘Donald Trump Iraq’: Here’s What They Found Google saw a surge in searches of the term “Donald Trump Iraq” during the third and final presidential debate yesterday, when Donald Trump once again denied that he supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003. His rival in the debate, Hillary Clinton wanted everyone to know that’s not the case and begged voters to Google ‘Donald Trump Iraq’ for fact-checking…and they listened. “Google it. You’ll see dozens of sources verifying that he supported the invasion of Iraq, and you can hear the audio of him saying it, the Democratic nominee said. The audio the former Secretary of State was referring to is from a 2002 interview Trump did with Howard Stern, six months before the Iraq invasion. When the radio show host asked Donald if he was in favor of the Iraq war, he responded, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.” Recommended for you Quilox Releases Statement on Oritsfemi Altercation 6 Pictures Of Barack Obama That’ll Leave You All Warm & Fuzzy Oritsefemi, Sound Sultan Trade Subs On Instagram Seven die in Ibadan accident Mikel Obi Denies He’s Being Punished By Conte Still, during yesterday’s debate, Donald continued to deny ever saying this. “I opposed going in,” he said. “And I did oppose it, despite the media saying no, yes, no.

By Jack Wallen | October 20, 2016, 11:52 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google Every so often you might find Google Drive on Android giving you fits. You want to work on a document saved to your Google Cloud, or a document saved to work on locally and it won't open. When those docs won't download or open, productivity can grind to a halt. You check your network connection, and it's good to go. You reboot your device, and the problem persists. What is going on? Why won't Google Drive behave? The problem lies in the Google Drive cache (that's right...cache strikes again). There are many times and various instances where a system, service, or app cache can cause a host of problems, and Google Drive is not immune. In the end, you just need the app to function so you can get back to work. With that said, let's solve this problem. SEE: Report: More than half of IT professionals think the cloud makes their jobs harder Clearing the Google Drive cache You might think clearing the entire app cache would solve this problem, but it doesn't always; besides, there may be instances when you don't want to clear the cache for all of your apps. Here's how to clear just the Google Drive cache. 1. Open the Google Drive app and then tap the menu button in the top left corner (three vertical bars). 2. When the sidebar opens (Figure A), scroll down and tap Settings. Figure A Image: Jack Wallen The Google Drive sidebar open on a OnePlus 3. 3. From within the Settings window, scroll down until you see Clear Cache (Figure B). Tap that button and then, when prompted, tap OK to remove all cached documents from within Google Drive. Figure B Image: Jack Wallen Clearing the cache on Google Drive. You should be able to, once again, work with Google Drive. You'll also see that all of your offline documents are still listed. As soon as you clear the cache, those offline documents will be automatically re-downloaded and made available to you. Clearing the Google Docs cache On the off chance that clearing the Google Drive cache doesn't resolve the issue, you might have to clear the cache on Google Docs as well. To do this, follow these steps. Open Google Docs on your mobile device. Tap the menu button in the upper left corner (three horizontal bars). Tap Settings. Scroll down and tap Clear Cache. When prompted, tap OK. Now go back to the document that won't open and try again. At this point, the file should be fine. It will happen When you're using the cloud (and who isn't?), you know errors are going to occur. In the case of Google Drive/Docs, the errors are rare, but when they happen, they can strike at the absolute worst times. Fortunately, the solution for solving the issue of docs not opening is quite simple: clear your cache, and all is right in the world. If things go wrong, you always have a backup via the web version of Google Drive. To be safe, make sure you employ a tool/service like Insync to keep a local copy of Google Drive on your desktop.

Kodak first introduced its Ektra camera to the masses in 1941. The new Ektra smartphone features several nods to past incarnations, complete with a textured finish and leather accessories for carrying the device. In addition, the device nods to its predecessors via a Super-8 app, which allows users to add touches that are akin to finishes seen on Super-8 videos of yesteryear. More on this... Google takes aim at Apple and Samsung with Pixel phones With Android on top of the world, Google is already working on a mysterious new OS Google’s vision for VR: Bringing high-end VR to the masses However, the inner workings of the device are decidedly modern. A HELIO X20 Decacore processor runs Android Marshmallow software. The device’s 21-megapixel camera sensor has f2.0 aperture and a 13-megapixel front-facing camera with phase detection autofocus and f2.2 aperture. Ektra’s camera app is controlled by a SLR-style scene selection dial, allowing users to adjust settings including landscape, sport, and night-time. The camera also has a smart auto mode, which auto-selects the condition. Kodak added that advanced users can put the Manual mode through its paces by adjusting exposure, ISO, focus, white balance and shutter speed. In a press release on Kodak’s website, Chief Executive Jeff Clarke said, “the launch of the KODAK Smartphone today demonstrates our ongoing commitment to bringing the latest advances in photography to consumers. [The EKTRA Smartphone] opens up a world of creative opportunities to all who care about photography.” The device will be available in Europe and retails for around $550, according to Kodak.

Whether it’s about billboards spread across major cities, videos or crazy print ads, the Mountain View firm is going all in. And so here we are, on launch day, with three just-released videos dedicated to the Phone by Google; but this time with a touch of YouTube celebrities… Unlike last time, where Google seemed to focus entirely on a “human” aspect (by essentially remaining radio silent about specs or features whatsoever), the three new clips are actually minute-long videos that focus entirely on one of the phone’s capabilities. We have one for the Assistant, one for the camera, and then a last one for Duo. Singer, actor, dancer, director, choreographer, and YouTuber Todrick Hall is up first, in its Assistant-driven journey towards designing and creating a new jacket with a hand from Google’s digital helper. The “Perfect Piece” sees Hall asking the assistant about photos, places nearby, as well as a series of everyday questions it hasn’t much trouble figuring out — all with a touch of humor. Alisha Marie’s glamping trip follows; and what best occasion to take advantage of the Pixel’s stunning 12MP shooter? The ad focuses on things such as the double-twist for selfie mode, the panorama feature, HDR+, 4K recording, EIS, low light capabilities, Lens Blur and the like. Of course, the “unlimited storage at full resolution” makes its appearance, too — and considering how great that is, I’d say it’s definitely a good thing to put in there. Connor Franta’s puppies bonanza closes the ad trifecta, with not much to show as Duo’s simplicity speaks for itself. Indeed, the Knock Knock feature is highlighted — as well as put in direct comparison with iOS’ rather dull notification — but it’s Franta’s relative popularity and the newborn dogs that somehow manage to lift the overall tone (whether you think it’s cringeworthy or not).

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. An article in Search Engine Land examines the way search engine optimization has changed over the past few years. In spite of rumors that SEO is dead, this columnist believes it has simply evolved. He points out that the way people approach SEO these days is very different and that the sort of cookie-cutter approach that used to work is now rarely successful in helping to push a site to the top of Google. What is different about SEO is that there is no real formula. While someone skilled can put best practices into use, increasing the likelihood of a good outcome, there are no guarantees. Of course, this has always been true and SEO practitioners who promise clients the Earth really should never have been trusted. The change to how SEO can affect a website’s ranking began back in 2011 with the introduction of Google Panda. Although in some ways it was easy to understand, in other ways the effects were very subtle. In order to introduce Panda, Google had collated ratings from humans on how they perceived the quality of the website, based on a set of questions. Machine learning algorithms were then applied to extend these opinions, leading to the development of Panda. In 2013 Google introduced Hummingbird, which took artificial intelligence to another level. For this introduction, the core search algorithm had undergone a major rewrite. Initially it appeared as if there was no real impact, but apparently, Hummingbird was able to affect 90% of all searches compared to Panda affecting just 12%. But the reason for this perhaps lies in the growing ability to be able to talk to machines using everyday language. This means the search engines like Google have to understand the intent behind the query, not merely the words. Last year Google released RankBrain, a machine particularly useful for long-tail queries and which introduces the concept of semantic search. Amazingly, 15% of search queries are completely new to Google. Thanks to semantic search, Google can understand an article more easily, which is shown when an article ranks for keywords that aren’t found anywhere in the article or in the anchor text. A recent study looked at 1 million Google search results and found title tag correlation, the connection between a particular keyword in the title tag and ranking for the search for that keyword is much smaller than expected. Whereas it used to be important to have an exact matching keyword or something close to it, now there isn’t such a need to be explicit with the keyword being targeted, thanks to Google gaining a better understanding of the context of the article. This may be why longer content is becoming preferable as it is more able to fully describe the topic and is more relevant. To read the complete article, please click here.

Comments Jeff says: October 25, 2016 at 8:14 pm SEO is always in a constant state of change. Ways to exploit the algorithm are found and then Google eventually closes the loopholes. It’s a cat and mouse game. Mohan raj says: October 21, 2016 at 5:09 pm From my knowledge people keep on saying SEO is dead from 2010 onwards. But SEO is going great , crafting perfect result pages for white hat sites. In future, it is going to be AI which gives users a perfect results. What do you say ?

Politics 1 0 0 October 20, 2016 ‘I Opposed Going In’: Trump Says Clinton Tells Americans To Google ‘Donald Trump Iraq’ What Did They Find? Tito Ojo-Medubi During Wednesday’s presidential debate, Donald Trump said he never supported the invasion of Iraq and Hillary Clinton told Americans to Google “Donald Trump Iraq.” Hillary Clinton revealed that Donald Trump continued to give the impression that he never supported the Iraqi war to score political points. According to the New York Times, Hillary Clinton told voters to fact-check the assertion that he supported the invasion right from the beginning by going to Google. “I just want everybody to go Google it. Google, ‘Donald Trump Iraq.’ And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq. And you will hear the audio of him saying it.” You don’t have to Google “Donald Trump – Iraq,” just click this https://t.co/xDHGpSWYBw — BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) October 20, 2016 After her comments, online searches spiked according to data from Google Trends. “Donald Trump Iraq” was a phrase searched more significantly than any other topic discussed by the two political rivals. This is not the first time that the invasion of Iraq would pose to be a contentious topic during the presidential debates. In the first debate in September, Trump revealed that he vehemently opposed the war. In the second debate, which was held in October, Hillary Clinton pointed out that the businessman-turned-politician had supported the war even before it began. Clinton asked debate viewers to Google "Donald Trump Iraq" last night. It worked: off the chart search trend compared to other hot topics. pic.twitter.com/ysJ6puJaZ1 — Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) October 20, 2016 The 68-year-old Democratic Party hopeful has pointed out several times that it is on record that Donald Trump supported the war. Hillary Clinton is referring to a 2002 interview Trump did with Howard Stern, six months before American forces launched a military offensive against Iraq. The radio show host had asked Trump if he was in support of the war and the New York businessman countered “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.” However, the 70-year-old has consistently denied that he supported the war since the debates started. “I opposed going in. And I did oppose it, despite the media saying no, yes, no. I opposed going in.” [Image by Mark Ralston/AP Images] Donald Trump has a confusing and lengthy history over his stance over the Iraq war. In one of his campaign rallies, he addressed his stance against the war referencing an August, 2004, Esquire article where he objected the war. In the interview, Trump had called the war a mess that was handled badly. “Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we’re in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box — and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? Two minutes after we leave, there’s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest most vicious guy will take over.” The editor of Esquire has since come out to say that Trump was misrepresenting the facts. [Image by Patrick Semansky/AP Images] In November 2004, Donald Trump, while on CNN’s Larry King Live, had reiterated that going into Iraq was a bad decision. Donald Trump has referenced these two periods as proof that he never, at any point, showed support for the Iraqi war, accusing the media of being dishonest and spinning a web of lies. Trump said the Howard Stern statement was the first time someone had asked him about the Iraq situation. He said he showed an initial support of the war because he did not have all the facts. However, when he had a stronger grasp of the issues, he gave subsequent statements why it was not right for America to invade the oil-rich nation. The 70-year-old said if he had been in congress at the advent of the invasion, he would have taken a stronger stand by casting a vote of opposition. Trump said he was a private citizen who had no access to briefings or covert intelligence files like his political rival, Hillary Clinton, and admitted that he backtracked on his initial stance when he got more information about the war.

Google is looking to offer a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month, according to media executives who have heard the pitch.” “Apple Inc. has explored putting together its own discounted online TV bundle, but ran into issues securing media rights on the terms it wanted,” Flint and Ramachandran report. “Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. 21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Well, at least somebody is capable of getting ink. It’s quite possible that without Steve Jobs’ help, Eddy Cue couldn’t get ink in a stationery store. Just kidding (sort of)! But, boy this is taking eons to accomplish, isn’t it? — MacDailyNews, November 5, 2015 As we wrote last December: “It’s 2015. This should’ve happened already. At this rate, America will back on the moon before Eddy Cue gets the contracts inked. So, before we’re dead, m’kay?” Apple’s Internet TV service, if it ever happens, would have to have ESPN. It will also likely require the “Big Four” networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) – although it could launch with three out of four and eventually hammer out a deal with whichever one is being the most reticent. That said, at this late date, Apple might as well wait until they have a full dance card. What else would you consider to be must-haves? Beyond the Big Four, if you go by primetime ratings (total viewers), the top 20 U.S. cable networks are: 1. ESPN 2. Fox News Channel 2. USA 3. TBS 4. Disney 5. Discovery Channel 6. History Channel 7.

Nothing to do with cost, Eddie or any other deficiency. Alphabet on the other hand… MacObserver Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:05 pm · Reply $ would solve that impasse. Apple is being cheap. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:13 pm · Reply This is a problem Apple is increasingly facing and fact is for all its rightful moral stance on the matter, too few are equally concerned to not put them at an increasingly important disadvantage. This I something they just have to solve and soon or they won’t be able to compete in many areas from Siri to web and card services. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:08 pm · Reply If this happens it will be one big embarrassment for Apple. Sadly the days when others were desperate to be part of Apple led strategies seems long gone. Indeed should this take off then it will be more than embarrassment, it will lead to the return of the Apple demise clock in many quarters as others are seen to be able to take Apple’s ideas and do better at getting them over the line, the ultimate in humiliation. Some re invigoration is sorely needed, let’s hope there is at least some sign of that at the Mac event, though not holding my breath. yojimbo007 Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 3:11 pm · Reply this is a total shame… unless Apple has something going on behind the closed doors too … DavGreg Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 6:15 pm · Reply A La Carte – not a bundle. CBS is of no importance. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 2:47 am · Reply The concept of “a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month” is going to go over like a lead balloon. After the FAIL of these disparate for-charge services, we’re going to see a shakeup in the industry. It’s going to be very interesting to watch. The old guard of the media oligarchy are going to be reaching for their nitroglycerin pills. IOW: Stormy seas ahead.

At this point, all we can do is nitpick, zooming into 100% crops and analyzing every last Pixel. By now we’ve all heard Google’s claims that the camera in their new line of Pixel smartphones isn’t just one of the best smartphone cameras on the market — it’s the king of them all. Well, that’s if DxOMark’s review is to be believed, with the Google Pixel receiving high-marks in just about every area, narrowly beating out even the Samsung Galaxy S7 with its camera prowess. So what’s so special about the Pixel? Well, on camera hardware is on part with most other offerings. The Pixel is equipped with a 12.3MP Sony IMX378 image sensor that features 1.55um pixels and an f/2.0 lens to help capture more light. There aren’t too many devices using this same hardware, but the guys at XDA had a great write up of everything the sensor is technically capable of. But it’s in the software and Google’s finely tuned image processing where the Pixel truly shines. How does HDR+ work? We know, most phones these days feature some type of HDR mode in their camera app (with varying results). Even last year’s Nexus devices featured HDR+, but nobody is doing it the way Google does on the Pixel. First off, HDR+ is now instant. There’s no delay when capturing photos like we saw on previous Nexus devices. That’s because the Pixel’s HDR+ is leveraging the Snapdragon 821’s new Hexagon digital signal processor processor. HDR+ Off, Auto, On This allows the camera to begin capturing RAW photos in the background as soon as the camera app is opened. These images are all underexposed and once combined (after the shutter button is pressed), produces a much sharper, less noisy shot with dramatically more detail in highlights that would normally be blown out in other smartphone cameras. Unfortunately, this doesn’t do much for lightening up shadows (something the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 excel at with their respective HDR methods), but it is what it is. Because the Pixel’s camera doesn’t have to take a single loooong exposure like on other devices, it’s a big reason why Google didn’t feel the need to include OIS on the Pixel — they don’t need it. As for video, we’ll get to that later… HDR+ Off, Auto, On That’s not to say the images the Pixel captures are perfect. There’s a fair amount of noise. A great deal more than what you normally see on competing devices and depending on who you ask, this could be off-putting. This was actually a conscious move by Google to preserve finer details in photos — a stark contrast to the noise filtering you see on most smartphones these days, resulting in a watercolor-like effect that looks artificial. With the Pixel, you’ll see concrete for what it is, couch fibers, hair, pimples — every detail and imperfection. Sure it’s a little more noisy, but it’s a worthwhile trade-off if you ask us. Although we’d give the Pixel the slight edge in outdoor daytime shots, it’s during moderate to low light situations where the phone absolutely blows past the competition. Simply put, no phone out there can match this level of image quality. We’re not talking about taking photos in pitch darkness, but indoors or restaurant lighting where devices like the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 struggle. Not only do they lose much of their detail, photos are mostly washed out at higher ISOs, practically monochrome in some instances. The Pixel’s HDR+ on the other hand, pulls much richer colors in low light — all without blowing out highlights, a pitfall of other cameras who use slower shutter speeds to capture more light. In almost ever instance we could test, the difference was like night and day. The Pixel’s HDR+ is a force to be reckoned. I will say I think I still prefer the (slower) method on previous Nexus devices, but it’s really hard to compete with zero shutter lag. For more on how the Pixel stacks up against the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, check out our comparison post here. The downside to using HDR+ Auto on the Pixel? There really is none — so leave it on 24/7. My only issue with HDR+ Auto/On My only complaint is the way Google named the two HDR+ shooting modes. On most devices, “HDR Auto” means the phone decides when is the best time to use HDR (like when there’s a lot of really dark and bright areas in a shot). Sometimes it engages, sometimes it doesn’t. This is much different on the Pixel where HDR+ Auto means HDR+ will always be used. For every shot. The only time it’s not used is when you fire off too many shots and the phone’s buffer can’t keep up. For instance, taking 5 shots in rapid succession will cause HDR+ to skip the 6th and subsequent shots unless you give it a quick second to finish buffering. I also thought that HDR+ Auto would occasionally trigger that extreme HDR we see with HDR+ On, but it doesn’t. So once again, having HDR+ Auto enabled means it will always be used. HDR+ On, aka Super HDR+ When it comes to the HDR+ On, you may be thinking that (like with every other camera out there) it simply means HDR+ will be used for every shot. But if that’s already what HDR+ Auto does — what the heck is the difference? Well, think of HDR+ On as a more extreme version of HDR+ Auto. Like Super HDR+ if you will. Where as HDR+ Auto gently brings down highlights, HDR+ On is much more aggressive. It’s closer to real HDR photographs you see with DSLRs which means it often times comes off as looking artificial. It doesn’t do much to bring out shadows, but sometimes you’ll find a teensy bit more detail in dark areas. There’s decent shutter lag too, just like with HDR+ on older Nexuses. Shots take about 1 second to fully capture a photo. It’s definitely not for everyone and unlike previous Nexus devices — where HDR+ On was perfect for low lighting conditions — there’s significant noise using HDR+ On in low light (much more than HDR+ Auto). But if you’re taking a picture of a building at night and want to get all the brightly lit details inside, it can be perfect for that. Front facing camera using HDR+ Off, Auto, On The front facing camera also reaps the benefits of the Pixel’s amazing HDR+ modes. There’s a crazy amount of color detail (almost to a fault), with selfies that are always perfectly exposed, even in low light. On every other smartphone, I never understood how people could willingly choose to use a sh*tty front facing camera to capture a special moment but on the Pixel, there’s very little sacrifice. Simply put: thanks to HDR+, this is the best front facing camera around, hands down. Video so stable, it’s like magic Like most other high-end devices these days, the Pixel is capable of shooting 4K UHD video. The difference is Google is using software tricks to keep the video steady — not OIS. You may think this wouldn’t be as nice a hardware solution, seeing as how traditional EIS zooms in on a video, sacrificing image clarity in an effort to smooth out shakes and jitters. The Pixel on the other hand uses a combination of the phone’s hardware (gyroscope) and software to help with the rolling shutter and smooth out video. There’s very little “jello” side-effect you see in other EIS solutions. While it works damn near perfect in outdoor daytime situations, it’s all but nullified in low light where the software has a difficult time figuring out what’s going on to keep video stabilized. See our results below. Video with the front facing camera caps out at 1080p and although the quality is there, doesn’t seem to benefit from the same EIS as the rear camera. One of my favorite features with video capture is the option to pause in the middle of video, making it perfect for capturing an event, birthday, or wedding, without having to worry about splicing together clips after the fact. There’s also the ability to snap “photos” while recording video, but it’s mostly just a screen cap of the video being recorded. All in all, video on the Pixel looks great. It’s clean, stable, and one of the best reasons to own the phone (providing you don’t shoot too much footage after dark). My biggest gripe with video on the Pixel has been audio quality, which is still quite average. I have yet to test the audio in a concert setting, but will report back with my findings when I do. Software Although the Pixel’s camera software isn’t anywhere near as robust as you’d find on devices like the Galaxy S7 or LG V20, it’s still a big upgrade from previous generation Nexuses. There’s no pro mode to fine tune every camera setting, but Google did update the app by adding the ability to adjust white balance (presets) and introducing the sometimes handy focus/exposure lock. AF/AE is activated by long pressing anywhere in the view finder and once engaged, allows you to manually adjust the exposure by sliding your finger up or down. It doesn’t give you a full range of exposure control, only 2 stops from where you initially locked it. Other available shooting modes include: Slow Motion – 240fps at 720p, or 120fps at 1080p Panorama – There are 4 options for shooting a panorama: Horizontal, vertical, big, or fisheye Photo Sphere – Capture a full, 360-degree image Lens Blur – Create a shallow depth of field effect by blurring out the background of an object The software is really nothing to write home about. It’s simple and intuitive and there are enough “fun” features to easily give the Pixel camera a leg up on the iPhone. The few manual controls are a nice addition, but we’re hoping this is just the beginning of what Google is planning for their camera app. The only thing missing — at least for me — was an official Android alternative to Live Photos. Perhaps I’m alone in this, but Live Photos are easily one of my favorite camera features from the iPhone and if there was ever going to be a proper Android alternative, the Pixel would do it. I mean, it’s already shooting off a million photos in the background, just give us the option to turn those into Live Photos. Performance This is where we’ll talk briefly about the performance of the camera app. Launch times are extremely quick. Tap on the camera app and it launches in almost no time flat. Google also added a handy shortcut where double tapping the power button can wake the phone and launch directly into the app. Fire too quick, and HDR+ Auto might not activate (remember, it takes about a second for the phone to buffer the background photos it needs for HDR+). When it comes to auto focus, the Pixel uses a combination of phase detection and laser auto focus for mostly stellar results. It’s quick and accurate in most settings, although nowhere near in the same ballpark as the Galaxy S7’s Dual Pixel auto focus. We did find that it can, at times, be somewhat inconsistent and you still get that hunting (focusing in/out) when it attempt to lock onto something. For when it does act up, tap to focus always comes in handy, although it forces the camera app to expose for whatever you just tapped. The Pixel can also fire off bursts of photos by holding the shutter button, choosing the photo it feels is the “best” of the bunch (along with 7 runner ups). It’s called “Smartburst” and although you wont get the HDR+ benefits by shooting this way, it could be helpful when attempting to capture a fast moving subject. Smartburst can also creation GIFs from these bursts, or allow you to create a collage, which is a nice touch. Beware the flare Examples of the weird flaring I occasionally see pop up in some of my shots Although I didn’t see this mentioned in most of the early reviews, I did notice some pretty apparent lens flares. It’s not all of the time, only whenever light — be it direct sunlight, light from a window, or even a ceiling light — would hit the camera the right way. The crazy part is not only the rear camera that suffers from this, it also popped up when using the front facing camera as well. Not a huge deal-breaker by any means, but something worth mentioning. ***** Mobile photography is always inconsistent at best and there’s no single smartphone camera that excels in every area. Whereas most manufacturers are hellbent on tackling the issue with bigger and badder hardware (higher megapickles, dual-cameras, OIS or GTFO), Google is focusing on computational photography. They’re not just working harder, they’re working smarter. For the first time it feels like Google is finally taking mobile photography seriously. While individual tastes may differ, there’s really no denying the results. From brightly lit environments, to low light, to video stabilization and the like, it’s going to be black magic as far as most people are concerned. That’s how good the Pixel camera is. Yes, there are plenty of great options out there when shopping around for a great smartphone camera (even mid-range-ish $400 devices), but we can safely say — without a shadow of a doubt — the Pixel safely sits at the top of that list. We’re sure to see further advancements in this space and although it’s not by a huge margin, Google can finally say that for a brief moment in time, they were the best. Good job, Google. You earned it. local_offer    Pixel   Pixel XL   Resources   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (18) stars Further Reading First things to do with Le Pro 3 The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again Google Daydream View: Best Tips & Tricks Google Daydream View: First Things You Should Do Google Daydream View Review stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Starting today, both products are available for pre-order. Currently, if you head on over to the Google Store, you will be able to add a Daydream View to your cart and order it. Going for $79, Google states that it will ship out the VR headset to you in two to three weeks. For now, only the Slate color is available for purchase. If you don’t feel like picking it up from Google, Verizon is also accepting Daydream View pre-orders here. It still costs $79 for the VR headset but the wireless carrier does state that it will ship by November 16. Just remember that if you’ve already pre-ordered the Pixel or Pixel XL from either Google or Verizon, you should receive a promotional code for a free Daydream View several weeks after your phone ships. The Chromecast Ultra is also available for pre-order on the Google Store for $69. Much like the Chromecasts of previous years, the Ultra plugs into an HDMI port in the back of your television and allows you to cast content onto the screen with your phone, tablet, or computer as the remote. The Ultra brings with it the ability to stream 4K and HDR content plus it is able to plug into Ethernet with no additional accessories required. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

This isn’t the first version of Google’s voice search technology, but it is the friendliest. Apple kicked off this trend with Siri on the iPhone 4s. Siri started with a lot of personality and has slowly gained more useful features. Google took a different path. They started with a lot of great features and very little personality. Now, they are going for both. Google Assistant is basically an evolved version of Google Now. It does a lot of the same stuff, but with a different pizazz. The personality is more important than some people might think. Siri received a ton of attention at the beginning because of the jokes and witty responses. Google’s voice search was infinitely more useful in everyday life, but it didn’t receive nearly as much publicity. So how does Assistant compare with Siri now? Let’s take a look. Here is the full list of commands we used in the video above. Call my wife Send a text to Holly Send a tweet remind me to mow the lawn tomorrow Show me fast food nearby How far is it to Ford Field Open Chrome Go to Phandroid.com Who won the Nobel prize last year who won the NBA playoffs what time is the Cubs game Get me an Uber What’s the square root of 64 How old is John Oliver Where was he born Show me news about Rogue One When does it come out? What am I doing on Friday Show me photos of lake Michigan What movies are playing nearby What’s the weather like in Cleveland, OH My favorite color is blue What’s my favorite color Let’s play a game Tell me a joke Who has the best memory? Assistant and Siri both display information in a conversational format. It’s meant to feel like you’re talking to a real person. A real person can remember things that you previously asked about. A real person can also remember things about you. A few of the questions above have follow-up questions. Assistant and Siri both handled the first one well. I asked “how old is John Oliver” and then “where was he born?” Both recognized that the second question was still about Oliver. Next, I asked for “news about Rogue One” and then “when is it coming out?” Assistant understood that I was still talking about Rogue One and told me the release date. Siri asked me to pick a movie. The next test comes with asking for information to be remembered for later. Both allow you to say things like “My wife is _____” and it will be remembered when you say “call my wife.” But what about other stuff? Assistant will remember anything you tell it. I said “my favorite color is blue” and Assistant was able to repeat that when I asked, “what is my favorite color?” Siri got sassy and said, “I can’t read minds.” Where are the apps? One of Siri’s new tricks in iOS 10 is greater integration with apps. This is something that demoed on Google Assistant at I/O, but it’s not available yet. The first app-related command was about composing a tweet. I asked both to “send a tweet.” Google Assistant pulled up some random web article about Twitter. Siri asked, “what would you like to say?” I could then recite my tweet, have it read back, and send it, all without touching the phone. Next, I asked for an Uber. Assistant shared the Uber sign-up page web result. Siri said, “I don’t see an app for that.” If I had the Uber app installed, it would have ordered a ride for me. Assistant will eventually be able to do more with apps, but right now Siri is winning this category. Who’s more fun now? I started this article by saying Siri had more personality at launch. However, now I would argue that Google has surpassed Apple in this category as well. Assistant has a huge library of Easter eggs and silly responses. It can tell jokes, play games, and even recite poetry. If you know the secret command, you can even play a silly game show. When I asked Siri to play a game it said: “that is beyond my abilities.” I asked for a joke and Siri said: “nope…can’t think of one.” Hilarious. Siri has lost some of its sense of humor over the years. Who reigns supreme? There are a lot of things that these two virtual assistants do well, but they both have weaknesses. Google Assistant is better at remembering information and allowing you to reference things from earlier in the conversation. Siri is better at working with other apps on your phones. Assistant also seems to be capable of more fun if that’s important to you. The question is, which assistant is the best right now? Both will continue to get better. Google Assistant will get new features when Google Home is released and Siri improves with every release of iOS.

It was at its event on October 4th that the company launched the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. It also launched a handful of other products at the event, such as the 4K-ready Chromecast Ultra as well as the Daydream View VR headset. Both the streaming media player and headset are now available for purchase from the Google Store. Chromecast Ultra is essentially the same dongle as the existing Chromecast, the only major feature it offers is support for 4K streaming. You don’t need that feature if you don’t have a 4K TV. It costs $69 and the Google Store mentions that orders placed now will be shipped within 2-3 weeks. The Daydream View VR headset is based on the Daydream platform that Google unveiled earlier this year. The Pixel and Pixel XL are currently the only major smartphones that work with this headset but other OEM partners will be launching their Daydream-compatible handsets by next year. Even though Google said at the event that the headset is going to be available in a variety of colors, currently it can only be ordered in slate gray from the Google Store. Daydream View costs $79 and it will also ship within 2-3 weeks after the order is placed. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about Daydream View, Google, pixel and pixel xl.

Google is looking to offer a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month, according to media executives who have heard the pitch.” “Apple Inc. has explored putting together its own discounted online TV bundle, but ran into issues securing media rights on the terms it wanted,” Flint and Ramachandran report. “Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. 21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Well, at least somebody is capable of getting ink. It’s quite possible that without Steve Jobs’ help, Eddy Cue couldn’t get ink in a stationery store. Just kidding (sort of)! But, boy this is taking eons to accomplish, isn’t it? — MacDailyNews, November 5, 2015 As we wrote last December: “It’s 2015. This should’ve happened already. At this rate, America will back on the moon before Eddy Cue gets the contracts inked. So, before we’re dead, m’kay?” Apple’s Internet TV service, if it ever happens, would have to have ESPN. It will also likely require the “Big Four” networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) – although it could launch with three out of four and eventually hammer out a deal with whichever one is being the most reticent. That said, at this late date, Apple might as well wait until they have a full dance card. What else would you consider to be must-haves? Beyond the Big Four, if you go by primetime ratings (total viewers), the top 20 U.S. cable networks are: 1. ESPN 2. Fox News Channel 2. USA 3. TBS 4. Disney 5. Discovery Channel 6. History Channel 7. TNT 8. HGTV 9. Nickelodeon 10. AMC 11. Adult Swim 12. FX 13. Cartoon Network 14. Food Channel 15. Lifetime 16. ABC Family 17. Syfy 18. TLC 19. Hallmark 20.

Nothing to do with cost, Eddie or any other deficiency. Alphabet on the other hand… MacObserver Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:05 pm · Reply $ would solve that impasse. Apple is being cheap. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:13 pm · Reply This is a problem Apple is increasingly facing and fact is for all its rightful moral stance on the matter, too few are equally concerned to not put them at an increasingly important disadvantage. This I something they just have to solve and soon or they won’t be able to compete in many areas from Siri to web and card services. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:08 pm · Reply If this happens it will be one big embarrassment for Apple. Sadly the days when others were desperate to be part of Apple led strategies seems long gone. Indeed should this take off then it will be more than embarrassment, it will lead to the return of the Apple demise clock in many quarters as others are seen to be able to take Apple’s ideas and do better at getting them over the line, the ultimate in humiliation. Some re invigoration is sorely needed, let’s hope there is at least some sign of that at the Mac event, though not holding my breath. yojimbo007 Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 3:11 pm · Reply this is a total shame… unless Apple has something going on behind the closed doors too … DavGreg Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 6:15 pm · Reply A La Carte – not a bundle. CBS is of no importance. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 2:47 am · Reply The concept of “a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month” is going to go over like a lead balloon. After the FAIL of these disparate for-charge services, we’re going to see a shakeup in the industry. It’s going to be very interesting to watch. The old guard of the media oligarchy are going to be reaching for their nitroglycerin pills. IOW: Stormy seas ahead.

Google recently announced the new Coldline cloud storage offering and lowered pricing for all of its storage tiers. However, challenges remain that hold Google back from being a cloud storage powerhouse. By Conner Forrest | October 20, 2016, 9:03 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/peangdao Google recently dropped pricing on all of its cloud storage tiers and announced a new cold storage option called Coldline. The news is sure to keep the cloud price wars going, but it may not be enough to win enterprises over to Google storage. The new Coldline tier is specifically for rarely-accessed data and archival storage. It costs $0.007 per GB, per month, and it also carries an access fee of five cents. If desired, Google also offers a fast access option that will bring you millisecond access. The Google Coldline tier costs the same amount as Amazon's Glacier storage. Google's Multi-Regional storage tier, which positions itself as a good option for video, multimedia, and business continuity, now costs $0.026 per GB, per month. It offers multiple geographic storage regions in the US, the EU, and Asia to improve redundancy. SEE: G Suite's productivity updates could win Google some fans in the enterprise The Nearline tier is for data accessed infrequently, but more often than the Coldline tier. It is the second-cheapest option at $0.01 per GB, per month, and Google touts it as suitable for backup, longtail content, and rarely-accessed documents. It also has a $0.01 per GB retrieval cost. The second most expensive option is the Regional storage tier, which costs $0.02 per GB, per month. It offers millisecond access and is positioned as a good fit for transcoding, data analytics, and general computing. Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy The price drops are a step in the right direction for Google, but the big three cloud providers (AWS, Google, Microsoft Azure) have been competing so heavily on price that it is almost table-stakes at this point. The bigger issues for Google, at least in terms of cloud storage, are features and functionality. In the IaaS and PaaS space, Google is only really competing with Amazon and Microsoft, but the storage space has a broader set of competitors, often with more useful features for professionals. For example, in Google, it's difficult to change the ownership of an article. Also, providers such as Dropbox and Box seem to offer more granular access and permissions for each file and folder. Google did recently update its G Suite apps with new productivity features which could improve collaboration, and it needs to continue on that track to win over business customers. Earlier this year, at the Google Cloud Platform Next conference, Google announced that it had signed up a host of major enterprise customers. And, these lower prices could help it continue to attract big businesses. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google dropped the pricing on all of its cloud storage tiers and added a new option for cold storage called Coldline. Google is well positioned to compete with other providers on price, but needs stronger features and functionality for enterprise users. This further solidifies Google's push with big business, after it announced multiple enterprise clients back in March. Click here to subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter.

Licklider was bringing his dream of the “Intergalactic Computer Network” to fruition with ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency).  ARPANET would go on to become the foundation for the internet as we know it today. At that time, computing was limited to enterprises relying on mainframes for bulk data processing. Ironically, many of the fundamental principles of mainframe computing are still in use with cloud computing.     Fast forward to the late 1990s when Marc Benioff started delivering enterprise-level applications over the internet with Salesforce. Shortly thereafter, many of the big cloud players we know today entered the picture.  Amazon Web Services launched its first platform in 2002, and in 2009 Google released Google Apps, a suite of browser-based office applications which sought to antiquate Microsoft’s desktop-based office applications. Microsoft, in response to Google Apps, launched its Business Productivity Office Suite (BPOS), which simply migrated desktop applications to the cloud.   Today, cloud services are rampant, and cloud migrations seem a mere formality. It’s no longer a matter of if one should move to the cloud, but when and how.   Rising Demand for the Hybrid Cloud In the early 2010s, few technologists were disputing the operational benefits of cloud computing. However, cloud migrations presented certain technical constraints around security, compliance and availability.  As a result of those constraints, the need for a sort of computing bridge was realized. The manifestation of that bridge was the hybrid cloud, a combination of traditional data centers and cloud solutions.  These hybrid solutions allowed organizations to leverage many operational benefits of the cloud while maintaining security, compliance and stability. In short, hybrid solutions let organizations embrace the cloud at their own pace.   How Hybrid SharePoint Came to Be Microsoft’s first iteration of SharePoint was released in 2001, as the spiritual successor to Site Server. SharePoint’s initial function was to provide organizations with the tools they need to enhance productivity.  Over the years, the once bug-riddled SharePoint grew into the content management system we’re now familiar with.  As SharePoint matured, cloud computing stormed onto the scene and changed everything. Businesses quickly realized the benefits of the cloud, and the demand for cloud services soared as a result.  Ever opportunistic, Microsoft released Office 365 to answer that demand. SharePoint was late to join the cloud party due to the previously mentioned constraints, but IT departments were still intrigued by applying the benefits of the cloud to internal content management. Hybrid SharePoint emerged to balance the compliance and security needs, with the operational benefits of cloud.   Hybrid SharePoint Today Today, organizations are empowered to exercise end-to-end control of their SharePoint deployment.  Want to go completely cloud? Go ahead Want to remain entirely on-premises? Your call Want a customized hybrid solution? Go for it  Hybrid SharePoint’s features are robust and practical, so much so that the average user is unable to tell what sort of computing infrastructure is responsible for serving up the content they need. Previously, instances of SharePoint Online would have to operate almost independently of SharePoint on-premises.  That’s no longer the case with Microsoft’s focus on Hybrid unification. Check out these three new features: Unified search: IT administrators have long dealt with the headache of disparate search results pages. Searching SharePoint Online would return different results compared to searching SharePoint on-premises. Now, regardless of where content is hosted, it’s indexable and searchable    Unified taxonomy: Allows administrators to easily create shared taxonomies between on-premises SharePoint and SharePoint Online  Unified auditing: Administrators can now analyze detailed logs of file activity across site collections, and Office 365 Hybrid SharePoint Tomorrow So what can we expect from SharePoint Hybrid computing in the future? At Ignite, Microsoft talked about the future in broad strokes but didn’t reveal specifics.  With that being said, I would predict: Point and click cloud migration: Doesn’t it just feel as though you should be able to click on an on-premises hosted site, and migrate it to a cloud location?  Microsoft, if you are listening, this should be a standard feature of SharePoint: “one-click site move to the cloud.” Updated UX: Some days SharePoint just plain stinks. The user experience feels outdated, and accessing content requires too many clicks. Microsoft is bringing modern experience to the cloud and soon to follow on-premises. What do you think the future has in store for SharePoint Hybrid?

China's LeEco sets out to shake up US consumer tech market From the Associated Press Oct 20, 2016 AP Photo | Jeff Chiu Rob Chandhok, LeEco North America chief research and development officer, holds a LePro 3 phone while speaking at an event in San Francisco, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. SAN FRANCISCO — Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco's online store, LeWeb.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China." LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users." Innovation in the U.S. has hit a "bottleneck," making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as "Trojan horses," to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives." Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. consumer electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other prominent chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, California, where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex "EcoWorld." "They are not taking a half-baked approach," Goertz said. "But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

Yeah, sure, there’s another debate to take the airwaves Wednesday night, but there’s really no debate: America is great and her people are great — and, it’s pretty clear, sitting here today, with the Give It Forward Today & #beTheGIFT calendar that says on the 19th of October, thank as many people as possible — and, really, the truth is, the whole world wants to thank you, America. You’re the people who gave the world Broadway and Google and delivery pizza and YouTube and the best road trips on the planet. You’re the people who gave the world the internet, the language the whole world now speaks in. Who gave us the Wright brothers and the whole world wings, who gave us Thomas Edison and the light bulb and ignited something in all of us.

The people who gave us lasers and calculators and the Commodore 64, gave us all washing machines and Facebook and photocopiers and popcorn makers and the jukebox to crank out the best tunes.

Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → You’re the people who propelled us off the planet, who put footprints on the moon, who are shooting to get humankind to Mars, and America, you are the people who never stop shooting for the stars and will not let the best vision of humanity be shot down by divisions or politicians or opposing positions. You’re the country that welcomed in a six year old boy from Russia, Sergey Brin — who would one day co-found Google. You’re the people who offered refuge to Andy Grove, a Hungarian who hid from the Nazis as a kid, who came to America and founded one of the leaders in the global tech industry — Intel — and you’re the country who made a home for a scared Ukranian teen, Jan Koum, and gave his family food stamps to stay alive — and that same kid would one day co-found Whatsapp that just sold for $19 billion. No debate or vote or campaign can undermine it, because it’s undeniable and all of you, America, hold these truths to be self-evident — that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness — and you will hold on to each other no matter what because you not only believe these things, you aim to live these things no matter what. Because America? You’re a great incubator of dreams, a lab for human possibilities, a seedbed for visions of hope to grow, a beacon of refuge and liberty to the tired and huddled masses and an election doesn’t change the DNA of who you are, a campaign season cannot undo the heart of you that beats from the winding sublimeness of Highway 1 to the general stores of the Blue Ridge Parkway, and no vote can derail that you’re a family who knows that if an election is allowed to destroy friendships, then it’s America that loses. If an election is allowed to destroy friendships, then it’s America that loses. Thank you, America, for being the people who know that —- no matter who takes the White House in November, there are people in God’s House who will keep taking hope into the streets. Thank you, America, for knowing that ultimately good news isn’t the wheelhouse of the government —- it’s ultimately the reality of the gospel. Thank you, America, for being a pioneering people who believe in Seed Lives, who believe in breaking hard ground, who aren’t afraid to plow deeper to grow greater, who believe that the smallest seeds of kindness can begin to break the worst kind of brokenness The smallest seeds of kindness can begin to break the worst kind of brokenness. The world thanks you, America — for believing in liberty, for hoping in possibility, for fighting against poverty, and bigotry, and misery, for living neighbourly, and choosing unity and accepting diversity and being grace in community. America, the world thanks you, for not only being a land of great people, but for being one of the greatest ideas of the world.

By Nick Heath | October 20, 2016, 8:53 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/KeongDaGreat The smash hit game Pokemon Go provided perhaps the ultimate test of the claim that cloud computing can scale to meet demand. The augmented reality, collect-em-up has been downloaded more than 500 million times, making it one of the most popular mobile apps of 2016. The sheer number of people hankering to catch Pokemon not only generated headlines, it also caught Pokemon Go's creators Niantic by surprise. The game, which relies on more than a dozen Google Cloud Platform services, created far more network traffic than Niantic's thought possible, ultimately generating five times the demand Niantic expected under its worst case scenario. The first sign that they may have underestimated player numbers came within 15 minutes of launching Pokemon Go, which initially went live in Australia and New Zealand, when player traffic ballooned to levels far beyond Niantic's expectations. "We ended up 50 percent over our worst case after day one, we figured this was going to be bad within six hours," Phil Keslin, CTO at Niantic told the Google Cloud Platform Next conference in London. "It was a hair on fire experience." Niantic's projections were far below actual traffic generated by Pokemon Go's initial launch. Image: Niantic/Google Making the clamour for the game even more challenging was the small size of Niantic's engineering team handling the launch for Pokemon Go. "The team that made this happen was four engineers," said Keslin. Given the unexpected surge for the Australia and New Zealand launch, Niantic appealed to Google for help with the US release the next day. Niantic worked with about 40 Google Cloud Platform staff, from Customer Reliability Engineering and Site Reliability Engineering, development, product, support and executive teams, to ramp up the allocated infrastructure to cope with traffic levels far higher than originally envisioned. However, the launch period didn't pass without incident, following the US and Australian launch, players complained of downtime and dropped connections, as Google Cloud Platform services such as Google BigQuery and BigTable came under unforeseen pressure. "BigTable, BigQuery, everything was blowing up when this was happening," said Keslin. The problems even prompted Werner Vogels, CTO at Google Cloud Platform rival Amazon Web Services to tweet asking Niantic to let him know if there was anything AWS could do to help. Niantic and Google worked together to solve each issue, reviewing each part of the architecture used to identify the source of each problem. Complicating the matter of resolving issues were the millions of new players joining the game each day. In an operation described as 'swapping out a plane's engine in-flight', Google and Niantic upgraded Pokemon Go to run on a newer version of Google Container Engine (GKE) at a time when millions of new players were signing up to play the game. The move allowed more than one thousand additional nodes to be added to Pokemon Go's container cluster, in preparation for the high demand expected for the forthcoming launch in Japan. Other upgrades carried out on the live production system, included replacing the Network Load Balancer with the more sophisticated HTTP/S Load Balancer, in order to offer faster connections to users and a higher overall traffic throughput. The upshot was the launch in Japan passed off without incident, despite the number of new users signing up to play being triple that of the earlier US launch. "We had people on the Google side reprovisioning resources to get us where we needed to be," said Keslin. "That saved our bacon." Click here to subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter.

By Harmeet Singh October 20, 2016 Best Buy Canada has announced a new partnership with Google Canada, which will bring 14 “Google shops” into its stores. The collaboration is the first of its kind in North America and will involve Best Buy hosting 14 of the shops in its newly renovated “experience stores.” Ten, smaller versions of those shops will begin operating today across Canada. Four more are set to debut in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Mississauga before the end of the year. Those shops will be larger (around 700 square feet) and more interactive, featuring things like surround screens. The shops will include Google’s hardware – such as the new Pixel smartphone, Daydream View VR headset and Chromecast Ultra (the latter two available later this year)  – and will “provide immersive experiences that help users get the most out of their devices,” Best Buy said in a press release. For all 14 shops, customers can book one-on-one appointments with Google staff to learn more about specific products. Given that Google doesn’t release new hardware products as often as other tech brands, the shops are largely experiential, with workshops focused on how to get the most out of its various products and apps Examples include a hands-on experience of Google Play Games, a workshop to plan the ideal holiday trip using Google hardware and apps, and “family time with Google,” a workshop for kids and friendly focused on child-friendly products.
