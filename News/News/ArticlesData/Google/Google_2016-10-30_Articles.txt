Google takes the Apple approach and the resulting Pixel smartphone should worry Android OEMs By Robert Martin, InvestorPlace Writer  |  Nov 1, 2016, 6:00 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Priceline Group Inc (PCLN) Stock: Q3 Earnings Glance GOOG vs. GOOGL: Everything You Need to Know About the Google Stock Split Recent Posts: Priceline Group Inc (PCLN) Stock: Q3 Earnings Glance Google Pixel Review: Is Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) the New Smartphone King? Charles Payne Tops Jim Cramer in Recent Ratings Report View All Posts Several weeks ago, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unveiled its first Google-branded smartphone, the Pixel. Source: Google Available in regular and plus sizes, the new Google Pixel is a significant development that goes much further than the previous Nexus brand smartphones. Those promised the best Android experience, but they were co-designed by hardware manufacturers such as HTC, who shared the billing. This time, Google is aiming for not only the best Android smartphone, but the title of best smartphone available. Period. Unlike with those Nexus phones, it’s charging a premium price for its all-new flagship. Does the Google Pixel have what it takes to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7? Is this smartphone’s steep price tag justified? Read our Google Pixel review to find out. Google Pixel Review: Google Takes the Apple Route Way back, Google and Apple took very different approaches in their respective smartphone strategies. Apple went with the completely closed approach, developing both the iOS operating system and the iPhone hardware. There was no third-party involvement whatsoever. 7 Growth Stocks That Should Replace Apple in Your Portfolio Google, however, licensed Android to any third-party smartphone manufacturers that wanted in. It stayed out of the hardware game, until dipping a toe in with the Nexus phones. While Google’s approach led to smartphone market domination — over 85% of all smartphones run Android — the platform suffers from fragmentation. With users at the mercy of OEMs and often stuck on older versions of Android, Google can only get its latest and greatest features out to a small percentage of users. With the Pixel, it’s taking the Apple approach. Unlike Nexus phones, Google didn’t just have say in some of the hardware features, it designed the smartphones. HTC manufactured them, but its name doesn’t appear anywhere on the case. And, like the iPhone, the Google Pixel was designed hand-in-hand with the latest version of Android to ensure the ideal experience. Google Assistant — one of its key features — isn’t even available on third-party smartphones, assuming they were updated to the latest Android version. Buy a Google Pixel and you get a flagship smartphone, optimized to take full advantage of Android, with exclusive features and quick access to future Android upgrades (and security updates), just like Apple’s iPhone and iOS. Google Pixel Review: Solid Hardware With a Killer Camera The similarity to Apple’s smartphone approach continues. Like the iPhone, the Pixel is a thin, rounded slab of machined aluminum and glass. There are differences, though, especially on the back of the Pixel, which has a section with a mirror polish and fingerprint scanner. But from the front? From a distance they bear a striking resemblance. The hardware inside the Pixel is more than capable of providing snappy performance, with the latest Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon CPU providing the power. Apple realized early on that the camera is very important for many smartphone buyers. The dual-camera system is the feature for the new iPhone 7 Plus. Google clearly saw the same data and the Pixel phone’s camera is excellent. In fact, Google claims independent testing rates it as the best smartphone camera ever. And, the company tops that off with free unlimited photo and video storage for Google Pixel owners. What Google ended up releasing is a premium flagship smartphone with a class-leading camera, high performance and the best Android experience. Not bad for a first attempt.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Any app store is prone to fraudulent material, whether it’s spam-filled apps that somehow sneak through the system or fake reviews and ratings. Google knows this and, on Monday, introduced new changes to the Google Play Store that will help fight fraudulent activity. It should improve the experience for everyone, including end-users and honest developers alike. “Today we are rolling out improved detection and filtering systems to combat such manipulation attempts,” Google said on Monday. “If an install is conducted with the intention to manipulate an app’s placement on Google Play, our systems will detect and filter it. Furthermore, developers who continue to exhibit such behaviors could have their apps taken down from Google Play.” Make sure you’re following the anti-fraud rules Google knows that there are fair ways to promote applications in the Google Play Store and that honest developers do indeed tap third-party marketing companies to help surface results. The company says that’s fine, so long as those firms are abiding by preset rules set by Google. Basically, Google doesn’t want some developer coughing up $5,000 for to some mysterious person online who’s willing to use a combination of magic and hackery to improve an app’s ranking. Google said the changes will help the integrity of Google Play and indeed it will. There’s nothing worse than seeing good reviews for an application and then installing it only to find that it’s some trashy fraud.

Sometimes they go about it the legal way, and sometimes they go about it the illegal way. In the mobile scene, what some developers do to bring attention to their app is by using all kinds of trickery, like manipulating app placement, fake reviews, and more. Turns out that Google has had enough of this and has announced that they will be looking to crack down on Play Store fraud. According to Google, “Today we are rolling out improved detection and filtering systems to combat such manipulation attempts. If an install is conducted with the intention to manipulate an app’s placement on Google Play, our systems will detect and filter it. Furthermore, developers who continue to exhibit such behaviors could have their apps taken down from Google Play.” Now Google has always been pretty swift to act when it comes to handling fake apps or apps that violate its policy, so basically this move is kicking it into the next gear. Google adds, “These attempts not only violate the Google Play Developer Policy, but also harm our community of developers by hindering their chances of being discovered or recommended through our systems. Ultimately, they put the end users at risk of making wrong decisions based on inaccurate, unauthentic information.” Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Android, Apps and Google.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Microsoft Windows has a bug and now everyone knows about it thanks to Google. In its Security Blog, Google disclosed a bug they discovered in Windows ten days ago. In that time, Google sent out a security patch for Chrome on Windows, but the overall OS is still vulnerable to potential attacks now that news has gotten out. The bug is a win32k system flaw, which means possible attackers can get through sandboxes meant to keep these attackers at bay. The Chrome patch used to prevent this security threat from affecting Google users blocks wink32k via a lockdown. The original bug also involved exploiting an Adobe Flash bug, but a patch for this bug has already been pushed. Google branded the bug as critical given that it believes the bug “is being actively exploited,” to use their own words. This is obviously a serious issue and should conceivably push Microsoft to speed up a security patch. Microsoft on the other hand, isn’t seeing that as a favor, and openly criticized Google’s disclosure of the bug. “We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and today’s disclosure by Google puts customers at risk,” stated a Microsoft spokesperson to VentureBeat. To avoid being at risk, update Flash as soon as possible and keep an eye out for Windows patches. Security is always important Google, Adobe and Microsoft have all taken steps to minimize the possible hazard of this bug, but it’s still an issue that Microsoft needs to address directly in its computer software. Users of these products should update to the latest version as soon as possible. Microsoft may not be too happy with Google disclosing the issue, conceivably alerting attackers to the bug, but a ten-day headstart should have been enough time for a fix to be administered and it hasn’t yet. Maybe this will speed up the process.

By Chris Duckett | October 31, 2016 -- 23:23 GMT (16:23 PDT) | Topic: Security Google's Threat Analysis Group has disclosed an exploit for Windows that the company says is being actively exploited. The vulnerability in question was discovered alongside yet another Flash exploit. "The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape," Google's Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard said in a blog post. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft to replace security bulletin index with database-driven portal High performance computing (HPC): A look at what's next with TACC's Dan Stanzione If you want a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, you have to wait until Christmas Researchers claim quantum computing breakthrough, explain it using beer "It can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a window handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD. Chrome's sandbox blocks win32k.sys system calls using the Win32k lockdown mitigation on Windows 10, which prevents exploitation of this sandbox escape vulnerability." The pair of researchers said they were releasing the unpatched vulnerability due to the rules set by the company's disclosure timeline. "Based on our experience, however, we believe that more urgent action -- within seven days -- is appropriate for critical vulnerabilities under active exploitation. The reason for this special designation is that each day, an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public, and unpatched, more computers will be compromised," the company states. "Seven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some vendors to update their products, but it should be enough time to publish advice about possible mitigations, such as temporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or contacting the vendor for more information." Last week, Google's Project Zero released the details of a use-after-free kernel vulnerability within XNU, the open-source foundation that is used for iOS and MacOS. "This bug could be leveraged for kernel memory corruption, and is reachable from interesting sandboxes including Safari and Chrome," Project Zero's Ian Beer wrote in a bug report. To address the issue, Apple needed to undertake a large amount of refactoring work, with the issue fixed in last week's MacOS 10.12.1 release and iOS 10 having a mitigation put in place in September. On its disclosure timeline, Google revealed that it was set to disclose the XNU vulnerability on September 21 despite multiple requests from Cupertino to hold off, but following a discussion between "senior leadership" at both Google and Apple, Google granted Apple a "five-week flexible disclosure extension".

Introduction2. Design3. Display, battery life4. Siri vs. Assistant5. Still camera6. Video camera7. ConclusionApple iPhone 7 Plus specificationGoogle Pixel XL specificationReview comments (92) Introduction Tenth generation versus the first of its kind - the iPhone 7 versus the Google Pixel, in their Plus-size versions (or XL in Google terms). There have been phones by Google, you may argue, but no Nexus has been the epitome of what an Android smartphone should be quite the same way that the Pixel is. Even though that's exactly what we were told for years. Well, now we know that Nexuses were for devs and geeks, and Pixels are for users. But going for the ultimate user experience is not the only way in which the Pixel resembles the iPhone, not at all. Google's latest has the iPhone 7 so well centered in its crosshairs that it matches its pricing to the dollar across sizes, storage options and markets. A premium price for a premium device - that's the message. With that premise, figuring out which one gives you a better value for your hard-earned cash (not an insignificant amount of it, too), comes down simply to which is the better phone. Looking at the specsheets alone, a few key differences emerge. Apple iPhone 7 Plus at a glance 5.5" 16M-color LED-backlit IPS LCD screen of 1080p resolution, 401ppi, wide color gamut, 3D Touch tech Quad-core (2+2) 64-bit Apple CPU, hexa-core GPU, 3GB of RAM, Apple A10 Fusion SoC Dual 12MP camera: wide-angle F/1.8 + telephoto F/2.8, easy switch and live bokeh effects, optical image stabilization, quad-LED flash, phase detection auto focus, wide color capture, face and body detection; 2160p@30fps video recording 7MP F/2.2 front-facing camera with BSI sensor and HDR mode, 1080p@30fps video Water-proof metal unibody with redesigned, less-obtrusive antenna strips Pressure-sensitive Home key powered by a brand new Taptic Engine Comes in 32, 128, and 256GB of built-in storage Second-gen Touch ID fingerprint sensor 4G LTE Cat.9 (600Mbps); Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac; Bluetooth 4.2; Lightning port; GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS; NFC (Apple Pay only) 2,900mAh battery Google Pixel XL at a glance 5.5" AMOLED screen of QHD resolution, 534ppi, 100% NTSC; 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 Quad-core Kryo processor, Adreno 530 GPU, 4GB of RAM, Snapdragon 821 chipset Google-loaded Android 7.1 Nougat; 2 years of OS upgrades from launch, 3 years of security updates 12.3MP camera, f/2.0 lens, 1.55µm pixels, Phase and Laser AF, dual-LED, dual-tone flash; 2160p and 1080p @ 30/60/120fps video capture 8MP selfie camera, f/2.4 lens, 1.4µm pixels; 1080p video capture Aerospace-grade aluminum unibody (glass window on the back); splash and dust resistant (IP53) Comes with 32GB or 128GB of built-in storage, no expansion Fingerprint reader, Android Pay LTE Cat 9 or 11 (450Mbps or 600Mbps downlink, 50/75Mbps uplink); Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 (A2DP, LE), GPS + GLONASS, NFC 3,450mAh battery; Fast charging over USB Type-C A few key differences are immediately notable, so let's start with those. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Dual 12MP camera with OIS (vs. single 12MP, no OIS) Water resistance (vs. splash resistance) Stereo speakers 3D Touch 256GB version Best mobile chipset Siri can certainly hold its own when it comes to controlling your phone with voice 4+ years of OS updates vs. 2 years of new OS updates and 3 years of security patches on the Pixel Google Pixel XL Sharper screen (534ppi vs. 401ppi) Lighter and marginally more compact (at the same screen size) Fast charging Headphone jack 3D Touch alternative by long-pressing Google Assistant might be the first actually useful digital assistant Daydream VR is perhaps the next big thing in the living room entertainment This won't be your usual battle of flagships here. We won't be dissecting the two smartphones chapter by chapter like we've done in the past. Instead we'll focus on the key stuff - display, battery, and camera. And since Google Assistant is among the Pixel's major selling points, we'll touch on how it fares against Siri. But not before we share some thoughts on the controversial topics of design and appeal.

The Google Home assistant will be available starting November 4, this is when Google will ship the pre-ordered units, and this is when retailers should stock them and sell them online. Android Police reports that one of its readers actually saw the Google Home available for sale at their local Walmart. According to that reader, a Walmart employee would not sell him the Google Home device, likely when they tried to scan it at a register. Huge retailers like Walmart and Best Buy usually receive items before they are released, likely with specific instructions as to when they are to be available for sale. But it appears that whoever stocked, tagged, and priced the Google Home units on the shelf was not aware of an actual release date. Google Home is the companys first home-assistant device which will let you control Philips hue, activate IFFTT recipes, play music from Google Play or Spotify, as well as answer questions with the Google search engine at its disposal. Youll also be able to control your Chromecast and ask it to play videos from YouTube, or TV shows and movies from Netflix.

The yacht is impressive, but not nearly as impressive as its owner. The 43-year-old has a net worth of US$36 billion (NZ$50 billion). His example is one many budding entrepreneurs could learn from. Billionaire's superyacht returns to New Zealand But first, some details about his superyacht Senses. Larry Page bought the 59-metre yacht from New Zealand businessman Sir Douglas Myers in 2011 for a reported US$45 million (NZ$62 million). Senses comes with a helipad, a Hobie Wave catamaran and a Herreshoff sloop. It has six decks and a gymnasium. Its interior was designed by famed French designer Phillipe Starc and it can accommodate 12 guests (in a master suite, two staterooms and two cabins). There is also room for 13 crew. Mr Page made his fortune after co-founding Google with Sergey Brin in 1998. He was a computer science student at Stanford University when he had a dream that inspired the idea for Google. He wondered whether there could be a way of downloading the entire world wide web and then just keeping the links. That led him to develop a way to rank web pages by how useful they were to people. Together with Mr Brin he developed the algorithm that created Google. Advice for entrepreneurs Mr Page's advice to budding entrepreneurs is to dream big. "Go big or go home" is one of his sayings. He believes one of the advantages of focusing on "mega ambitious" ideas is that there is little competition. Most people are playing safe. But he also believes that invention is not enough. You have to be able to commercialise your idea. He encourages staff at Google (and its parent company Alphabet) to take chances and to learn from their failures. His goals are certainly ambitious. There is the much talked-about Google self-driving car. He is also funding research into a flying car, surgical robots and even the search for immortality. Newshub.

Once WebAssembly, or wasm, matures and appears in browsers, it will allow developers to create native applications, and web applications with native code libraries, that run in browsers to deliver computationally complex content like streaming video, video editing, games, and virtual reality at high frame rates. Those backing WebAssembly claim the technology runs ~20x faster than JavaScript. Mozilla says its tests show WebAssembly running only 1.13 times slower than native speed. Similar efforts to make browsers better at handling native application code have been undertaken before, such as Google's Native Client technology and Mozilla's asm.js, a reduced set of JavaScript instructions tuned for speed. But these approaches haven't had broad support from all the major browser makers. WebAssembly, on the other hand, is driven by the W3C WebAssembly Community Group, and is backed not only by Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, but by Apple. Also, asm.js has some technical shortcomings like lack of SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) support to accelerate parallel processing. In a blog post last year introducing the technology, JavaScript creator Brendan Eich explained that while asm.js is great, it puts too much pressure on the JavaScript parser in mobile devices. "Transport compression is required and saves bandwidth, but decompression before parsing hurts," Eich said, while citing other issues. The WebAssembly Browser Preview is hidden at the moment. It's behind a flag in Google's V8 JavaScript engine and in Mozilla's SpiderMonkey. In Microsoft's case, it's only in internal development builds of the company's Chakra JavaScript engine. And while Apple did not join in the group announcement, Google reports that WebAssembly support is under development in WebKit's JavaScriptCore. Google and Mozilla are offering preview versions of WebAssembly to solicit feedback from developers on the design and implementation of the specification. The WebAssembly Community Group intends to publish an official specification in Q1 2017, after which WebAssembly is expected to start appearing in browsers. Mozilla said it plans to ship WebAssembly in Firefox 52 around March 2017. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 80 Comments More from The Register Mozilla wants woeful WoSign certs off the list Backdating SHA-1 certs is just not on 23 Comments Mozilla emits JavaScript debugger for Firefox and Chrome When it's easier to rewrite than refactor 7 Comments Mozilla plots TLS 1.3 future for Firefox Quicker handshake starts encrypting data sooner 7 Comments Mozilla's trying on seven hot new spring/summer logo looks LOGOWATCH Poll Seven new logo candidates run from Monsters Inc to completely mad 48 Comments Mozilla will patch zero-day Firefox bug to fizzle man-in-the-middle diddle Cert-pinning cockup can be exploited to identify Tor users What do Tor, Tails and Caddy have in common?

With big phones, it can be difficult to reach the top of the display. Now Google is doing something similar with Chrome on Android (via Android Police)… Through a new as-of-yet not public-facing feature called “Chrome Home,” users can now move the address bar, tab switcher, and settings menu from the top of the display to the bottom. It’s a pretty simple feature, but clearly, it isn’t finished yet. You can only access it on the dev version of Chrome on Android, and you have to use Chrome flags to enable it. Simply head to chrome://flags/#enable-chrome-home to enable the feature. Then relaunch and you’re good to go. As for the name, “Chrome Home,” it’s unclear what Google means by that. My colleague Abner suggests Google is just having a little fun, but I’d guess that it might have something to do with the relation to the home button. As happens often, though, we never quite know for sure what Google has in mind until they tell us themselves… Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

What are the three largest telephone companies in the United States, in terms of revenue? Go on. Use the internet if you want. That’s what it’s there for. OK … Now that I have you on edge, here are the answers: 1. AT&T. 2. Verizon. 3. CenturyLink. You have no doubt heard of AT&T and Verizon. You probably can’t go a day without seeing at least a couple of commercials for each. Chances are you’re a customer of one of them. You could even be on AT&T’s or Verizon’s wireless network and reading this column on your iPhone right now. And in that case: Thank you for reading and check out some our other fine business coverage. But … CenturyLink? You might have heard that name once in a while in an ad for business, or possibly, consumer telecom services. If, like me, you are a Seattle Seahawks fan, you definitely know the CenturyLink name because CenturyLink Field is where the Seahawks play their home games. But, let’s be honest, when it comes to telephone companies, CenturyLink is way down on the list of those in the average person’s consciousness. Yet, according to Forbes, CenturyLink is No. 3 in the U.S. based on its annual sales of $17.9 billion. So, now that you know what CenturyLink is, get ready to hear more about it. On Monday, Monroe, Louisiana-based CenturyLink said it would acquire Level 3 Communications in a deal valued at $34 billion. And if you haven’t heard of Level 3, you definitely have come into contact with the telecom-network operator at least once, because Level 3 is used by big network-traffic generators such as Netflix and Google to push their content across the internet and into your homes. Why are they joining up? Well, AT&T and Verizon aren’t getting any smaller. If CenturyLink wants to keep its toehold in the consumer market, where it provides internet, phone and even TV service — as well as offer better and faster services to its business customers — it needs to get all that network content closer to those who want to use it. Level 3 makes the kinds of technology that can drive that traffic faster and with fewer delays along the internet and corporate networks. It’s all about going on the offensive and showing businesses that you can haul what they need as fast as possible. And with the price tag involved, CenturyLink is saying to AT&T and others that the playing field in the telecom-network game is on a new level. Middle Innings: Fiber on Track Again? You might have seen last week where Google effectively put the kibosh on its Google Fiber initiative to roll out high-speed internet service. The decision by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which affected the Bay Area and other parts of the country, was initially seen as bringing an end to Google’s dreams of being a fiber-optic network operator. But … maybe those dreams are still alive? Late Friday, Bloomberg reported that Alphabet appointed longtime Larry Page associate and Google executive Jonathan Rosenberg to head up Alphabet’s Access business, which includes the company’s Google Fiber unit. Rosenberg joined Google back in 2002 and is viewed as a troubleshooter of sorts at the company, with a track record of taking poorly performing business operations and getting their financial houses in order. In late 2015, Rosenberg was said to have suggested spending at Alphabet’s Boston Dynamics robotics business needed to be restrained, and soon after Alphabet sought to sell the division.

In the Red: Decliners included Rocket Fuel, GoPro, SolarCity, Shoretel and SunPower The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index closed off by less than one point at 5,189.13. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.1 percent to finish the day at 18,142.42. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended the day at its breakeven point of 2,126.15.

The improvement comes from making use of Microsoft's Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) technology that Google implemented in Chrome 53 and 54. Profile Guided Optimization uses results of profiling test runs of a program to optimize source code before final compilation and distribution. Chrome is not the first web browser to support Profile Guided Optimization. An entry on the Mozilla Developer Network indicates that Firefox has been supporting PGO for builds since 2013. Chrome performance optimizations on Windows Google's use of Profile Guided Optimization on Windows builds of Chrome has the following effect on the browser: Startup time of Google Chrome: 16.8% faster. Page load time: 5.9% faster. New tab page load time: 14.8% faster. Google explains how PGO helped its developers create a faster browser on Windows: Chrome is a huge software project with more than a million functions in its source code. Not all functions are equal - some are called frequently, while others are rarely used. PGO uses data from runtime execution that track which functions are most common to guide optimization. To gather this data, the nightly build process now produces a special version of Chrome that tracks how often functions are used. PGO then optimizes those high-use functions for speed, in some cases increasing the binary size of those functions. To balance out that increase, PGO also optimizes less-used functions with smaller, though slightly slower code. These trade-offs result in higher overall performance, and a smaller overall code footprint. PGO also optimizes the memory location of the code, moving rarely-used functions away from frequently-used ones in memory.  This results in more optimal use of the CPU instruction cache by avoiding caching of less-used code, increasing overall performance. There are many other tricks that PGO uses to make Chrome faster, and they add up to great results. To explain it in simple terms: PGO analyzes how a test version of Chrome performs and tracks various functions to find out which functions are of high importance and which are not. It then provides those information to the actual build process of the Chrome browser that uses the information to optimize it. The 64-bit version of Google Chrome for Windows utilizes PGO since version 53, the 32-bit version of Chrome for Windows since version 54. While the improvement is significant from a statistical point of view, it is unclear if users will notice the improvements  unless Chrome's startup, page load time or new tab page load time was significantly slower than the average to begin with. Now You: Did you notice performance improvements when running Chrome?

It was already fast. Reply chesscanoe November 1, 2016 at 2:45 am # I switched from Chrome 54 x64 to Opera 41 x32 as my default browser, and for what I do, Opera seems faster in general. I have no formal benchmarks to prove this. But Opera remembers the last open tab prior to the active tab,and always makes it active when you close the current active tab. When you add to the bookmark bar, in Opera it's placed on the left, where I in fact want it. Opera's Speed Dial apparently holds as much as you care to define, and their order can be dragged to your preference. All the Chrome extensions I want work in Opera, and in one case work better than in Chrome. I look forward to Opera 42 x64 if and when it is released. I just hope is reasonably secure. I don't recall Opera offering a bounty to fix security flaws.

It sounds like pure paranoia, but that’s the gist of a debate that started on Twitter this weekend and quickly drew in some big names in Silicon Valley. Adam D’Angelo, Facebook’s former chief technology officer and founder of Quora, tweeted on Sunday he believes there’s a “good chance of major internet attack Nov 8th.” “Many groups have the ability and incentive. Maps outage alone could easily skew the election,” D’Angelo wrote. Put another way: If an organized group could somehow take down a service like Google Maps though a brute-force attack or security hole, perhaps it would prevent some voters from finding their voting locations. After all, many big services like Twitter, Netflix and Spotify suffered outages this month from a prolonged cyberattack. Such an attack might disproportionately affect “young people who rely on phones” and lean Democrat, at least according to D’Angelo. Many on Twitter dismissed D’Angelo’s comments as “conspiracy theories” that lacked “sources” to back it up, but one group appeared to take it surprisingly seriously: the tech industry. “Is there anything to be done about it?” Dustin Moskovitz, a Facebook cofounder and billionaire backer of Hillary Clinton, tweeted in response to D’Angelo. Mike Vernal, a venture capitalist at Sequoia, called it a “scary thought.” Elad Gil, a former Twitter exec, suggested it “would be great if major internet cos had maps available either in products or offline.” “There’s often chatter here and there [about election cybersecurity in Silicon Valley], but since Nov. 8 is so close, the volume has definitely turned up a bit,” says David Byttow, a former Google engineer and founder of Secret, who also joined the Twitter debate. Byttow tossed out other blockbuster targets that that would be particularly disruptive, including Google’s search engine (yes, Google again) and cell providers like AT&T and Verizon that connect millions to online services. “I think the chances of a large-scale orchestrated attack [are] very low,” Byttow added. “But, given all that’s at stake in this election and the seemingly unprecedented tensions that have been stirred up on all sides, I wouldn’t be surprised if it did happen.” Security experts mostly shrugged off the doomsday scenario as little more than tech execs getting carried away with themselves. “Silicon Valley is filled with smart people thinking to themselves, ‘If I was going to disrupt the election, what would I do?'” says Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne, which makes security software. In reality, it’s nearly impossible. Not only would the supposed group have to find a way to take down Google Maps, a difficult feat on its own, it would also have to interrupt competing mapping services from Apple or Yahoo to really cut off voters. “Taking down all three, I don’t think that’s terribly doable,” Grossman says. Even then, a voter could just call their local election board. That doesn’t necessarily mean all will be quiet online this Election Day, however. Another more likely scenario, according to security experts and some in the tech industry, is hackers would go after easier targets like news websites and prominent social media accounts to stop or distort the flow of information at pivotal moments that day. “It wouldn’t have the practical effect of preventing voting, but it could have the effect of making people feel the system isn’t under control,” says Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert at the Atlantic Council think tank. Byttow, the ex-Google engineer, agreed that “smaller scale attempts” are “much more likely.” Still, he sounded a cautionary note. “The best thing that people can do is have a plan for November 8th,” he says. “Have a set time and set a local reminder on their phone, take some screenshots of the directions to the polling location and keep their head down until they cast their ballot.” The latest theory on how Trump avoided paying taxes on nearly $1 billion How to get a Toyota Prius without paying for it Related Posts U.S. weekly jobless claims hit 42-year low China’s Wanda Group in talks to buy Dick Clark Productions Trump: Twitter helped me win but I’ll be ‘restrained’ now The Obamas made $436,065 in 2015 Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

In a Tweet sent out from his official account yesterday, Trump accused Google, Twitter, and Facebook of “burying” the recent news about Hilary Clinton. Last week, FBI Director James Comey said in a note to congressional committee chairs that the agency had discovered new emails relating to the investigation into Hilary Clinton’s private email server. On Sunday, Trump Tweeted: “Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!” Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2016 While many have pointed out the fact that the organizations Trump lists are tech companies and not media firms, it’s also been noted that the story was trending on the platforms. The investigation was Google News’ top item on Sunday. A source from the company told Mashable that it doesn’t change story rankings to influence user opinions. The investigation appeared to be equally as popular on Twitter, where it sat at the top of the microblogging site’s “Featured Tweets” section on Sunday morning. Facebook’s trending topics section was accused of routinely suppressing conservative news stories back in May, but the company was later cleared of any wrongdoings following an inquiry opened by the Senate Commerce Committee. The social network personalizes trending stories for each individual, so there are some who may not have seen the Clinton news in the module, but it was reportedly the top item for most users. The company directed inquiries to the CNN tweet below. .@brianstelter responds to Donald Trump's claim that social networks are "burying" the FBI's Clinton investigation https://t.co/ILEM2IR8Ws — CNN (@CNN) October 30, 2016 Related Reads Facebook co-founder pledges $20 million to help stop Donald Trump becoming president Now in Germany, Facebook, Google and Twitter will delete hate speech within 24 hours Twitter is testing a major redesign that borrows heavily from Facebook, Google+ 71 comments 279 interactions Now Read This… IMDb sues California to invalidate law that prohibits site from showing actors' ages Rogue One: A Star Wars Story international trailer reveals new content Watch the second official trailer for 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' Popular 16 comments The Best Smartphones: Google nails it 45 comments China says it will cut iPhone sales if Trump follows through on his trade war promise 8 comments Retailers reveal the price of the Nintendo Switch 10 comments Russia to investigate Microsoft, Kaspersky says Windows Defender is anti-competitive Load Comments 71 ...

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Eugene Volokh October 31 Follow @volokhc Several days ago, noted Internet lawyer Marc Randazza and his colleagues filed a lawsuit alleging that various defendants were misusing the court system to try to get online criticism deindexed by Google and other search engines. This isn’t the scheme that Paul Alan Levy and I wrote about, though it allegedly has a similar aim: It involves lawsuits filed by real lawyers against real defendants, but the question is whether the defendants are at all related to the posts that they allegedly wrote and that the plaintiffs (or the people behind the plaintiffs) want to see hidden online. (The people at Pissed Consumer first alleged it earlier this year.) Here are some excerpts from the complaint (or see the full complaint with the appendices, though it’s over 10 megabytes): INTRODUCTION 1. This case involves a creative solution to a common frustration for many businesses, who do not like negative reviews that are published about them on the Internet. However, removing consumer reviews from the Internet is a difficult process given that they are protected by the First Amendment. 2. Nevada Corporate Headquarters, has gone to great lengths to attempt to suppress consumer reviews in the past. It has filed at least one SLAPP suit in Nevada seeking injunctive relief to censor those negative reviews. In that case, Nevada Corporate Headquarters suffered a resounding loss when they were hit with an anti-SLAPP order. . . . They also lost at summary judgment in a SLAPP-back suit. That action resulted in a significant judgment for attorney fees and costs. . . . 3. Undaunted by these set-backs, Nevada Corporate Headquarters has now conspired with other companies and individuals to create a scam whereby they suppress negative reviews from the Internet, while evading any First Amendment or due process considerations. This scam also allows them to avoid the risk of another anti-SLAPP attorney fee award. 4. Several other businesses and professionals who have been the subject of negative reviews online have also employed the same fraudulent machinery as Nevada Corporate Headquarters, as a means of removing this content while evading detection and liability. 5. The scam is not all that complicated. Google will remove search engine results from its well-known search engine if it is provided with a court order determining that the information is indeed defamatory. 6. However, when Nevada Corporate Headquarters sued consumer review websites in the past, it was severely disappointed. (See Exhibits 1 & 2.) Therefore, they needed to concoct a new censorship scam. So they used a stooge plaintiff, ZCS Inc. (“ZCS”), to sue a stooge defendant, Collins Mattos (“Mattos”). 7. Defendant Doe Corporations, so called “reputation management companies,” conceived and organized the scam as an alternative way to remove negative posts in lieu of undergoing an adversarial proceeding. Several other businesses and professionals have contacted these “reputation management companies,” which have used similar schemes to remove negative consumer reviews about them. 8. The other conspirators engaged attorneys Mark W. Lapham (“Lapham”) and Owen T. Mascott (“Mascott”) to file sham lawsuits either by the subjects of the negative reviews or by corporations that had no interest in the allegedly defamatory statements, against a defendant who most certainly was not the party that published the allegedly defamatory statements, and the parties immediately stipulated to a judgment of injunctive relief, so the conspirators could provide the order to Google and other search engines, thus achieving the goal of deindexing all pages containing negative reviews. 9. At first blush, Defendants’ scam appears rather brilliant but incredibly unethical. Now that Plaintiff has uncovered and exposed Defendants’ unlawful deeds, Consumer Opinion LLC respectfully requests that this Court discipline them for those misdeeds. . . . 11. There are four categories of Defendants in this scheme: (1) the entities that file and/or benefit from the suit (the “Filing Defendants”); (2) the attorneys who knowingly and unethically file and prosecute these fraudulent lawsuits (the “Attorney Defendants”); (3) the “defendants” in these fake lawsuits who falsely claim to be the authors of allegedly defamatory statements (the “Stooge Defendants”); and (4) the “reputation management companies” that devised and carried out these schemes (the “RMC Defendants”). . . . FACTS SUPPORTING CLAIMS 35. Consumer Opinion LLC operates a website residing at the uniform resource locator (“URL”) <pissedconsumer.com> . 36. <pissedconsumer.com> is a consumer review website where individuals can share information about their experiences with businesses providing goods and services, thereby allowing consumers to make better choices between competing products and giving consumers an empowering and unbiased view of companies and products. 37. The First Amendment and various state anti-SLAPP statutes protect the right to publish opinions and true statements of fact. Therefore, aside from improving their business standards, there is little a company can do to prevent individuals from publishing negative opinions or true facts about them. 38. Moreover, under 47 U.S.C. § 230, providers of interactive computer services like <pissedconsumer.com> cannot be held liable for defamatory statements individuals post by and through their interactive services. 39. Understanding the difficulties of removing reviews consisting of negative opinions or statements of true fact, Defendants conspired to misuse California’s legal system to hide the unflattering statements from the consuming public by having popular search engines such as Google to deindex the webpages containing the comments. 40. RMC Defendants are “reputation management companies” that offer services to help individuals rehabilitate their on-line image. The Filing Defendants engaged RMC Defendants to achieve their goal of minimizing the impact of negative reviews on pissedconsumer.com. 41. RMC Defendants first identified individuals or entities willing to stand in the place of the professionals or businesses that were the actual subject of negative reviews on <pissedconsumer.com>. At this time Plaintiffs do not know if the nominal plaintiffs in the fake lawsuits had pre-existing relationships with the benefited parties of these lawsuits, or if they were simply engaged for the limited purpose of serving as the sham plaintiffs in the fake lawsuits. The conspirators likely understood that if the benefited parties brought the action in their own name, the scam was more likely to be discovered. 42. Next, RMC Defendants and Filing Defendants sought out someone willing to take responsibility for posting one or more of the allegedly defamatory comments. They found these individuals in the Stooge Defendants. 43. It is unclear whether Stooge Defendants were actually responsible for posting any of the allegedly defamatory statements at issue in any given fake lawsuit. However, it is clear that they were not responsible for posting all of the reviews on <pissedconsumer.com> and comments posted in response to the reviews. Nonetheless, in each case the conspirators successfully used the scheme to obtain an injunction ordering all of those reviews deindexed, which was precisely their goal. 44. It is also not clear what RMC Defendants and Filing Defendants offered the Stooge Defendants to secure their cooperation in their scheme to remove First Amendment protected reviews from pissedconsumer.com. 45. Of course, the conspirators required a cooperating attorney willing to file a bogus lawsuit on their behalf. Accordingly, they invited attorneys Mark W. Lapham, Esq. and Owen T. Mascott, Esq. to join the conspiracy. They accepted. 46. Like most review websites, the profitability of pissedconsumer.com is directly tied to the amount of traffic the website receives. Also, like most websites, individuals usually locate the website through the use of search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. 47. Many consumers considering the purchase of goods or services will search for information about a company prior to purchasing good or services by entering the name of the provider into a search engine. By causing the pages to be deindex, Defendants deprived consumers of information posted about the businesses and professionals benefited by these fake lawsuits, and thereby undermined the value of the <pissedconsumer.com> website to the consuming public. 48. Defendants’ actions caused further long term damage to pissedconsumer.com by limiting the usefulness of the website to obtain information about individuals and companies providing goods and services to the consuming public. The Mattos Case 49. ZCS, Inc. filed a bogus complaint against Collins Mattos in California Superior Court for Contra Costa County, claiming that Mattos had posted defamatory statements about ZCS, Inc./Nevada Corporate Headquarters on a consumer gripe website operated by Plaintiff Consumer Opinion LLC. (See Complaint in ZCS, Inc. v. Mattos, Case No. C16-00425 (hereinafter referred to as the “Mattos Case”), attached hereto as Exhibit 3.) 50. In reality, the statements at issue concerned only Nevada Corporate Headquarters. 51. Based on Nevada Corporate Headquarters’ unsuccessful attempts to remove reviews from Plaintiff’s website in the past, Defendants understood that Plaintiff would resist requests to have the statements removed, especially statements that had not been adjudicated to be defamatory. Therefore, instead of seeking removal of the statements, Nevada Corporate Headquarters conspired with ZCS and Collins Mattos to file a sham lawsuit for the sole purpose of entering a stipulated judgment and permanent injunction. According to the scheme, the conspirators then delivered a copy of the stipulated judgment to Google and other search engines demanding that they deindex all negative reviews about Nevada Corporate Headquarters. 52. Plaintiff is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Defendant Doe Corporation, operating as a reputation management company, conceived of the plan and organized the cooperation of ZCS, Collins Mattos, and Mark W. Lapham to bring the plan to fruition. 53. Defendant ZCS, Inc. is an inactive California Corporation. Plaintiffs are aware of no business operations of the company, other than standing in the place of Nevada Corporate Headquarters in the underlying litigation. Nevada Corporate Headquarters provides consulting services to businesses, including providing information and offering assistance with incorporating businesses. 54. Since September 2010, four individuals have posted complaints about Nevada Corporate Headquarters on pissedconsumer.com. Additionally, twenty-nine comments have been posted in response to those four complaints. The vast majority of the comments have been negative. 55. Plaintiff is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that at the bequest of Defendant Doe Corporation and with the full cooperation of Defendant Mattos, Mr. Lapham filed a complaint on behalf of ZCS, Inc. against Collins Mattos for defamation. (See Exhibit 3.) 56. In the underlying action the conspirators sought only injunctive relief. Specifically, the complaint requested an injunction that Collins be “prohibited from creating statements about Plaintiff or its officers, managers, employees, business partners, agents, servants, attorneys, representatives, products, goods or services, which defame, disparage, or contain libelous statements about Plaintiff,” and that Mr. Collins be “ordered to take all action, including but not limited to, requesting removal from the internet search engines including Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, of all defamatory, disparaging, libelous, and false statements about Plaintiff that Defendant has posted on the Internet.” 57. Curiously, the prayer for relief did not request an order directing Mr. Collins, to take all action to remove or request removal of the statements from <pissedconsumer.com>. The conspirators did not want to bring the scheme to the attention of anyone who would shine light on their unlawful actions. 58. Mr. Lapham filed the Complaint on March 2, 2016. 59. The next day, March 3, 2016, Mr. Lapham filed a Stipulation for Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction with the Superior Court. A true and complete copy of that Stipulation is attached hereto as Exhibit 4. 60. Having obtained a stipulated injunction from the Court, the conspirators then approached various search engines including, on information and belief, Google, Yahoo!, and Bing and requested that those search engines deindex the pages of <pissedconsumer.com>. Instead of limiting the deindexing to the pages that contained statements Mr. Collins claimed to have posted, the request to deindex included all web pages with entries about Nevada Corporate Headquarters. 61. By engaging in this scheme, Defendant Conspirators obtained a court order under false pretenses and used the court order to persuade popular search engines to deindex every statement about Nevada Corporate Headquarters, including the First Amendment protected statements of opinion and true fact posted by other individuals who were not a party to the underlying action. . . . [Details of the other cases omitted for space reasons — see the Complaint for more. -EV] FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Unlawful, Unfair, and Fraudulent Business Practice under California Business and Professions Code § 17200 (Against All Defendants) . . . 118. The acts and conduct of Defendants, and each of them as alleged above in this Complaint constitute unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent business acts or practices as defined by California Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq. . . . SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF Abuse of Process (Against All Defendants) . . . 124. Defendants did not file the above described actions for the purpose of determining the liability of the Stooge Defendnats or assessing an amount of damages. Rather, the Defendants filed the complaints for the purpose of obtaining a court order to serve on third party search engines such as Google in order to persuade those search engines to deindex portions of Plaintiff’s website. Defendants filed the actions to avoid the adversarial process ordinarily involved in litigation. 125. As a result of Defendants’ unlawful acts, Plaintiff Consumer Opinion LLC was damaged. Specifically, for a time when individuals searched for information about the beneficiaries of the fake lawsuits, search engines no longer produced any results indicating that consumers had posted information about the beneficiaries on the pissedconsumer.com website. Those consumers did not proceed to pissedconsumer.com and did not learn of the negative reviews. . . . THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF CIVIL CONSPIRACY (Against All Defendants) . . . 128. Defendants, and each of them, conspired, confederated, and colluded with the other defendants to engage in the above described scheme which constitutes a fraudulent and unfair business practice and an abuse of legal process to Defendants’ economic benefit and Plaintiff’s economic harm. . . . 134. Accordingly, all Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the actions of their co-conspirators. The initial complaint also included a case brought by a plaintiff called ADN, on behalf of Dan Newlin. But Newlin was then dropped from the complaint a few days after it was filed, because it turns out that he was the one who first alerted Pissed Consumer to what was going on. Newlin stated to me that the firm had “hired a reputation management company to monitor and help the firm’s online presence, which included search engine results,” but was then surprised to learn that a case had been filed — without the firm’s approval — to get the Pissed Consumer page deindexed. He then promptly told Pissed Consumer about this (Pissed Consumer confirms this) and also alerted Google as well. It is certainly possible that some of the other defendants likewise were unaware that the “reputation management” people whom they hired were filing such lawsuits on their behalf. opinions volokh-conspiracy Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

I'm betting that within the next 12 months or so, Google Fiber will be rebranded as Gigabit Google or just simply as Gigabit something-or-another, so it can cleanly rollout high-speed fixed wireless services without having to equate fiber to wireless. Speed and broadband service will be the discussion topics, rather than the actual physical medium. Fixed wireless service is seen by Google, AT&T, and Verizon as the Next Big Thing, providing gigabit speeds to consumers and small businesses without the capital expense of digging up roads and pulling fiber.  But it isn't clear if fixed wireless is going to be a big win, since it requires at a minimum line of sight (or close to it, depending on the frequency and scheme used) and some sort of external antenna.  Nobody has a clear picture yet of what installation will look like, but it is more than likely a truck roll with an installer drilling holes in the dwelling than a consumer point and plug-in, akin to today's small dish satellite TV installations. Underlying support for large scale gigabit fixed wireless will be fiber and plenty roof rights to deploy enough cells for covering an area. If anything, this puts Google at a disadvantage over incumbent cellular carriers in several ways.  Cellular companies already have established real estate in the form of both towers and roof rights, so adding fixed wireless to existing infrastructure starts as an overlay problem.  Google, on the other hand, has to shift its thinking to get cells deployed and is at a disadvantage because a lot of real estate they'd like to have is already being leased out at a premium by cell companies. It puts Google in the position of having to master a new way of doing things and create new facilities to support fixed wireless operations.  Can it do so at the same or more rapid pace than established carriers? It's a wait-and-see issue. But let's not forget the long game. Google will ultimately get bored and get out of broadband access. I'd look for its established fiber deployments and whatever future fixed wireless customers it obtains to be quietly shopped around in a couple of years to existing incumbent carriers along with CenturyLink, Frontier and Windstream. Frontier has never been shy in buying existing geographic franchises from Verizon, so it isn't a stretch to see them acquire Google Fiber facilities to expand and supplement its footprint.

Don’t forget to check out the First 15 Things You Should Do, and 40+ Pixel Tips & Tricks! After 6 somewhat turbulent years, the Nexus line is officially dead (for now). A shining example of what a pure Android experience had to offer consumers, the developer-friendly device never seemed to catch on the way Google wanted it to. We’re sure there are plenty of reasons behind this, but the biggest could have been that Google never really had full control of the Nexus. This year all of that changes with the first ever smartphone in Google’s newly launched “made by Google” brand — the Google Pixel. So, how is the Pixel any different from the Nexuses before it? Well, for one Google says they now have complete say in what goes into building the phone, something that wasn’t the case with the Nexus line. Software, design, hardware components — it’s all Google this time around. With everything now working harmoniously with each other, Google is able to build out a more complete vision of what they want in a smartphone and how it will best represent everything Google has to offer. This vision probably wont be fully realized until later Pixels (once Google can start creating their own mobile chips), but they’re already off to a great start. By building a top-tier smartphone, Google is not only trying to prove they have the chops to directly compete with Apple, but the best Android OEMs as well. This could very well be the best Android phone available and in our review, that’s something we aim to find out. HARDWARE Design and build quality With the exception of Samsung’s curved displays, it feels as though smartphone design, for the most part, has stagnated. Google certainly isn’t breaking new ground with the Pixel. We’re looking at the same cookie-cutter rectangle design we see on just about every phone. It’s safe, uninspired, and familiar. Some might even call it a tad boring. Equally sized thick bezels surround the display covered in 2.5D glass. Although the top bezel is where you’ll find the ambient light sensor, front facing camera, and cloth earpiece grill — the bottom bezel is apparently just there for looks. It’s slightly bigger than last year’s Nexus 5X only it doesn’t have the excuse of holding a front facing speaker, or even a fingerprint sensor. I assume this was a design decision to keep the phone symmetrical and not so it would more closely resemble the iPhone (although I’m leaning toward the latter). It’s on the back where we start to see a little more personality. When deciding whether glass or metal would make the most sense for a premium feeling flagship, Google just said, “Why not both?” The top half of Pixel is covered with silky smooth 2.5D glass that has a pearly luminescence to it with matching fingerprint sensor dead center. It doesn’t appear to be built from the same fortified glass as the front however, so it’s a little more susceptible to scratching. The larger bottom portion is all metal, separated by an antenna band. I’ve never been a big fan of chamfered edges (it looked great 5 years ago on the iPhone 4, but it’s time to move on) and would have preferred the fully rounded look of the iPhone 6/6S/7. But it is what it is. You do feel the razor cut precision of the chamfer when dragging your finger over the edge of the glass, something that was more apparent on the XL than the smaller-sized Pixel. Buttons have a nice clicky, tactile feel to them with a textured power button so you wont confuse it for the volume rocker. They’re not super hard like the HTC 10, but definitely harder to press than the mush that was the Nexus 6P’s buttons. The fingerprint sensor serves only one purpose: to read your fingerprints and does it with lightning quick precision. The more you use it, the more accurate it gets over time with less false reads, although it’s not quite as quick as the newer hardware sensors found on the OnePlus 3. Shouldn’t matter, we’re only talking a few hundred milliseconds here. As far as size goes, the regular Pixel is actually slightly smaller (less tall and wide) than even last year’s Nexus 5X, which I felt really hit the sweet spot. The XL is also lighter and all around smaller than the Nexus 6P, but slightly thicker too. This is thanks to it’s wedge shaped side profile, which gradually gets thicker toward the top. It’s only a about a millimeter and hardly discernible unless you’re looking for it. This hides what would have no doubt been a protruding camera lens, something Google poked fun at the iPhone for having during their announcement. Like most things, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and although I think the 2-tone look of the Pixel looks great from the back, others may not feel that way. I will say this, the reason Samsung is still using glass panels on the back of their devices isn’t because it feels more “premium” — there’s actual utility in it. Having a more fragile glass back allows you to include wireless charging in your phone, so it’s worth the trade-off in durability. I was hoping that with the inclusion of such a large back glass panel on the Pixel we’d see the return of wireless charging, but it’s just one of those legacy features Google has no intentions of supporting further. Bummer. Differences between the regular Pixel and the XL model are few. The XL has a larger, higher resolution display and higher capacity 3,450mAh battery, which makes it about $120 more expensive than the regular model. Other than that, the camera, processor, and performance between the two models remains the same. Unlike the latest iPhones (or last year’s Nexuses), don’t really have to sacrifice much by going with the smaller option. This is a breath of fresh air for Android purists who couldn’t stomach the 6-inch Nexuses Google was offering in years past. Critics will likely slam the Pixel for not featuring any sort of water resistance. It’s a somewhat glaring omission from a (high-priced) smartphone that’s supposed to compete with the latest iPhones and Galaxies. But complete lack of water resistance is somewhat of a misconception when it comes to the Pixel and most other devices which are built to withstand rain or a splash of water. It may not survive a dive to the bottom of a pool, but someone recently tested the phone by leaving it in a bowl of water for over 30 minutes. After it was dried off, the Pixel functional as normal. This should give you some peace of mind should the phone take a dive into the toilet or tub, but we wouldn’t tempt fate. While water resistance is a nice feature to have (who doesn’t want added peace of mind?), it’s hard to fault the phone for not having it. In fact, there are some benefits to not having high water resistance on a phone, like improved speaker quality. As someone who spends a great deal of his time watching the latest YouTube videos on the couch and less time by the pool, I’ll enjoying the added audio clarity that comes with a standard IP53 rating. Overall the Pixel feels no more premium as most other “all-metal” smartphones being churned out of Chinese factories in droves. I still wouldn’t say — based on feeling alone — it’s up there with the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, but it’s certainly close. And sometimes close is good enough. Display When building a high-end smartphone, you can’t cut corners when it comes to the display. It’s one of the first things people notice about a device and because of that, OEMs have long favored AMOLED when it comes to building a premium flagship. The Pixel is no different. Despite my own personal preferences (I’m a sucker for LG’s IPS panels), Google has done a great job at tuning the display to alleviate my biggest complaints with AMOLED: yellow whites, and overly dark blacks. The Pixel’s AMOLED display has been cooled up quite a bit, noticeably more than the Galaxy S7 Edge or the Nexus 6P that came before it. Although nowhere near that of LG’s IPS panels, it seems to fall somewhere in the middle. This is true for both the regular Pixel and the Pixel XL which share similar characteristics, despite the slightly lower resolution on the smaller Pixel. I would love to have the option to adjust the color temperature like we saw with the OnePlus 3 (or even a hidden developer option like on the Nexus 5X), but I suppose Google’s already done a good enough job for the most part. Yes, blacks are still infinite (this is AMOLED after all), but Google has tuned the gamma a bit to show a teensy bit more detail in darker areas of an image, making it much easier on the eyes. This is more apparent on the XL than the regular Pixel who have different displays, but whether you’re viewing photos or extremely dark TV shows, you should no trouble making out darker details on both — far better than the overly dark black levels on the S7 Edge. As always, you shouldn’t expect the most accurate color reproduction from devices using AMOLED displays and the Pixel is no different. Google says they’ve hit 100% of the NTSC color gamut, but if you want the most accurate colors, you still have the ability to switch over to sRGB mode via the Pixel’s hidden developer options. You probably wouldn’t want to, as the display loses all of its color pop and cool whites, but if you’re anal about editing photos, this is the way to go. As for the brightness, I’m not sure on exact nits, but when cranked all the way up to max brightness, the XL is far greater than the Nexus 6P — that much is certain. The regular Pixel doesn’t get quite as bright as the XL, although it’s pretty close. Viewing angles on the Pixel are fantastic, with only a 40% decrease in brightness at a 30-degree angle and colors that remain true. This absolutely destroys the Galaxy S7 Edge which, when tilted slightly, the entire display gets a weird green color hue to it. Auto brightness on both Pixels is sort of hit or miss, but works well for the most part. It’s nowhere near the level of the Galaxy S7 (or the cancelled Note 7 which had an ambient light sensor on the back), but It’s fine. It’ll do. The Pixel also gets a unique display feature — one we initially saw being tested in the Developer Preview for the Nexus 6P — called Night Light. Previously known as Night Mode, the setting gives the Pixel display an extremely warm tint, filtering out harsh blue light and similar to Apple’s “Night Shift” mode. It’s supposed to be much easier on the eyes and thus, doesn’t interfere with the brains natural sleep cycles. When put to use, it’s actually extremely impressive, giving the Pixel display an almost e-ink like appearance when it matched up with the warm incandescent lighting in your home. Storage No matter which size you opt for (regular or XL), the Google Pixel only comes in 2 storage configurations: 32GB or 128GB for $100 more. You may be asking yourself why no 64GB option? That’s a damn good question. Our guess is that Google assume you don’t really need it. You know, because everyone will be taking advantage of their new “cloud backup” feature which can help free up device storage by uploading apps, pictures and other media that you haven’t used in awhile to your Google Drive. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate having unlimited original quality backups with Google Photos, but even then 32GB still feels a bit restricting. To put it into context, 32GB only gives you 29.70GB after formatting, and even then 5.39GB is already being used by the system OS out of the box. That’s roughly 24GB of usable storage for all your apps (mine take up 6GB), 4K videos, photos, music, and whatever else you download from the internet. I don’t know about you, but for me, it’s only a little extra elbow room to work with. A 64GB for $50 more would have been nice option to have. It just feels as if Google is saying, “Oh, you’re one of those ‘traditional’ types who actually prefers keeping locally stored files on your device? Don’t appreciate our generosity? Fine. Here’s 128-freaking-gigabytes, now pay the eff up.” It’s just a little overkill and creates a gap in their storage configurations that shouldn’t be there. Miscellaneous There’s a handful of other hardware components that make up the Pixel, and although often overlooked in reviews, I felt deserved a mention. For one, the Pixel is one of a few handsets that comes SIM unlocked (no matter where you buy it) with support for all 4 major carriers here in the US. Everything from T-Mobile, to Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T — the Pixel supports all of their respective networks and even carrier specific features like T-Mobile’s WiFi Calling, HD Voice, Extended Range LTE, the whole nine. It’s hard to not factor this into the phone’s overall rating. Network support: GSM: Quad-band GSM UMTS/WCDMA: B 1/2/4/5/8 CDMA: BC0/BC1/BC10 TDS-CDMA: N/A FDD LTE: B 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30 TDD LTE: B 41 When it comes to audio, it seems much improved over previous gen Nexus devices (we’re sure it has everything to do with the new chipset). The quality is great, although using the in-phone equalizer still caps max volume to about 75%. We’re not sure why or how Google hasn’t addressed this on Android, seeing as how EQ settings work perfectly fine on the iPhone. There’s simply no reason they can’t on Android. Because there isn’t waterproofing on the Pixel, the speaker is loud and crisp, although it can get a little distorted at max volume. Unlike other, more courageous smartphones, the Pixel still has a 3.5mm headphone jack which is a nice addition, we just wish it wasn’t located on the top. The Pixel/XL is also the only Android device that can reliably hold a connection to the Pokemon GO Plus — using Bluetooth LE — whereas the handful of other devices I’ve tested (OnePlus 3, Honor 8, Galaxy S7, LG V2o) dropped the connection every few minutes. GPS seemed reliable enough, with no major issues or funny business. The Pixel is also one of the first devices to support Google’s new Daydream VR platform, although the headset isn’t yet available for us to include in this review. Be on the look out for one in the near future. Performance General performance is by far the number one reason to buy this phone. I don’t care what you think you know — you don’t know pure, unadulterated, high-octane speed that is the Google Pixel. On the Pixel and Pixel XL, the 2.15Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor shines, effortlessly speeding through apps, loading up videos, scrolling through the UI with little-to-no slowdowns or stutters. With high-speed UFS 2.0 handing storage, the Pixel is quite literally the fastest — and most consistent — Android device we’ve ever had the pleasure of using. For instance, apps stay in memory as long as they’re supposed to, so multitasking is instant. Sure the 4GB of RAM helps, but so does the fact that this is stock Android. That means you’ll no longer have to worry about bullsh*t custom versions of Android clearing out apps or being overly aggressive with memory management. Google knows best, and it’s exactly how they intended Android to work. There’s just something about returning to the phone hours and later and picking right back up from where you left off inside of apps. <insert pointless benchmark here> Further helping along the overall responsiveness of UI is improved touch latency, a commonly overlooked feature on most other Android devices. Thankfully, Google saw it as a way to further refine the user experience and the Pixel comes through in spades. Google says touch latency on the Pixel is the best of any Android device every produced, and while tough to test this without specialty hardware, I can confidently say it’s right up there with the iPhone’s. I’m still not quite sure if this is just a general improvement found in Android 7.1, or if Google is leveraging some of the phone’s unique hardware, although Tim Murray, the man heading Pixel’s performance team, says it’s a little bit of both. I will say, when rotating the phone from portrait to landscape (or vice versa), it still takes a full second for the rotation to kick in. Android has never been very good at this, but it’s 2016, this is absolutely unacceptable (especially considering how fast the Pixel is at doing everything else). I also found the fingerprint sensor a little slower at reading prints than newer hardware found on devices like the OnePlus 3. Even if it’s about half as fast, we are only talking milliseconds here, so most people wont even notice. To sum it all up, the Pixel’s performance is the result of hardware and software working together in perfect harmony. It’s really hard to overstate this, especially considering how many people are still hanging onto 2-year old devices, waiting to upgrade. I can guarantee you that upon first boot, you’ll notice the speed and responsiveness of the Pixel. More than that, it will spoil you and make returning to older devices feel like their internals are covered in molasses. There’s simply no going back after this. CAMERA By now we’ve all heard Google’s claims that the camera in Pixel and Pixel XL isn’t just one of the best smartphone cameras on the market — it’s the king of them all. So what’s so special about the Pixel? Well, on paper, the camera hardware is on par with most other offerings. The Pixel is equipped with a 12.3MP Sony IMX378 image sensor that features 1.55um pixels and an f/2.0 lens to help capture more light. While most manufacturers are hellbent on tackling mobile photography with bigger and badder hardware (higher megapickles, dual-cameras, OIS, etc), Google puts the focus on computational photography. Instead of working harder, Google is working smarter and Google’s finely tuned image processing where the Pixel truly shines. HDR+ The Pixel’s 3 different HDR+ modes: Off, Auto, On By default, the Pixel shoots in HDR+. It’s a lot like the HDR you’ve seen on other devices only it works a little different. Instead of taking multiple photos over/under exposed photos and combining them to produce a photo with higher dynamic range (something that takes time), HDR+ takes a handful of underexposed RAW photos in the background — as soon as you open the app — and combines them once you press the shutter button. The 3 different HDR+ modes in low light: Off, Auto, On On older versions of Google’s camera app, HDR+ was slow to capture a photo, but the low-light results more than made up for it. But Google finally figured out a way to make it instant (albeit, a little less dramatic), which is why it’s now on by default for the Pixel. There’s also a more extreme HDR+ mode called HDR+ On, which has a much more extreme effect, but slower capture speeds. HDR+ Off: Nothing being used HDR+ Auto (default): Balanced HDR, instant capture HDR+ On: Extreme HDR, slower capture Unfortunately, HDR+ doesn’t do much for lightening up shadows (something the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 excel at with their respective HDR modes), but it is what it is. A big advantage of using HDR+ for photos is that the camera doesn’t have to take a single loooong exposure like on other devices and a big reason why Google didn’t feel the need to include OIS on the Pixel — because they simply don’t need it. Well, the default camera app anyway. Video Like most other high-end devices these days, the Pixel is capable of shooting 4K UHD video. The difference is Google is using software tricks to keep the video steady — not OIS. You may think this wouldn’t be as nice a hardware solution, seeing as how traditional EIS zooms in on a video, sacrificing image clarity in an effort to smooth out shakes and jitters. The Pixel on the other hand uses a combination of the phone’s hardware (gyroscope) and software to help with the rolling shutter and smooth out video. There’s very little “jello” side-effect you see in other EIS solutions. While it works damn near perfect in outdoor daytime situations, it’s all but nullified in low light where the software has a difficult time figuring out what’s going on. Video with the front facing camera caps out at 1080p and although the quality is there, doesn’t seem to benefit from the same EIS as the rear camera. One of my favorite features with video capture is the option to pause in the middle of video, making it perfect for capturing an event, birthday, or wedding, without having to worry about splicing together clips after the fact. There’s also the ability to snap “photos” while recording video, but it’s just a screen cap of the video being recorded. All in all, video on the Pixel looks great. It’s clean, stable, and one of the best reasons to own the phone (providing you don’t shoot too much footage after dark). My biggest gripe with video on the Pixel has been audio quality, which is still quite average. Camera software Although the Pixel’s camera software isn’t anywhere near as robust as you’d find on devices like the Galaxy S7 or LG V20, it’s still a big upgrade from previous versions of the app. You wont find a “pro mode,” but the camera app now allows you to manually adjust white balance (presets) and or lock focus/exposure. Once AF/AE is activated (long pressing the view finder), you can manually adjust the exposure by sliding your finger up or down. It doesn’t give you a full range of exposure control, only 2 stops from where you initially locked it. Other available shooting modes include: Slow Motion – 240fps at 720p, or 120fps at 1080p Panorama – There are 4 options for shooting a panorama: Horizontal, vertical, big, or fisheye Photo Sphere – Capture a full, 360-degree image Lens Blur – Blur the background of an object to help create a shallow depth of field (also works with the front facing camera) The software — while a big improvement from previous versions of the app — is really nothing to write home about. It’s simple and intuitive enough, with a handful of “fun” features to help give it a leg up on the iPhone. The few manual controls available are nice, but we’re hoping it’s only the beginning. The only feature missing for me was an official Android alternative to Live Photos. It’s entirely possible I’m alone in this, but Live Photos are easily one of my favorite camera features from the iPhone. If there was ever going to be a proper Android alternative, the Pixel should have been the phone to introduce it. I mean, it’s already shooting off a million photos in the background thanks to HDR+ — why not give us the option to turn those into Live Photos? Camera performance Launch times are extremely quick. Tap on the camera icon and the app launches in almost no time flat. Google also added a handy shortcut where double tapping the power button can wake the phone and launch directly into the app. Fire off a shot too quick, however, and HDR+ Auto may not activate (remember, it takes about a second for the phone to buffer the background photos it needs for the HDR+ effect). When it comes to auto focus, the Pixel uses a combination of phase detection and laser auto focus for mostly stellar results. It’s quick and accurate in most of the time, just nowhere near the same ballpark as the Galaxy S7’s Dual Pixel auto focus. On the Pixel, you still get that annoying hunting (focusing in/out) when you move the camera around and it attempts to lock onto something. The Pixel can also fire off bursts of photos by holding the shutter button, choosing the photo it feels is the “best” of the bunch (along with 7 runner ups). It’s called Smartburst and although you wont get those HDR+ benefits by shooting this way, it could be helpful when attempting to capture a fast moving subject. Smartburst can also creation GIFs from these bursts, or allow you to create a collage, which is a nice touch. Camera issues Some phones have no issues with glare: iPhone 7 (left), Google Pixel (middle), and Honor 8 (right) My biggest issue with the Pixel camera was the excessive amount of lens flare that appeared in certain situations. I’m not just talking about when the camera was in direct light (that happens on every camera), but any time there was a sort of strong light source. This largely depends on the angle of the phone, so while sometimes you can simply reposition yourself, it’s not something you should have to think about. Google has acknowledged the hardware issue and seems confident enough that a future software update will fix — or at least help alleviate — some of this flaring you occasionally see popping up in shots. This is only when using HDR+ and, of course, only when using the default Google Camera app. Camera results For the first time it feels like Google is finally taking mobile photography seriously. While individual tastes may differ, there’s really no denying the results. From brightly lit environments, low light, to video stabilization and the like, the Pixel is a jack of all trades, and that’s largely thanks to HDR+. To see how the Pixel camera compares to other popular flagships, check out our Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7 Edge Camera Comparison. Yes, there are plenty of great options out there when shopping around for a great smartphone camera, but we can safely say — without a shadow of a doubt — the Pixel safely sits at the top of that list. Although it’s not by a huge margin, Google can finally say that for a brief moment in time, they had the best smartphone camera on the planet. Pixel Battery life Smartphone battery life is one of those things that’s always been tough to measure across the board. What I mean by that is, because there are so many variables (cell reception, apps installed, brightness, usage), battery life is rarely ever the same for any two people. Although I can’t say for certain what you’ll get from any specific device, I can give you my own personal experience having used each Pixel for a little over a week now. From what I’ve seen from most people’s reports, I tend to be a little on the extreme side of the spectrum, so at the very least, this is the minimum you can expect from the Pixel and Pixel XL. Before we get into it, I should note that I usually keep all my devices on at full brightness, have all background, location, and sync services enabled, usually connected to WiFi with light to moderate usage. That being said, I was consistently able to hit 4+ hours of screen on time with the Pixel XL, but barely 3 hours of screen on time with the regular Pixel before plugging in at 15%. So, while both phones could realistically take me throughout the day and well into the evening hours, only the XL gives you the peace of mind that you’ll always have more than enough juice before plugging in for the night. When compared against devices like my Nexus 6P (which was never that great too begin with), the XL far exceeded the 6P. The XL’s 3,450mAh battery even fared slightly better than what I was getting with the Galaxy S7 Edge’s 3,600mAh battery. As for the regular Pixel, it’s 2,770mAh battery was almost identical to the life I received from the HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 — two devices with slightly larger 3,000mAh batteries. Both the Pixel and Pixel feature Google’s Rapid Charging, using a standard USB 3.0 Type C cable and the included 5V/3A 9V/2A 18W adapter. Out the gate, it’s not quite as fast as fast charging methods like Quick Charge 3.0 or the OnePlus 3’s Dash Charging, but Google says you’ll be able to get 7 hours of usage from 15 minutes of charging. What that translates to in actual percentages (for both devices) is as follows: Pixel charging speeds (from 1%) 15 min: 25% 25 min: 44% 30 min: 52% 40 min: 60% 50 min: 69% 60 min: 78% 70 min: 87% 80 min: 93% 90 min: 96% 100 min: 98% 106 min: 100% Pixel XL charging speeds (from 1%) 15 min: 14% 20 min: 19% 30 min: 29% 40 min: 38% 50 min: 49% 60 min: 58% 70 min: 66% 80 min: 74% 90 min: 83% 100 min: 90% 110 min: 95% 120 min: 98% 124 min: 100% The above times indicate the best possible speeds, as testing was done while the screen was off and the phone wasn’t being used (charge currents can fluctuate based on temp and whether or not the screen is on/phone being used). You can expect slightly slower speeds in warmer environments, or when using 3rd party USB C cables or chargers. Software We covered just about every Android Nougat feature extensively in our 15 First Things and 40+ Tips and Tricks for the Google Pixel. When it comes to Nougat, by now you probably already know what to expect: enhanced notifications with quick reply, split-screen, improved Doze mode, and seamless updates. But that’s old news. Google’s Pixels are the first devices to hit the ground running with Android 7.1, the absolutely latest version of Nougat which is currently only available in Developer Preview form for Nexus devices. Android 7.1 brings a few new features like app shortcuts, Smart Storage, image upload from keyboards, circular icons, and a few other developer items. As so often is the case — especially when dealing with such a fresh, new Android release — the usual “only in supported apps” disclaimer applies for most core features. It will be awhile before developers update their apps to take advantage of the vast majority of these. In fact, even Google’s own device backup feature — new in Android 7.1 — is completely broken, failing to backup apps or their data for later restoring. Since switching to the new program, the Pixel wouldn’t even recognize my older device backups, something that was a huge inconvenience after Google somehow forgot which apps were installed on previous Android backups. But that seems to be the story with Android 7.1, at least this early in the game: it’s still half baked. As to be expected, the Pixels run a “stock” version of the Android OS. There are a few small design tweaks (like blue highlights instead of turquoise), but for the most part, it’s the same vanilla Android we know and love on Nexus devices. Okay, so the Pixel does gain a few exclusive features unique to Google’s new flagship line, like the new Pixel Launcher (which features a completely different UI from the Google Now Launcher on Nexuses) and Pixels are also the first devices to come out of the box with Google Assistant baked right in. Arguably the best part about the Pixel’s software is the lack of bloatware you find on most other devices. Out of the box, you’ll only find 19 apps pre-installed (20 if you count Hangouts, which is disabled by default), with Google recommending you download a few extras during the initial setup process. Here’s the full list: Pre-installed Pixel apps Calculator Calendar Camera Chrome Clock Contacts Downloads Drive Gmail Google Maps Messenger Phone Photos Play Movies & TV Play Music Play Store Settings YouTube Google’s optional apps: Allo Android Pay Docs Duo Keep Daydream Keyboard Google Assistant Although Google Assistant technically debuted in Allo (Google’s WhatsApp competitor), the Pixel is the first device where it’s officially baked in. It sounds like a bigger deal than it really is, as Assistant is slightly improved — more conversational — version of Google Voice Search. You can quickly access it at any time be holding down the home button, but 90% of what Google Assistant currently offers could already be done with Google Voice Search. Assistant is supposed to be more personal, pulling in user data for a more conversational approach to Google Voice Search. Think of it as Google’s answer to Siri. For instance, Assistant is supposed to remember the context of your original question, allowing you to followup with additional queries in a natural, conversational way. Well, in theory anyway. In practice, Google Assistant is still pretty dumb for the most part. It can’t read you SMS messages, can’t identify songs, can’t show you shopping lists. You can play a quiz show though, which is an interesting touch. Of course, Google promises that over time, it will get better. With actual writers penning Assistant’s dialog scripts, it’s entirely possible. In its current state, Assistant isn’t going to be moving Pixel units for Google. Fingerprint Gestures We were surprised to find the addition of fingerprint sensor gestures on the Pixel. When enabled, you can simply swipe your finger down on the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notification shade. This is by no means an original idea, as we’ve seen something nearly identical on Huawei devices like the honor 5X — but incredibly useful when dealing with the larger Pixel XL. Unlimited original quality photo backups The fact that the Pixel offers unlimited — original quality — photo and video backups is a huge perk for anyone thinking about picking up the phone. It’s not that Google’s cloud storage options are even that expensive, it’s just that most people don’t want to bother paying monthly for cloud backups, especially when the high-quality free option exists (I’ll admit, I’m guilty of this). But the Pixel takes such excellent photos and video, the best way to preserve all those special moments is in their original quality. 24/7 Tech Support When building an iPhone competitor, no matter how great your phone is, it’s hard to compete with Apple’s customer service. For some, you simply can’t put a price tag on support, which is why Google did the next best thing: they baked it into the OS. In the device Settings, there’s now a tab where Pixel owners can get 24/7 support via chat or phone. Whether you just need help figuring out how to perform a specific task, or you’re. When it comes to actual device repairs, Google has partnered with the mobile phone repair store uBreakiFix to offer official HTC OEM replacement displays (or metal housings) in the event yours ever is ever damaged. Pricing is $130 for a new display and with thousands of brick and mortar stores nationwide, there’s a good chance there’s a location near you. Quick Switch Adapter Moving all your stuff from an old smartphone to a new one is rarely (if ever) a carefree experience.Taking much of the frustration out of this experience is Google’s Quick Switch Adapter, a tiny dongle that comes bundled with each and every Pixel. The QSA allows you to plug your old smartphone directly into the Pixel, transferring over most of your old data like photos, SMS messages, etc. — even if you’re coming from an iPhone. The whole process is relatively straight forward. Just use the USB cable from your old device and plug it into the adapter. Then, after connecting the adapter into the Pixel, plug it into your old device and follow the steps on-screen to begin moving your old stuff on over. Not everything carriers over and while you can already restore wireless from an old Android, is probably better suited for ex-iOS users who may not have been using many Google services to begin with. For more on making the switch from iOS to the Pixel using the Quick Switch Adapter, check out our complete tutorial here. Software update guarantee As with the Nexus devices that came before it, one of the main benefits of buying a Google flagship is its software support. Because these are, in fact, Google devices, you can expect regular software updates — both maintenance and security — in line with something like the iPhone. Whereas other devices have to wait around months/years for a single major Android firmware upgrade, you can rest assured your Pixel will have the latest software as soon as it becomes available. Google guarantees at least two years of OS upgrades and three years of security updates from launch. For those that don’t mind living on the bleeding edge, there’s also the Android Beta Program where you can test upcoming Android releases before anyone else. Google hasn’t confirmed that Pixel devices will be allowed to participate, but we can assume given it’s an in-house project. What’s missing Because we’re dealing with “stock” Android, that means you lose out on a lot of the added features you find in the custom versions of Android that come on devices like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5. Although we’re fine on giving up most of these, features like the always-on display, ambient wake (by gesturing your hand over the display), or double tap to wake are so incredibly convenient for quickly checking notifications (without having to pick up your phone), you would think they’d be added into Android proper by now. Also worth noting is that not all Pixels are created equal. Although the models you can purchase from the Google Store or Best Buy both feature an easily unlockable bootloader, Verizon’s model is a little more locked down. This will only be a concern of those that like to tinker around and root their devices, although a root exploit for the Verizon model has already been discovered. Conclusion The Pixel is Google’s best effort yet at creating their own version of the iPhone. It’s something that simply wasn’t possible under the old Nexus brand. It’s not so much what the Pixel offers, so much as what it represents. Google is no longer watching Android from the sidelines as it’s bastardized by their hardware partners and skinned to look like anything but the OS they built. They know that the only way to truly have full control over the OS, is by having equal amount of control over that hardware it’s running on. By having full control over both hardware and software, it allows Google the freedom to showcase Android in a way we haven’t been seeing from their partners. This isn’t someone else’s bad interpretation of Android. There’s no gaudy skins, superfluous features, and nobody is dragging their feet when it comes to software updates. The Pixel is just as much Google’s answer to the iPhone as it is the Galaxies and Huawei’s. Is the Pixel perfect? No. You might even say there’s a lot missing here too. There’s no water resistance, it’s not modular, there’s no front facing speakers, it’s only has one display and it doesn’t even wrap around the phone — oh well. There’s a hundred other devices that can do all of those things and you know what? Nobody is buying them. The Pixel offers top notch hardware but it isn’t just a sum of its parts. It’s not just the fact that they included the Snapdragon 821 that makes it great — it’s how they fully leveraged said processor in things like the camera app. It’s not just the fact that they included an AMOLED display — it’s how they tuned it so you can still see details in dark photos and videos. It’s not that the Pixel is running Android 7.1 Nougat (months before anyone else) — it’s how Google has optimized the OS in a way that it will likely run better now than anything currently out there or coming down the line. Yes, the Pixel is expensive. It’s meant to be. You can find an Android device that’s cheaper and although it may have comparable specs, all that goes out the window when looking at the experience they offer. Bloatware, bugs, inconsistent support, muddled UIs — all of these things take away from the core user experience, something that doesn’t just hurt manufacturers, it hurts Android as whole. The Pixel is monumentally important to Google. Android head Hiroshi Lockheimer recently tweeted that October 4th (the day the Pixels, Google Home, and Daydream were unveiled), would be equally as huge for Google as the first day Android was released. The Pixel represents Google’s perfect vision for Android and even if that’s not fully realized with their first attempt, Google sought out to create a premium, minimal, zero-gimmicks iPhone competitor and that’s exactly what they did. Simply put, the Pixel is the best Android experience you can get right now, bar-freaking-none. Google Pixel Rating: star_fullstar_fullstar_fullstar_fullstar_75 (4.9 / 5) The Good It’s fast as balls Camera output is otherworldly Best front facing camera on a smartphone Same performance for small and XL models Display is tuned perfectly Fantastic battery life (XL model) The Bad Bezels are stupid big No 64GB model Battery life (regular model) Limited color options Excessive camera glare issue No wireless charging (despite half-glass back) No extreme water resistance The Bottom Line A friend of mind once told me that if you want to find a good pizza place, the best way is to order just a plain cheese pizza — no toppings. If a place can nail down the basics, you know that anything else you throw on top is just a bonus. That’s how you judge a quality. The same could be said about the Pixel. There’s no fluff. No gimmicky features to hide behind. Google wanted a smartphone — designed to their exact specifications — that could go toe-to-toe with the iPhone, not just with hardware, but the overall experience it offers. With the Pixel, they’ve done just that. After using it for a little more than a week now it has become so clear. This is the reason Google is making their own phone. This is way Android should be experienced.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps BREAKING NEWS Live updates: Yesterday, you couldn't come to town, today you can't leave. Chaos in capital ... read more Google tries new approach with voice assistant Last updated 10:10, November 1 2016 Reuters Google released its Pixel phones last month. About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Google, which crashed Apple's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 per cent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google's Android operating system. READ MORE: * Living with gadgets that can talk * 'Iron Man' wants to voice Mark Zuckerberg's virtual assistant Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft Corp's Cortana. "We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information," Rakowski said in an interview. LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. Ad Feedback The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colourful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button." The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words "OK Google". By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google "doesn't have to do negotiations with another handset maker - they can make it as tight as they want," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. "If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator," said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. "They will be relegated to just pushing hardware." Google is coy about its plans. "Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible," Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company's earnings call last week. "The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience," he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie," he said. "I approach this the same way."  - Reuters Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: Review: MacBook Pro Technology Homepage technology headlines Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home spotted in a Walmart store before market release By R Padla - October 31, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Your home is about to get smarter and more “wired” as Google Home is now available from Walmart. Well, it’s not yet official but the device has been sighted on the retail store even before the commercial launch. We’re guessing some employee made an honest mistake of putting the units on the shelves. That’s interesting since a Xiaomi Mi box was only spotted in a Walmart branch ahead of official market availability. Official release of the Google Home is November 4. Walmart already has the product so we know the scheduled release will be followed. Thing is, Walmart went ahead. Interestingly, the product isn’t available for sale yet when the source of this story tried to buy one. Google Home costs $129. We know Google is slowly moving the Google Cast system to Google Home. We also know it can be integrated with Spotify and other similar apps. Google Home with the Google Assistant directly rivals Amazon Echo and Alexa. Alexa may be more popular these days, being integrated with several products and services left and right, but the Google Assistant is more widely used. There’s also the fact that it’s from Google so the search function will be relevant and accurate. Google Home is also expected to be integrated with other services and products especially that it’s finally integrated with IFTTT and a channel is now open.

Google today announced it is rolling out improved detection and filtering systems to prevent manipulation on Google Play and "protect the integrity of the store." Writing on the Android Developers Blog, Google Search Quality Analyst Kazushi Nagayama and Product Manager Andrew Ahn said developers sometimes use fraudulent installs, fake reviews, and incentivized ratings to manipulate the placement of their apps in the store. The improved detection and filtering systems are intended to cut down on that. "If an install is conducted with the intention to manipulate an app's placement on Google Play, our systems will detect and filter it," Nagayama and Ahn wrote. "Furthermore, developers who continue to exhibit such behaviors could have their apps taken down from Google Play." They added that this type of manipulation violates the Google Play developer policy and harms other developers by hindering their changes of being discovered or recommended. //Related Articles The 100 Best Android Apps of 2016 "Ultimately, they put the end users at risk of making wrong decisions based on inaccurate, unauthentic information," Nagayama and Ahn wrote. "These important changes will help protect the integrity of Google Play, our developer community, and ultimately our end user." They didn't go into detail about the new systems, but said that in the "vast majority of cases, no action will be needed." They advised developers who are working with a third-party marketing agencies to ensure any promotions for their app are "based on legitimate practices." Check out Google's Developer Support Resources for more information. This issue made headlines late last year when Bell Canada was slapped with a $1.25 million CAD fine (about $969,330 US) from Canada's Competition Bureau after posting fake reviews in the App Store and Google Play to boost the rankings of its free MyBell Mobile and Virgin My Account apps. Meanwhile, BlackBerry in 2013 was accused of posting fake reviews of BBM for Android to bolster its ratings, though the company denied those claims.

Even though the voice-based virtual assistant has received praise for its ability to carry a conversation while keeping earlier messages in mind, there are some new features that are still being discovered by users. Now, a user has found out that the Assistant makes it easier to share articles that you are currently reading to Twitter and Google+. Google+ user Corey Stock, as pointed out by 9to5Google, discovered that you can share the articles by giving a voice command to the Assistant while reading them. However, 9to5Google has found out the feature works for only Twitter and Google+ as of now, it was not able to work on other services such as Facebook, Allo, Hangouts, or Gmail.In order to share the articles using Assistant, users need to say, "OK Google, share this with Google Plus" when browsing an article on their Pixel phones. The Assistant then automatically transcribes the title and the link. There are many reviewers who have termed Assistant to be a better and more intelligent virtual assistant than Apple's Siri. It remains to be seen how Apple will improve Siri from here onwards.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Google Glass: Not the failure it's made out to be? By Rick Delgado Published 4 weeks ago 12 Comments Tweet Failure. Disaster. Flop. These are just a few of the words used to describe Google’s foray into wearable and augmented reality technology known as Google Glass. When the first videos of Google Glass were released to the public, they sparked the imaginations of millions. Many began to dream up fascinating new applications for this innovative technology. Just think of how it would impact businesses! How would our everyday lives change with this powerful device going with us wherever we went? The possibilities were staggering, and a revolutionary change in how the world works appeared to be right around the corner. As we now know, Google Glass is little more than a footnote. From the way most tech blogs describe it, Google’s amazing new device failed to live up to expectations. It never caught on with businesses or the public at large, and the result was a disaster the likes of which Google isn’t familiar with. In fact, many websites are urging companies pushing similar devices to do everything they can to avoid Google Glass’s mistakes. If there’s one thing to learn from the Google Glass phenomenon, it’s that Google struck out with this attempt. But could the popular perception of Google Glass be missing the point? It turns out that many people may have gotten the wrong idea of what Google was trying to do with its Glass product. A combination of mistaken media stories, common misperceptions, and poor communication have likely contributed to the idea that Google Glass was a failure of Betamax proportions. The tide may be turning on opinion regarding Google’s wearable attempt, and history may be a little kinder toward those strange looking glasses tech geeks were wearing for a time. This noticeable shift in opinion over the Google Glass has in part been driven by a push to understand what Google was trying to accomplish with it in the first place. Many of the shortcomings and criticisms people lobbed at Google Glass can actually be answered once you know that what we saw from the product was really only Google’s Explorer program. Yes, Google Glass was expensive, thus severely limiting the number of people who could buy it. Yes, its capabilities were not clearly defined and made using it pretty difficult at times. Again, that was all intentional on Google’s part. The tech company wanted the first adopters of Google Glass to be a sort of test audience. They wanted to see what people would do with the product and keep the feedback in mind for future projects. Based off of this research, Google would be able to develop other products. In other words, the Google Glass we saw was more of a trial run, a beta that was never going to be released to mass audiences at all. That’s why we never saw Google Glass released as a standalone product made available in stores. When Google revealed the Explorer project was coming to an end in early 2015, many people quickly proclaimed Google Glass a miserable failure. What they didn’t realize was that Google was transitioning into a new phase -- the enterprise version of the device. This new and improved Google Glass is being made for businesses and industries for them to use, and for now, it is seeing success. From its use in the airplane manufacturing process to helping people with autism, Google Glass has gotten a new lease on life thanks to improvements made through that initial experimental phase. The more it catches on among larger enterprises, the more likely it will eventually be made into a consumer version. Even if Google Glass itself were never to see the light of day again, that doesn’t mean it can be declared a failure. After all, innovation often requires failure along the way, leading to the very breakthroughs that can be deemed giant successes. The technology used in Google Glass is already being put to use in other devices, like smart contact lenses and new camera technologies. If anything, Google Glass can be considered a pioneer in the field of wearable smart devices, a needed trailblazer that paved the way for other gadgets and modular solutions that will play important roles in our lives in the future. While it may be popular to kick Google Glass around, Google may actually have the last laugh.

This will affect apps that use methods like fraudulent installs, fake reviews, and incentivized ratings, the company noted. Why advertise with us? Related Update Nexus 5 with Android Nougat via CyanogenMod CM 14.1 custom ROM [How to install] Google Pixel phone series hit with Bluetooth pairing bug TechRadar reported that while Google already had technology it used to detect these sorts of manipulation attempts, the new system is a step forward in terms of its accuracy. When it detects an app that has moved up the charts through ill-gotten means, the system will filter it. In addition, developers who continue to engage in these practices will have their apps taken down from Google Play. Writing on the Android Developers blog, Google Search Quality Analyst Kazushi Nagayama and Product Manager Andrew Ahn said developers sometimes use fraudulent installs, fake reviews, and incentivized ratings to manipulate the placement of their apps in the store. The improved detection and filtering systems are intended to cut down on that. "If an install is conducted with the intention to manipulate an app's placement on Google Play, our systems will detect and filter it," Nagayama and Ahn wrote. "Furthermore, developers who continue to exhibit such behaviors could have their apps taken down from Google Play." They added that this type of manipulation violates the Google Play developer policy and harms other developers by hindering their changes of being discovered or recommended.

By Erik Spanberg October 31, 2016 Save for later Saved Scott Keneally About video ads View Caption of In 2011, Nicholas Carr summed up Facebook’s business model like this: “The desire for privacy is strong; vanity is stronger.” Carr spent the past dozen or so years making similar proclamations of high-tech heresy, questioning and often criticizing Silicon Valley billionaires and their armies of engineers and programmers for casting rapacious greed and manic, time-sucking online distractions as beneficial beacons of inevitable progress. Carr's new book, Utopia is Creepy ($26.95, W.W. Norton, 360 pages), is somewhat of a greatest-hits album. And, yes, album would be the proper term, since one of Carr’s peeves is the insistence by some that the streaming, track-by-track music delivery of today improves upon the full-album experience of yesteryear. Carr’s album includes the hits (“Is Google Making Us Stupid?”), a bonus track (“The Daedalus Mission”), and chapters and posts from his previous bestsellers and his Rough Type blog. Recommended: Famous last words: Take our literature quiz! What makes Carr effective is that he’s an ambivalent contrarian. He doesn’t live off the grid (is such a thing even possible?), he acknowledges his own irrational behavior at the mercy of smartphones and hyperlinks, and he wrestles with the blithe signing away of much of our privacy and existence during the so-called Web 2.0 era of social media. Test your knowledge Famous last words: Take our literature quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 Many times, Carr serves us all by stepping back and taking stock of what computers are – and aren’t. They’re tools for doing tasks, he writes, but they are not, and cannot ever be, infallible forces for bettering our world. And, in some cases, perhaps many, the latest may not be the greatest. “What makes one tool superior to another has nothing to do with how new it is,” Carr writes. Social media, in similar fashion, may have many attributes and uses, but it is not something that increases or leads to democracy or better government. And, almost invariably, whatever it is Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and other tech giants are offering to ease and connect their users’ lives, the goal isn’t a better world but a more profitable one and more time spent checking texts and posts and links and emails. There’s a reason Apple has its world headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop. These sound like simple observations, and they are, but few of us bother to consider such notions while pulling our phones from our pockets over and over for another injection of what turns out to be mostly ephemeral updates and disposable information. Carr is here to remind us — and to take a longer-term view of how we got here. As he writes in his introduction, “The greatest of America’s homegrown religions – greater than Jehovah’s Witnesses, greater than the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, greater even than Scientology – is the religion of technology.” In the 1800s, philosophers and cultural critics crowed over technological advances and how society would be improved and perfected through constant innovation. Again and again, changes in media, from the arrival of the record and radio to the advent of TV and the Internet, were met with pronouncements that universities and schools would be utterly transformed, rendering the traditional model of teachers and students gathered in a classroom as all but obsolete. Yet Harvard and Yale and Stanford and Cal, not to mention Florida State, Montana State, and Georgia Tech, among many others, still seem to have campuses intact. Remember a few years ago when the Kindle spelled the end of physical books? E-book sales have leveled off and most people still favor hardbacks and paperbacks. Carr isn’t trying to argue that we’re dropping digital and going all-analog, and if he tried, it would be ridiculous. What he is doing is lending perspective on what our insatiable infatuation with iPhones and Androids and Galaxies is doing to us and asking whether we might want to put some moderation in our digital diets. Carr spoke with me this week about “Utopia is Creepy” and the constant craving to hit the refresh button. Excerpts from our conversation are below. Q. You write that “smartphones have made media machines of us all,” but we are without empowerment and reflectiveness.” What do you think it might take to change us, if it’s possible to change us? The first thing that would be required to change the state of affairs is people beginning to not only question the influence of smartphones and related technologies over us, but actually changing their behavior. And as we all now know, that’s very difficult. Because even if you have some worries about the way your smartphone determined your behavior and your attention and the way your mind works over the course of the day, the services that we crave through a smartphone are designed to play into a very deep instinct that we have to want to know anything new that’s going on in the environment around us. Through notifications and alerts and this kind of perpetual worry that there might be some new message that we haven’t seen yet, that keeps us enslaved to the phone. We’ve kind of accepted that and, in order to change, we’d have to change our own behavior, which I think would ultimately change the way these services are designed. But until we really do change our behavior, I don’t think any other force will change the situation. Q. Have you seen these gag products that do nothing ( The Wall Street Journal wrote about empty plastic NoPhones last month) and some people going to flip phones? There are small pockets of rebellion out there.… There are definitely attempts by both users and designers of the technology to go down a different path. We see that with some people exchanging their smartphones for so-called dumb phones and we see it with certain software designers who are trying to create less-distracting interfaces, more uni-tasking services than multi-tasking services. And I think that’s great. It also shows us there is a broader anxiety among the public about the way we use our technology and how it might not be in our best interest, this obsessive-compulsive attachment to our phones, but both the concerns and the actions are still at the periphery of the culture. Q. I’m wondering whether you ever feel personally the way I feel when I’m checking my phone, which is, what am I looking for? Absolutely, because a lot of my writing comes out of my own experience. And I see through my own behavior this kind of strange, compulsive desire to discover what is predictably trivial. And even less than trivial. I think science shows us this is truly an instinct, there is this compulsion we have to not let any little change, new piece of information float by without it grabbing our attention for a second. And I do think companies like Facebook and other social media companies know very deeply how this works and design their services to play into that instinct. Q. You make the observation in one of your essays that we view computers as infallible and neglect to recognize that they are human-built and prone to hacking, bugs and other malfunctions. Why do you think we have so constantly elevated technology to god-like status? It’s a theme that has been running through American culture for a couple of hundred years now, this desire to define progress as technological rather than to see technology as one tool to promote social and cultural progress. I think it is tied up in the American psyche, this sense that there are shortcuts to progress. And that if we simply put our faith in technology, then we don’t really have to deal with the challenges and difficulties and complexities that are truly involved in pursuing progress. It also ties into our love of novelty. In one sense, that’s healthy because it does inspire inventors and entrepreneurs to push things forward, but it becomes counterproductive when it blinds us to the negative consequences of the technology. Too often, we allow our enthusiasm to overwhelm any kind of skepticism and that’s when we start to adopt technologies that aren’t in our best interest. Q. (In 2012) you made a comparison of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to what you called a hierarchy of innovations, making the point that recent innovations haven’t been as transformative. How did people respond to that? It did get a lot of reaction, both in its original form, as a blog post, and then also The Wall Street Journal asked me to condense the piece into a short op-ed. It did seem to strike a chord and one of the reasons, I think, is because there has been a lot of discussion, a lot of debate about whether innovation has become trivialized through Silicon Valley. And there are two very different beliefs on that count. One is that we’ve never been more innovative and this is the golden age of technology and progress. And then there’s the other side held by many people, including some inside Silicon Valley, that we’re in what one person calls an innovation desert. Where we’re not seeing the huge, society-changing technological advances we saw a hundred years ago – where we had electrification and the arrival of the automobile and air conditioning, things that changed the way people lived – and I have sympathy for both of those views. Because there seems to be more investment and more interest in innovation than ever before and yet a lot of the innovation seems trivial — features on apps for social media. That led me to this different kind of conclusion that what’s really changed are people’s needs, which are much more self-absorbed and so our innovators cater to our needs. Entrepreneurs and innovators are going to respond to needs. Q. Given that, would Edison be working on emojis, were he around today? I think he may well have [laughs]. Because Edison was very much in tune with looking very carefully at society and figuring out, what are the gaps here that I can fill. I wrote a book about Edison’s role developing the electrical grid or utility and he was on some trip out West and he saw a bunch of people working with jackhammers and he had this idea that rather than power each machine individually, maybe you could create a network for electricity to be delivered wherever it’s needed. Lots of inventors try to figure out what are people yearning for and, today, if you want to get famous and rich as an inventor, the best way is to create some little app that Facebook will buy. Q. You mention in the book that you like gizmos, you aren’t a Luddite, but when you spend so much time writing about the deleterious effects of computers and smartphones, how does that affect your ability to enjoy those things? It probably hampers it because I have grown quite skeptical about technology. If there’s one way I’ve tried to change my personal behavior, it’s that I used to be very much an enthusiast about new technologies and the latest software. Now I try to approach these things with a skeptical viewpoint and say, how is this ultimately going to change my life and is it going to be a change for the better or a change for the worse? But I think ultimately it’s a healthier way to approach technology because it makes the technology subservient to something bigger rather than being the end-all of your existence. Q. Are you on Twitter, are you on Facebook, are you on Snapchat — what do you use in social media? It became clear to me that the social networking and social media services, for all the benefits that they have, and I don’t deny their charms, but they are very much designed to keep us perpetually distracted, perpetually looking at our screen, they intrude into our intellectual and social existence. If you look at the statistics, every few minutes during our waking hours, for a lot of people (they are checking for updates). The very first thing they look at when they wake up is their smartphone and the last thing they look at when they go to bed. I’m not on Facebook, I have a Twitter account, but I just use it to promote my blog posts, I’m on Instagram, but just with a few people, I don’t do Snapchat. So I’ve tried to avoid (a lot of participation) because I know I’m susceptible to this kind of compulsive behavior. And you do lose something. If all your friends and family are on Facebook, then you’re out of the loop. Q. How has social media affected the current campaign, especially given Donald Trump’s incessant tweets? It’s had a big effect. There’s a piece called “The Snapchat Candidate” [in the book] that I wrote for Politico last year during the primaries and I argue that media does affect political discourse. Over the last 100 years, there’s been three big changes: first was radio in the 1920s, next was television in the 1960s, and right now we’re seeing the way Twitter and Facebook and other social media does alter the way campaigns are conducted and what we expect from candidates. You saw it with the rise of Trump, which was fueled by Twitter and by social media and it very much suited his essential identity as this kind of provocation machines that could pump out these little tweets and get lots of attention. The whole political discourse began to be influenced by these provocative tweets. … The idea of being a substantial person has faded away a bit. Q. Of the major modern tech barons – Jobs and Gates and Bezos and Zuckerberg and so on – which, if any of them, do you admire the most and why? That’s a good question. I admire many qualities of Jobs because he looked at computer technology as a tool that people could use in ways that could expand their minds and their opportunities, which I think is the best way to view tools. Whereas a lot of the more recent big names in Silicon Valley – Zuckerberg, Larry Page (of Google), Bezos and so forth – I don’t think have that view. I think they see technology as a way to replace a lot of human thought and human activity and to make things easier and more convenient, not to challenge us to bigger things. The attitude of Silicon Valley, I’m speaking broadly not as a place but a state of mind, I think it’s changed and I think the change has evolved with the change in personal computing, which has gone from being a set of tools to being a kind of media environment that encloses us rather than opening up new horizons. And I think that’s unfortunate. Next up Test your knowledge Famous last words: Take our literature quiz!

Photo: Getty Images Originally Published By: A few weeks ago, a white Ford vehicle sporting an Uber logo and a lot of self-driving gear on the roof drove down my street in San Francisco. There was clearly a driver at the wheel and a passenger next to him, and it was hard to tell if it was in self-driving mode, since the driver’s hands were on the steering wheel. I was the only one staring at the car on the street in a possibly jaded San Francisco Bay Area, a hotbed of serious research and hype on autonomous cars and how they will change our lives. Many in Silicon Valley are convinced that robot cars are literally around the corner, as this one was for me. The recent barrage of news — from agreements between big auto makers and tech upstarts, to trials by nuTonomy in Singapore and Uber in Pittsburgh, to new set of federal recommendations and guidelines — seems to back up that view. But there is still a lot of work to do to make driverless car technology ready for prime time: get to affordable pricing, convince the leery about safety and most important, strong federal rules for the road. One of nuTonomy’s self-driving cars.Photo: AP A driver still sits behind the wheel of the nuTonomy car, but they don’t have to use their hands.Photo: AP The disconnect between a slow-moving reality and the Formula One pace in Silicon Valley minds is similar to the gradual approach from car makers and a hard push from tech companies, especially Alphabet. The resulting confusion from consumers was demonstrated at a recent panel on driverless cars, when speakers at the Commonwealth Club of California were asked whether people should wait before buying a new car, as they tried to get a sense of how close self-driving cars are to reality. We have to think about the fact that the laws are not going to move that quickly,” said Linsey Willis, a spokeswoman for the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, home of Concord, California’s GoMentum Station, the largest secure self-driving test center in the U.S. “If you are not able to take advantage of a shared network, my advice is to buy a new car.” That is music to the ears of anyone in the automotive industry. For all the partnerships and R&D efforts at auto makers around the world, they all are now in the classic innovator’s dilemma situation, where they can see a technology looming in the future that could disrupt their entire business. Ford readily admits that the industry is indeed at a serious inflection point and is one of the big auto makers forging partnerships, working with and buying startups. Read also: Ford is trying to disrupt itself in Silicon Valley Car makers, though, are taking a different approach to the self-driving car than tech companies like Google parent Alphabet, which is the farthest along in the autonomous-car race. Car makers are working within the existing automobile design and are adding more and more computing functions, while Alphabet‘s Self-Driving Car Project is starting from the ground up and redesigning the car, without brakes or a steering wheel, aimed at reaching full autonomy faster. Car makers’ evolutionary approach—with add-ons enabled by more sensors for semiautonomous driving features like adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection and parking assistance—is a way to ease consumers into the idea of more automated functions. This should increase consumer acceptance for the potentially scary but also convenient idea of a car that eventually drives itself, pushing through scares like a recent panic about Tesla Motors’ semi-autonomous features. Tesla has gotten a lot of publicity for its autopilot mode.Photo: Shutterstock Car-hailing companies offer more promise for early autonomous ambitions. Like Uber, Lyft hopes to lower its operating costs by eventually eliminating many of its human drivers and operating a service populated with many autonomous cars. “This is coming to our society,” said Emily Castor, director of transportation policy at Lyft, another panelist at the Commonwealth Club. “We’d rather be the Netflix than the Blockbuster in this situation.” Even the car-hailing vision, though, will likely play out gradually, first in limited-service vehicles like taxis with specific routes, such as to an airport, and partial truck routes on stretches of freeways — Uber recently acquired a self-driving truck company. That type of usage would allow the technology to learn and improve accuracy in vision and reactions. For consumers, a gradual approach is likely because the cars are initially going to be extremely expensive. Alex Lidow, co-founder and chief executive of Efficient Power Conversion Corp., a privately held chip company in San Jose, said he expected autonomous driving will gradually evolve like the once costly options such as anti-lock brakes and air bags, as the cost starts to come down. “I bet in 10 years, there are autonomous cars that you will be able to buy,” said Lidow, whose company makes chips for LIDAR systems that create three-dimensional images or maps of the surrounding area, a core component of self-driving vision systems. “They will be expensive, but you will be able to buy them.” Lidow, 61, believes it will be possible to buy a self-driving car before he has to give up his driver’s license due to old age. He estimates that autonomy functions will cost an additional $10,000 or more and first arrive for consumers in high-end models with luxurious amenities.

Check out the chips The wild card in the gradual approach is Alphabet, the closest to actually producing an autonomous car. Mike Ramsey, now an analyst with Gartner Inc., said it is easy to see that the Google parent company “is way ahead of everybody” based on data companies file with the Department of Motor Vehicles, so-called disengagement reports that tell how many times the vehicle operator had to intervene and take over the controls. In its most recent monthly report on its self-driving car project, Google said its cars have driven more than two million fully-autonomous miles on public roads. “It can get very confusing when you see all these announcements,” Ramsey admitted. “Uber is not ahead, they are not even close.…The lead in capability for Google is substantial, it is not insurmountable forever, but right now it is big.” And as Google and Apple get more competitive in every other business, Apple’s fans and its investors are wondering what exactly the company is doing in automobiles, after a slew of interesting reports in recent weeks. Apple has never confirmed that it is working on an electric and/or self-driving car, but there has been excitement since The Wall Street Journal first reported about a secret car project at Apple. Last year, Apple was tied to a leased vehicle loaded up with self-driving or mapping gear, and reportedly eyed McLaren Technology Group and San Francisco startup Lit Motors as automotive related acquisitions. So far, none of these deals has actually occurred, and Apple has never confirmed that it is working on any kind of a car, though Chief Executive Tim Cook has waxed enthusiastically about the car market. At the company’s shareholder meeting this year, he hinted that there are exciting things in development when he told a shareholder that investors would have to wait like a kid at Christmas, and that it would be “Christmas Eve for a while.” Tim CookPhoto: Getty Images Despite excitement from investors, Apple does not seem to be a real player yet. And Google desperately needs to find a partner to complete its vision, Ramsey said. See also: Why the father of the self-driving car left Google “They are now struggling to find someone to build a purpose built vehicle just for them,” Ramsey said. “They would love to sell that. They have the data from the car, they have you in the center of their ecosystem.” But car makers don’t want to be contract manufacturers for Google, especially because Google wants to own the whole system. Google has a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to test self-driving Pacifica minivans in a Detroit suburb, as part of a new research center it is establishing in the Motor City area but those vehicles were also recently spotted in a garage in Mountain View, Calif., according to the Verge. Every company has a big stake in this future, however it plays out. Apple needs a big product hit, Google wants to own all of your data, the car makers need to keep selling cars. Startups are trying to jump into a field with computing and robotics expertise, where their best hope is to be acquired for talent. And the government is trying to move faster, so it does not fall behind in making new rules for robots on the road. All of this competition and uncertainty means that we should probably hit the brakes on hopes for autonomous cars driving down our streets in mass numbers anytime soon, instead of the single oddball I spotted. When it does eventually happen, Alphabet and traditional auto makers will likely be the main players, but expect many bumps and collisions along the way.

Microsoft even criticized their behavior for putting millions of Windows users at risk. Google today published a new 0-day vulnerability in Windows which is still unpatched. Google reported it to Microsoft on Friday, October 21st, and as per their 7 day policy, they have disclosed it today. I think their policy for actively exploited critical vulnerabilities is not good for both the software makers and end users. Even after knowing that this vulnerability is particularly serious and it is being actively exploited, they want to publicize it. I don’t understand how a software company can fix a security bug in a software which has millions of lines of code and runs on hundreds of millions of machines of different configurations within 7 days. The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape. It can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a window handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD. Chrome’s sandbox blocks win32k.sys system calls using the Win32k lockdown mitigation on Windows 10, which prevents exploitation of this sandbox escape vulnerability. Hopefully, Microsoft will release a fix for this vulnerability via Windows Update soon. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google makes Chrome up to 15% faster on Windows 0 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Oct 31, 2016 at 19:44 GMT2 weeks ago Google is finally working on making Chrome faster and more reliable on Windows. The search giant today announced in a blog post that Chrome is now up to 15% faster on Windows. This is made possible by Microsoft’s Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) technology on Windows which compiles a special version of Chrome that tracks which feature on the browser are used the most. After analyzing this data, PGO optimizes the most used functions for speed, while the lesser used functions are optimized to have smaller (but slower) code. As a result, Chrome’s overall performance is much better, which also results in a smaller code footprint. Thanks to Microsoft’s PGO, Google Chrome’s startup time increased by 16.8%, new tab page load times increased by 14.8% and the page load time increased by 5.9%. This is quite a substantial increase for Google Chrome on Windows, and the update should make your browsing experience much better. Google, of course, is not the only company focusing on making your browsing experience smoother and more reliable. Microsoft has been focusing on performance and reliability for its Edge browser on Windows 10 for more than a year now, which is why Microsoft Edge is undoubtedly one of the fastest web browsers out there. Google has also been focusing on performance improvements for Chrome lately — for instance, the company significantly improved battery life in Chrome recently, and it also plans to introduce improvements for memory usage with a future update. Google stated that Chrome users running the 64-bit version of the browser can enjoy the PGO experience with Chrome 53 — however, if you are using the 32-bit version of Chrome, you can try out the PGO experience with Chrome 54.

Starting today, Google is rolling out “improved detection and filtering systems” aimed at fighting developers that try to boost their app’s install numbers, reviews, and ratings. “If an install is conducted with the intention to manipulate an app's placement on Google Play, our systems will detect and filter it,” Google explained. Google also notes that if it discovers that a developer continues to use fraudulent app installs and reviews to boost their app’s presence, that dev could have their app removed from the Play Store. Google already uses content discovery systems to weed out these fraudulent app installs and reviews, but today the company is stepping its efforts up. This is welcome news because when you’re searching for a new app, you want the system to show you apps that are quality and are well-reviewed, not apps that are appearing just because their developers used fake installs and reviews to boost their presence.

Could the biggest deal of the year also be the worst? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 31, 2016 at 3:50PM In the biggest deal of the year, AT&T (NYSE:T) recently agreed to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) for $85.4 billion in a half-stock, half-cash deal. The deal, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, values Time Warner at $107.50 per share -- a 35% premium to its stock price before the deal was announced. Image source: Time Warner. If the deal closes, it will combine one of the biggest media companies in the world with the nation's largest pay TV provider, second-largest wireless provider, and third-largest home internet provider. The combined company could generate almost $200 billion in revenues in 2017. But as many investors know, bigger isn't necessarily better in the world of big media conglomerates. The last big deal involving Time Warner, the infamous AOL-Time Warner merger in 2000, resulted in a whopping $99 billion writedown just two years later. While it looked like merging an internet giant with a media powerhouse made sense on paper, the two companies' cultures clashed, and promised synergies never materialized. Will AT&T's takeover of Time Warner go more smoothly, or is the telecom giant doomed to repeat history? Why AT&T wants Time Warner AT&T's top line growth has been weighed down by sluggish demand for wireline services and peaking demand for wireless ones. To spur growth again, AT&T divested some wireline assets, expanded its wireless services into adjacent markets like connected cars, and bought DirecTV to become the top pay TV provider in America. Those moves boosted its free cash flow, but they didn't address the longer-term challenge of younger tech companies -- like Netflix, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, and Facebook -- all expanding into its backyard. The rise of Netflix convinced many viewers to replace their pay TV subscriptions with cheaper broadband only plans. To meet that demand, Google introduced its Fiber wireline service, which led to the development of its Google Fi wireless service and Google Station Wi-Fi service. Google is also delivering internet access to remote areas with weather balloons, while Facebook is doing the same with a solar-powered drone. Facebook's Aquila. Image source: Facebook. As those tech giants enter the internet infrastructure market, traditional telcos are responding by acquiring media companies to make their pay TV packages more attractive. For example, bundling Time Warner's HBO Go and Now services with DirecTV, which is also bundled with unlimited wireless data plans, could cast a halo effect across all three businesses. AT&T could also offer "data free" streaming of Time Warner's content (HBO, CNN, Warner Bros., TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, and many live sporting events) across its network, as it previously did with its DirecTV content. Other companies currently have the option to pay AT&T for data free streaming. Why the Time Warner deal could backfire Like the AOL-Time Warner merger, the AT&T-Time Warner merger makes sense in theory. But in practice, merging two very different companies could cause the same conflicts which wrecked the marriage between AOL and Time Warner. AT&T hasn't had a great track record with vertical acquisitions. Back in 1991, it acquired business technology company NCR for $7.4 billion. But after failing to combine its expertise in communications with NCR's strength in computers, it spun off the company for just $3.4 billion in 1997. The merger will also likely face tough regulatory scrutiny, since the combination of such a huge telco and media company could be deemed anti-competitive by rivals in both industries. Regulators would also likely restrict AT&T from giving preferential treatment to Time Warner properties in its pay TV or streaming bundles, which would greatly diminish the merger's appeal. Moreover, Time Warner has already licensed out much of its content in long-term deals, which means that AT&T can't abruptly turn HBO or CNN into exclusive networks for its pay TV subscribers. Lastly, the financial burden would be huge. Moody's already downgraded AT&T's senior unsecured rating to Baa1 last year after its $18.2 billion purchase of AWS-3 spectrum licenses and its $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. On Oct. 24, the agency placed AT&T's ratings on review again, stating that buying Time Warner would boost its gross leverage to around 3.5x and possibly result in another downgrade. Should AT&T investors worry? As an AT&T investor, I'm not a fan of the Time Warner deal. It seems more like a desperate attempt to widen its moat against tech giants like Google instead of a well-thought out attempt to build an internet and media powerhouse. But I also don't believe that it will be as disastrous as the AOL-Time Warner deal, since the telco and streaming media industries are much more compatible than they were in the days of dial-up connections. I'll give AT&T the benefit of the doubt for now, but I'll still keep a close eye on this deal for any potential complications.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Google has a sweetener Are you still waiting for a Pixel phone? Google has a sweetener by Chris Smith 31 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments The new Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones are proving more popular than even the manufacturer expected and, as a result, getting ahold of one is proving quite tricky. Even some of those folks who were quick off the mark in ordering one of the ‘Made by Google’ handsets are still waiting for confirmed delivery dates. Now the firm is offering an apology to customers by way of a $50 credit for the Google Play store. The company is informing some Pixel purchasers via email. Related: Common Pixel problems and how to fix them The message says (via The Next Web): “Thank you for your recent purchase on Google Store. We’re really excited for you to experience our new products, but we have some not-so-great news: It’s going to take a little longer for you to receive your package than we expected. We know this can be frustrating, but the good news is that we’ve shipped your order and it’s on its way. “You should’ve already received a shipment confirmation email from us. We’re also going to send you a $50 Google Play credit via email soon after your package is delivered.” That credit can be used on movies, TV shows, music and apps once the phone arrives. Both Pixel phones have been met with largely positive early reviews. In our tests we awarded the larger Pixel XL phone a near-perfect score of 9/10. We praised the phone for its stunning, fast camera, bright display and impressive battery life. It also earned praise for the Google Assistant and Android Nougat version shipped with the device. It only lost points for the hefty un-Nexus-like price-tag, lack of water resistance and suspect durability. Video: Are the Google Pixel phones overpriced?

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Mimvi SEO Drives Revenue for New York Business Owners and Keeps Up with Google Penguin 4.0 NEW YORK, Oct. 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Mimvi SEO, once again, has displayed its rightful position on top of the SEO world. Over the past year, we have helped many business owners increase sales, revenue and see true ROI through our marketing strategies.  On September 23, 2016, Google announced Penguin 4.0, its latest update which disrupted its recent stability and threw many businesses for a loop. Photo – http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161031/434237 Businesses that were ranked in the top three on Google found themselves on the third page after the update was launched. There are thousands of factors, but no one outside of the powers that be at Google will ever really know why.  However, Mimvi SEO, an established Long Island based SEO and web design company, has developed strategies to keep its clients at the top. Mimvi SEO has always focused on long-term SEO.  Every SEO company faces the same challenge with its clients – trying to explain to him or her why two months after signing the contract, the increases in the rankings are not astronomical.  Many individuals without an expertise in SEO believe it could be as simple as pressing a button and boom, number one.  However, the benefits of slowly increasing ranks will keep a business at the top, while blasting a business to the top will likely lead to quickly blasting it back to the bottom.  Focusing on white hat SEO tactics is crucial, especially in the wake of Penguin 4.0. Marcus Becker, CEO of Mimvi SEO, says, “the backbone of SEO tactics has always been content and link building.  With the launch of Google’s newest update Penguin 4.0, it has become increasingly crucial to do link building for your inner web pages based on local SEO and avoid purchasing back links and link exchanges. All offsite SEO strategies should use unique, creative and expertly written content, as the more unique and the more professional a post is, the more positively Google looks at it. We are able to keep Mimvi SEO at the top of Google and other search engine ranks by frequently auditing our back links and removing negatively affected links.  We do the same for our clients, which keeps them coming back.” The SEO experts at Mimvi SEO also keep their clients on top by constantly monitoring their positions and adding variety to the SEO by avoiding keyword rich anchors, linking to the same target URLs but instead to other content pages and links to low quality Web 2.0’s and networks.  Needless to say, if you follow the strategies of Mr. Becker and his team, your ranks will surely dominate the competition, despite Google’s updates.

Google makes Chrome 15% faster on Windows Posted Oct 31, 2016 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Replicated raises $5 million for its product taking SAAS products out of the cloud Google is currently making a concerted effort to make its Chrome browser faster and leaner. The company announced a project to bring down memory usage earlier this month, for example. But it also quietly started work on some other optimizations recently, too, that add up to making Chrome on Windows run about 15 percent faster than before. Starting with the Chrome 53 release of 64-bit Chrome and version 54 of the 32-bit version, Google started using Microsoft’s so-called Profile Guided Optimization technology to speed up startup times (by 17 percent), new tab page load times (by almost 15 percent), and overall page load times (by 6 percent) in Chrome. Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) is a feature of Microsoft’s Visual Studio developer tools that measures how users actually interact with an application. It then uses this training data and re-compiles the application with a focus on optimizing the most often used functions of the application. “Chrome is a huge software project with more than a million functions in its source code,” Google’s Sébastien Marchand explains in today’s announcement. “Not all functions are equal – some are called frequently, while others are rarely used.  PGO uses data from runtime execution that track which functions are most common to guide optimization.” One of the most effective techniques PGO uses to speed up applications is to optimize where in the memory the often-used functions are kept so — at least in the ideal situation — those functions can be kept in the CPU’s fast instruction cache. You can read all about how PGO works in practice here, but the main takeaway is that Google is still able to squeeze more performance optimizations out of its existing code base for Chrome. Given that PGO isn’t exactly new, though, it does come as a bit of a surprise that the team didn’t use this technique already. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Not only is the new demo fun and interactive, but it is also widely accessible to those at home thanks to the use of open-source software and off-the-self components. The idea behind Cloud Spin was born out of a desire to create a photo booth that would be more engaging to use and more challenging to create. As a result, the Google team decided to build a photo booth that rotates images through 180 degrees. By capturing images from multiple angles, the photo booth produces a eye-catching three-dimensional effect. The images can then be knitted together to create animated GIFs of memorable moments. For those interested in building their own Cloud Spin photo both, the full list of instructions is available online from Google. 'BEST INNOVATION EVENT, EVER!'

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 31, 2016 2:10pm   Comments Share: Got a few minutes to spare? If so check out Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s Halloween-themed game, which is inspired by its Doodle. Google is known for its Doodles — a special and temporary change to the logo on Google's homepage to celebrate a holiday, event, achievement or individual. On Monday, Google's Doodle is actually a game. As noted by Fortune, a cat named Momo is on a special mission to rescue her school of magic. Users can help Momo by swiping the shape of a symbol that appears above a ghost's head such as a dash, arrow or lightning bolt. As the user progresses in the game, the level of difficulty increases. Google stated in a blog post that the game features five levels in a school environment, including a library, cafeteria, classroom, gym and the school's rooftop. "Doodling for a whole Doodle game was very exciting for us," the company said in its blog post. "We had so many ideas for elaborate symbols to draw, like a witch's hat that would appear on the character's head after it was drawn! In the end we decided that for a short game against the clock, simple was better. Plans like the "Eiffel Tower spell" were abandoned, and similarly, gag spells didn't make the cut. Regardless, we loved the process of dreaming up the possibilities." All embedded images were screenshots collected by Benzinga staffers.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- The Federal Communications Commission has sided with Louisville Metro government in the city's court fight against AT&T over an ordinance that seeks to make it easier for new broadband providers like Google Fiber to access utility poles. In a statement filed Monday in federal court, the FCC's top lawyer said Louisville's so-called "one touch, make ready" ordinance does not conflict with the federal agency's pole-attachment regulations. The FCC's statement undercuts one of the legal arguments advanced by AT&T, which is asking a federal judge to invalidate Louisville's ordinance because it conflicts with state and federal regulations. The Louisville Metro Council passed the ordinance in February in an attempt to pave the way for Google to bring its ultra-fast Internet and TV service to the city. The ordinance would allow new providers like Google to move and rearrange the wiring and equipment of other providers like AT&T on poles at the same time the new wires are attached. Supporters have said the law will reduce delays and disruption as new providers won't have to wait on their incumbent competitors to move their equipment, and the work can be done with one crew per pole instead of many. But AT&T said it worries about damage to its equipment -- in which it has invested millions of dollars -- and service disruptions if other companies are allowed to do the work in a way that doesn't conform to its standards. Joe Burgan, an AT&T spokesman, declined to comment on the FCC filing Monday. The closely watched case has implications beyond Louisville. In September, Nashville passed its own one-touch make-ready law, drawing lawsuits from AT&T and from Comcast. In its statement, the FCC said Louisville's ordinance does not run afoul of federal regulations because Kentucky is one of 22 states that have chosen to regulate utility poles at the state level. Even so, one-touch make-ready laws do not conflict with federal pole-attachment rules and are, in fact, encouraged by agency, the FCC said. "Historically, restrictions on access to utility poles have been a significant impediment to the deployment of competitive telecommunications services," the FCC said.   Google Fiber says it still plans to bring its service to Louisville despite putting other cities on hold as it re-evaluates its business model.  Google Fiber filed its own "friend of the court" brief earlier this month in support of the Louisville ordinance, and AT&T is fighting Google's intervention in the case. Meanwhile AT&T has been wiring the Jefferson and surrounding counties for its own AT&T Fiber service -- which offers similarly fast speeds -- and it is already available to some customers.

You can blame Google, the carriers or the hardware manufacturers, but you can never find a solution for all of the problems.  Until now. Google Pixel is the iPhone equivalent of the Android ecosystem: one phone to rule them all, made by Google and running the latest and greatest Android version. There are quite a few ways the Google Pixel will push Apple and the iPhone forward, and we are here to discuss all of them. Hardware copycats Hardware-wise there is nothing much to say, besides the fact that Google copied the iPhone in great details. We've got two phones with the same screen sizes as the iPhone, the same antenna lines on the back, and a TouchID button awkwardly moved to the back of the device. Even the chin of the Google Pixel looks like they were left with some space below the software buttons and there was no way to hide it or skip it. This is not something new. Samsung, HTC and other manufacturers have copied Apple products years in a row. The fact that Google did not invest in R&D and product design may prove to be an issue in the future. Both if Apple decides to sue them for stealing the design of the iPhone 6 and because the fruit-named company will move on to a new design and Google's will seem old and unfashionable. Google Photos versus iCloud Google is one step ahead of Apple when it comes to cloud storage. And the fact that it offers free unlimited storage for photos and videos (even high-resolution photos and 4K videos) gives it the upper hand in this battle. There is one catch, though: that unlimited space on Google Photos is only good for photos and videos, unlike iCloud Drive which can store documents, app data and other kinds of files. Also, only files created / taken on Google Pixel can be uploaded. Even so, Google Photos is an awesome addition to the Pixel. Shortage of cloud storage is a big problem these days and there is no way you can compare "Unlimited" with 32GB of the cheapest iPhone + the 5GB of storage given away for free by Apple with the basic iCloud account. I don't even want to remember the fact that the same iCloud account is split between an iPhone, an iPad and a Mac for most users and those 5GB prove to be far from enough for the basic back-up needs of a regular Apple user. Sure enough, Apple can improve in that field. Giving away 5GB for every device connected to an iCloud account is the first step. There were users who requested Apple to match the capacity of the device with the free tier of the cloud storage. For example, if you buy a 32GB iPhone, you also get 32GB of iCloud storage for free. Got a 128GB iPhone? Get the same space on iCloud. This is not something feasible for Apple, as MacBook Pros come in 2TB drives nowadays. Will this change the way Apple works? If the Pixel sales are good, Apple may consider changing the iCloud policies and offer more for the same price. Opening iOS to other devices or restricting Android to the Pixel How would you feel if Android were restricted to the Pixel or whatever the Google flagship phone is called? No competitors by Samsung, HTC, Huawei, or others. Fortunately, this will not happen anytime soon, because Google is not only in the business of selling the Operating System, but they want to be everywhere to gather data and display ads. Google will always have a larger user base for Android. Their problem would be to push the manufacturers, carriers and users to be on the last OS version. And that can prove impossible with cheap hardware coming from low-end manufacturers. Will this change the way Apple works? We know for sure that there will not be iOS on non-Apple hardware, but their apps may find a way to work on Android. And I am talking especially about iMessage and FaceTime. Apple Stores and the promise of "privacy" Google has two downsides when it comes to promoting its products. Apple has Stores and everyone can play with an iPhone before they buy it. Trying to decide between the Black and the Jet Black finish can be a challenge for some users, and doing that in the Apple Store makes a world of difference. Google relies on carriers' stores to promote the Pixel and we all know how motivated the employees can be when it comes to a phone. The pixel is only available in the United States and can be purchased only in Verizon Stores and Best Buy. Will Apple take advantage of that? Well, they already do that now. There is one other aspect of this story worth mentioning, the one related to the privacy, and I left this one at the end for a reason. Google has to convince users they will not collect information in order to use it for Ads and other nefarious purposes. Apple has taken the "privacy" route a couple of years ago and they are already running with it. Having a personal assistant (Siri) do all its computations on the device makes a big difference in the eyes of a user. Even the fact that Google Photos will scan all your pictures in order to provide fast and accurate search results, versus the way Apple does that on the device itself, can be a setback for the user. Will Apple benefit from that? Oh, you can bet they will! #Google Pixel#iPhone#Android#Google Photos#iCloud subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple's Real Courage Explain That, Apple!

Sorrell characterized the holding company’s relationship with Google as “good” and said, “Google search and YouTube video continue to be very powerful mediums, particularly in high-penetration TV markets.” He added that Google’s navigation of European regulatory and taxation issues has made it “more responsive” and collaborative in its relationship with advertisers. The WPP CEO had less kind words for Facebook, on which the holding company spent around a billion dollars on advertising last year. “Facebook, I think because it has been so successful, is probably, to be blunt, a little bit more difficult to deal with,” he said. “I think that’s not a view we are alone in having. Others would too if you ask around. My view is that is going to change because they will see the benefit and the merit.” Sorrell added that he’d like to see Facebook allow advertisers to have more access to its data in order to justify increased spending on the platform. The comments come in the wake of Sorrell’s harsh criticism of the platform after it was revealed Facebook “vastly overestimated” the average viewing time for its video ads. At the time, Sorrell claimed, “The referee and player cannot be the same person,” and his latest statements about allowing advertisers increased access to such data shouldn’t come as a surprise.  “Facebook puts great emphasis on outcomes and ROI [return on investment]. The data has to be independent data that justifies the position,” he added. “Facebook has a very close arrangement with Nielsen … something increasingly we are going to ensure that comScore [in which WPP has a near-20% stake] has that similar relationship with Facebook to provide alternate data because clients are investing now a lot of money.” < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Players vanquish ghosts by drawing symbols that appear over the phantoms' heads. "Doodling for a whole Doodle game was very exciting for us," the team behind the Halloween Doodle wrote in a blog post. "We had so many ideas for elaborate symbols to draw, like a witch's hat that would appear on the character's head after it was drawn! In the end we decided that for a short game against the clock, simple was better." The feline protagonist was inspired by Momo, a real-life black cat owned by one of Google's Doodlers. Originally, developers envisioned having a magic cat make a soup so good it raised the dead, but they opted instead for a cat at a magic school. "Connecting soup to Halloween proved too abstract, so the team shifted to the idea of a wizard school," the team said. "This opened the door to a more robust world filled with interesting characters and paw-some themes." Magic Cat Academy can be played on Google. © 2016 Cox Media Group.

The latest two hackathons were part of the Talking Peace Festival and took place in the UK and the Philippines. They brought together people from the worlds of technology and peacebuilding who worked across the night to develop ideas before pitching them to expert judging panels. Hacking hate speech in London #peacehackLDN ran at Google Campus and focused on tackling online hate speech in all its forms, from Islamophobia to cyberbullying. Recent reports reveal that social media and technology are being increasingly used to bully and stir up hatred, in the UK and beyond. The winning product was Hate speech blocker – a browser plugin that detects and prevents hate speech online, whether on social media or a discussion board. It flags a warning to users through a pop-up window. It is now available to use under the name of ‘Hate Free’ at the Google Chrome store. The Hate speech blocker team celebrate winning #peacehackLDN   Peter Barron from Google, Georgiy Kassabili from Facebook and Dr Sue Black, an award winning computer scientist, were all on the judging panel alongside Mana Farooghi, who runs our project that tackles Islamophobia in schools in northeast England. Pupils involved in this project also voted after sharing their own experiences and ideas throughout the hackathon. “The #peacehack competition is so inspirational!” commented Dr Black. “It clearly demonstrates that technology can be harnessed to make a positive difference in the world, improving the lives of those who are vulnerable to harassment, isolation and bullying.” Dr Sue Black, Peter Barron and Georgiy Kassabili announce the #peacehackLDN winners   First peace-themed hackathon in the Philippines #peacehackPh took place in Makati City and was the first hackathon with a peace focus to be organised in the country. It drew together over 50 developers and programmers, who in less than 48 hours developed a number of apps inspired by the theme of ‘Perceive, Engage, Alert, Communicate and Educate’ (P.E.A.C.E.). Judges take notes at the first round of #peacehackPh pitching   ​The winning idea was Hubert Bryan R. Ursua’s Peacetalk – an SMS-based helpdesk designed for people affected by conflicts or disasters and for groups with resources that can help these victims. “People won’t have access to the internet. The nice thing about this is people affected by conflicts or disasters will get information about what to do. People or groups with resources can act on victims’ needs”, said Ursua, the co-founder of a tech start-up. #peacehackPh winners with their prizes   ​Among the judges were Tim Smith from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Terence Ponce from Developers Connect (DevCon) Philippines, Michael Marin from WebGeek Philippines and Nikki de la Rosa from our Philippines team. #peacehackPh was organised in partnership with Smart Developer Network (Smart DevNet), and financial support was provided by DFAT.

Google appears ready to respond to potentially costly anti-trust allegations from European regulators. According to the New York Times, Google is expected to begin offering rebuttals later this week to charges from the European Commission that it hindered competition of its search and advertising services, as well as for Android, its mobile operating system. The report states that Google will begin submitting official responses to the Commission’s three cases against it as early as Thursday, however, European officials are not expected to make a final decision on any of the cases until mid-2017 at the earliest. If found in violation, Google faces fines of up to $7.5 billion and new rules on how it operates across the 28-member union, though it’s expected such a conclusion would trigger a lengthy appeals process. "We believe that our innovations and product improvements have increased choice for European consumers and promote competition," a Google spokesperson said in a statement to Billboard. "We look forward to making our case to the European Commission." The Commission has accused Google of the following: -- April 2015, the Commission accused the company of abusing its position as the dominant search engine by "systematically favoring its own comparison shopping product in its general search results page." The conduct infringes EU antitrust rules because it stifles competition and harms consumers, the Commission alleged. "It means consumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries," said top Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. -- April 2015, the Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation into conduct related to the Android operating system. A year later, in April 2016, the Commission formally filed charges claiming Google was breaking EU antitrust rules by requiring most smartphone makers to preinstall its OS and various applications, like Chrome and Google Maps. -- July  2016, regulators said Google was violating EU antitrust rules by imposing conditions on third parties that use its "AdSense for Search" platform for their search portals. According to the Commission, Google required third parties do the following: give Google exclusivity when sourcing search ads; make it so competing search ads cannot be placed above or next to Google search ads; give the most prominent space on results to Google ads; require Google to approve any changes to how competing ads appear. Following the July announcement, Vestager told CNBC that it was unclear whether the three cases -- shopping search results, Android, AdSense -- would ever be combined, "because what we see is a quite common pattern between them, quite different Google cases, that they seem to pursue a strategy of remaining dominant in search." Google controls about 90 percent of the online search market in Europe, experts have said. Other tech giants, such as Microsoft, have urged the EU to bring the case, pushing for more competition. Google has not confirmed the timing of its response to Europe, but earlier it rebuffed the allegation that its shopping results were killing competition. "Our search engine is designed to provide the most relevant results and most useful ads for any query," the company said in a blog post. "Users and advertisers benefit when we do this well. So does Google. It’s in our interest to provide high-quality results and ads that connect people to what they’re looking for. The more relevant the ads -- the better they perform in connecting potential buyers and sellers -- the more value they generate for everyone."

The New York Times’ DealBook reports: The cases relate to Android, Google’s mobile operating system, some of its dominant online search services and some of its advertising products. While each response will be couched in legalese, Google’s main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the region’s tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to Europe’s more than 500 million consumers. “Our search engine is designed to provide the most relevant results and most useful ads for any query,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, wrote in a blog post when previously rebutting some of Europe’s antitrust charges. “Users and advertisers benefit when we do this well. So does Google.” The company’s detractors—including small European start-ups, some local politicians and major American firms like Oracle—disagree with Google’s optimistic outlook. “Google has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that it’s still on the right track,” said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, which represents those of Google’s rivals that filed complaints against the company’s perceived dominance. “I don’t doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But that’s what other previously dominant companies thought, too,” he added. DealBook continues: Whatever happens, Google’s battle in Europe will not end overnight. European officials must first review the company’s rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest. If found to have breached the region’s rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process. Yet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.

Reply Anonymous • on Oct 31, 2016 6:39 pm All the Blacklist does is scam money from aspiring writers. This is not “very cool.” Reply s • on Oct 31, 2016 2:17 pm The Black List is a massive scam. They take money from unemployed writers, read their scripts, and do nothing. They make their list without the people who submit. It’s all a con!

That's generally what we have with her. www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd4NH9jKNas Clinton exposed her seizure when she tried to blame it on the drink. I could easily think she was just being silly, but she said something about the drink and not so many people talking at once. That's makes no sense to blame the drink. That wasn't voluntary and she was drifting off just before it began, having trouble keeping focus. Nobody knows the psychological effects of what is wrong with her. I don't want her elected. I know she'll get elected if I don't vote for Trump. Also, watch the machine and make sure it isn't flipping your vote. The cases I know of involve the flip right at the booth, Touching one vote and it registering as another, but it is visible if people look for it.

The object of Monday's game is simple: vanquish the enemy ghosts in Momo's school by using a mouse or touchscreen to draw the symbols that appear above their head. The game's five levels are all school-themed and include a library, a cafeteria, a classroom, a gym and a rooftop. At the end of each of the levels is a ghost boss armed with multiple symbols players have to draw. The symbols get more complex as the game proceeds. Since it’s a race against time, the game gets progressively harder with each level. Players start with five lives, but they can be replenished if a heart symbol appears on the side of the screen and it is drawn correctly. Related Stories Larry Page’s ‘Flying Car’ Project Ready For Takeoff? Google Maps For iOS Gets 4.24.0 Update The game was inspired by a Google “Doodler” named Juliana Chen. Chen’s pet black cat is named Momo. Last year’s Halloween Doodle was also a game called the Global Candy Cup, where four witches competed to collect the most candy. “It seemed like a good opportunity for a cat hero since the winner of last year’s Candy Cup Doodle was the yellow witch and her black cat,” Google explained in a post about the game. Google’s Doodle blog explained the game was the brainchild of the art, engineering, production and music teams combined. After discussing complicated symbols and signs like the Eiffel Tower, the Doodlers decided on a simpler game for maximum fun. Google’s Doodle team often creates interactive logos and games for various holidays and anniversaries. In August, 17 days of Doodle Fruit Games commemorated the start of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio. The website also debuted a Google Pac-Man game in 2010, an interactive crossword puzzle for the game’s 100th anniversary, and an interactive piñata for the company’s own birthday in 2013.

Especially if it seems too good to be true. Why? Look no further than Donald Trump’s Twitter account. Trump claimed Sunday morning that “Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.” Not only was there no proof of this, but it was pretty easy to disprove. The FBI email inquiry was at the top of Google News; FBI director James Comey’s name was at the top of Facebook’s “trending” box; and Twitter’s “moments” section had a prominent story about the controversy. Nevertheless, Trump’s wrong-headed “burying” claim was his most popular tweet of the day. About 25,000 accounts retweeted it and almost 50,000 “liked” it, helping the falsehood spread far and wide. The rise of social media has had many upsides, but one downside has been the spread of misinformation. Fake news has become a plague on the Web, especially on social networks like Facebook. As I said on Sunday’s “Reliable Sources” on CNN, unreliable sources about this election have become too numerous to count. So that’s what I recommended a “triple check before you share” rule. New web sites designed to trick and mislead people seem to pop up every single day. For their creators, the incentives are clear: more social shares mean more page views mean more ad dollars. But the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again. Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth. The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition. A recent BuzzFeed study of “hyperpartisan Facebook pages” found that these pages “are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information.” The less truthful the content, the more frequently it was shared — which does not bode well for the nation’s news literacy during a long, bitter election season. “Right-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages,” the BuzzFeed reporting team said. On a few occasions, made-up or highly misleading stories have even snuck into Facebook’s “trending” box — a problem that the company says it is trying to address. In a few cases, Trump aides and family members have themselves been duped by fake news stories, including a hoax version of ABC News with a story headlined “Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: ‘I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump’s Rally.'” A close look at the web site reveals that it is not, in fact, the actual ABC News. But the site tricked Trump’s son Eric Trump in early October. “Finally, the truth comes out,” he tweeted, promoting a link to the bogus story. As soon as I spoke about this on television on Sunday, CNN detractors filled my inbox with messages saying that CNN is the ultimate example of “fake news.” But that’s a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue. Whatever faults CNN has, news organizations small and large try very hard to report the truth. Fake news sites and Facebook feeds, on the other hand, traffic in misinformation. My sense is that there are three buckets of these sites: Hoax sites with totally made-up news headlines that try to trick you; Hyperpartisan sites that aren’t lying, per se, but are misleading, because they only share good news about your political party and bad news about the other party; “Hybrids” that purposely mix a little bit of fact and then a lot of fiction. These sites aren’t going away, so it’s up to Internet users to spot fake news and avoid spreading it. Fact-checking sites like Snopes can help — they are devoted to ferreting out hoaxes and tricks. Josh Stearns, a longtime media activist who now works at Democracy Fund, said newsrooms also have a role to play. “Fact checking has taken center stage in this election, but newsrooms need to go beyond fact checking politicians statements and help debunk viral misinformation too,” he told me. “At a time when trust in media is at an all time low, journalists should call out these fake news stories and help citizens tell fact from fiction.” Trump’s false claim about Google, Facebook and Twitter “burying” bad news about Clinton criticized what he called the “very dishonest media.” Ironically, he was using Twitter to blast Twitter. Trump may have gotten the idea from an inaccurate Zero Hedge blog post alleging a “social media blackout.” The blog post contained false information. I asked the Trump campaign to provide a source for the wild claim, but no one has responded.

Google today turned its homepage into a Halloween-themed animated game that follows young Momo the cat on a mission to rescue her school of magic from ghostly thieves. Players are tasked with helping the feline cast out spirits by drawing the shapes that appear above a ghost's head. Use your mouse on the desktop or finger on a touch-screen display to quickly draw straight lines, carets, hearts, and more, which will help Momo vanquish the invading ghosts and rescue her stolen spellbook. If they advance on Momo, she will lose one of her nine lives, so draw fast. As Google's doodle team explains, the inspiration for the doodle was artist Juliana Chen's real-life Momo. "The original concept for the game involved a magic cat making a soup that was so good, it raised the dead," Google says. "Connecting soup to Halloween proved too abstract, so the team shifted the idea to a wizard school. This opened the door to a more robust world filled with interesting characters and paw-some themes." The game follows Momo through five levels of the Magic Cat Academy: the library, cafeteria, classroom, gym, and building's rooftop. "Doodling for a whole Doodle game was very exciting for us," the Google artists say. //Related Articles 16 Streaming Horror Movies for a Truly Creepy Halloween Not every idea made it into the final race-against-the-clock game, though. "Plans like the 'Eiffel Tower spell' were abandoned, and similarly, gag spells didn't make the cut," Google says. "Regardless, we loved the process of dreaming up the possibilities." The game is available today in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Asia.

Despite the individual results of the quarter, the top tech stocks that dominate their specific arenas are most likely poised to continue that domination. In a technology world where size and scope often means the difference when confronting rivals and peers, it is clear that the big players will continue to hold and defend their turf. In a series of new research reports, Jefferies continues to stay the course on the top technology stocks that the firm has rightly championed for some time. While not all the technology picks blew out third-quarter numbers, they all have a sizable advantage in their niche areas, and investors can continue to add shares. These four technology giants are also rated Buy at Jefferies. Alphabet The search giant continues to expand and is even working on a driverless car now. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) provides online advertising services in the United States, the United Kingdom and rest of the world. It offers performance and brand advertising services, and it operates through Google and Other Bets segments. The Google segment includes principal internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, such as virtual reality. The Google segment also sells hardware products, comprising Chromecast, Chromebooks and Nexus. The Other Bets segment includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X and other initiatives. The company reported earnings last week against some very tough comparisons from this time last year. Alphabet announced fiscal first quarter results that produced 20% year-on-year growth in revenues to $22.45 billion, in line with most expectations. On a constant-currency basis, revenues grew 23%. Google segment revenues for the quarter were up 20% over the prior year. While Google’s operating profit grew by 16.7%, the operating margin declined by just under 1% basis point. The Jefferies analysts noted this in the report: Paid clicks grew 33% year-over-year, beating consensus of 26% and it was the best paid click growth number in years. Mobile search was the #1 revenue driver for the fifth straight quarter We continue to believe online video is the biggest online ad growth driver and YouTube is the premier vehicle to play that trend. The Jefferies price target for the stock is $1,000. The Wall Street consensus target is $ 965.29. Shares closed last Friday at $819.56. Amazon This company is the absolute leader in online retail and a dominant player in cloud storage business. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) serves consumers through retail websites that primarily include merchandise and content purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers. In addition, the company serves developers and enterprises through Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides compute, storage, database, analytics, applications and deployment services that enable virtually various businesses. AWS is the undisputed leader in the cloud now, and many top analysts team see the company expanding and moving up the enterprise information value chain and targeting a larger total addressable market. The company has had numerous recent product announcements, including Aurora for relational database engine, Quick Sight for business intelligence and AWS Database Migration Support Service. Amazon reported a mixed quarter last week, and Jefferies weighed in with this: Revenues were in line and margins were soft. Guidance was below expectations as the company continues to invest, but the sales midpoint was also below expectations. We’d buy the dip as nothing here changes our view that Amazon is best positioned to benefit from the shift of commerce from offline to online. The ability to deliver fast is differentiated and drives growth in new categories. Jefferies has a $950 price target. The consensus price objective is $920.02. Shares closed Friday at $775.88.

 Hillary Clinton's campaign got hacked by falling for the oldest trick in the book Ben Gilbert Oct. 31, 2016, 11:13 AM 78,790 facebook linkedin twitter email print Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a hacking problem. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images More specifically, her campaign's chairman, John Podesta, had his personal Gmail account compromised earlier this year. The hack, which US intelligence agencies have blamed on the Russian government, revealed more than 50,000 emails; the website WikiLeaks has since published thousands of those emails. Some of those emails have led to discomfort in the Democratic Party in the final month leading up to the November 8 election, revealing the inner workings of Clinton's presidential campaign across the past year, insecurities and all. How is it that a man such as Podesta, in such a position of importance, had his email compromised? It turns out he's just as susceptible to social-engineering hacks as your Uncle Morty. Podesta's email was apparently accessed by a simple social-engineering tactic called "phishing": Hackers emailed him posing as Google's Gmail account-services department. They then told him his password was compromised and provided a false link to a place to change his password (this appears to be where Podesta went wrong, eventually clicking this link and entering his information). Before doing anything else, Podesta's chief of staff forwarded that email to the Clinton campaign's internal computer-security department. A Clinton campaign help-desk staffer, seemingly fooled by the ruse himself, called the email "legitimate." He then asked Podesta's chief of staff to ensure that Podesta had two-factor authentication turned on (which adds extra security to his account) and to change his password. Even though the campaign staffers sent Podesta the correct email link from Google to reset his password, Podesta seemingly clicked the original link. Simply put: Rather than clicking a legitimate link from Google, he apparently clicked through to a fake website run by hackers. When he entered his account information, he handed over the keys to his Gmail. Friendly pizza deliveryman or social-engineering master? Probably just the pizza guy. Getty Images Phishing is a hacking tactic that is actually older than computer-based hacking, and it involves simple social engineering. Rather than trying to find holes in Podesta's personal internet security, using programs that guess password strings, for instance, hackers simply put on a disguise and tried tricking him. This is often done by posing as a figure of authority or as an expert; in this case, the hackers posed as Gmail security (an expert) and had their disguise backed up by Clinton's help-desk staffer. Even worse for Podesta, the human safeguards around him — his chief of staff, Sara Latham, and help-desk staffer Charles Delavan — mistook the disguise for something legitimate. If this is indeed how it all went down, Delavan made a huge mistake. There are two obvious red flags in the initial phishing email sent to Podesta: We blurred out John Podesta's email address here. Wikileaks First and foremost, you're never going to get an email from Google with "googlemail" as part of the URL. It seems legit, because if you go to www.GoogleMail.com, it redirects to Gmail. But Google doesn't call it "Gmail" for nothing. A quick search of your own Gmail account for the string "googlemail" most likely won't turn up any legitimate results from Google. That's because it's a fake address that's close enough to be believable. Google does indeed own the URL, adding all the more creditiblity, but you're unlikely to get an email from Google with "@googlemail.com" as the origin. But that alone isn't enough to deem this fake. The big giveaway here is the password-change URL: a Bitly link. Google will never send you a Bitly link as an official link. Bitly links are simplified versions of other links, like so: Here's a Bitly link to my favorite RoboCop GIF: http://bit.ly/2f0JHCC. The full URL for that incredible GIF is: http://giphy.com/gifs/thank-you-robocop-for-your-cooperation-U8bDgsXcnIEFy Get it? That means the Bitly link in the initial email sent to Podesta was actually hiding a URL — a fake site meant to look like Gmail's account retrieval that actually served as a front for the hackers. Podesta entered his login and password and then entered a new one. Voila: The hackers now have both his old and new passwords, as entered by John Podesta. (We obscured the Bitly link above in the email intentionally, as it still leads to a potentially malicious website.) But, to be clear, clicking through that Bitly link should have been another huge red flag for Podesta; the URL shows up with a ".tk" ending, the top-level domain name for Tokelau (a territory of New Zealand). And wouldn't you know it, Google — being one of the biggest internet companies in the world — has no problem locking down .com URLs.

Google Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | October 31, 2016 102 shares 76 20 0 6 0 0 0 0 0               Earlier this month, Google officially launched the Pixel and Pixel XL. While the company has launched, technically speaking, phones in the past, this year is certainly quite a bit different. Gone is the Nexus brand, and instead the Mountain View company has replaced it with the Pixel brand, pushing into a world where it designs its own phones, and those devices are more of a true combination of hardware and software. The Pixel and Pixel XL are, quite frankly, true competitors from Google. Up to this point the company has simply let other companies use its mobile operating system, Android, as they see fit, with the Nexus devices really standing out for the vanilla experience they offered. The software available on the Pixel is still vanilla Android, but Google has optimized it to work with the hardware, which should hopefully make for a smooth experience not only right out of the box, but for as long as the owner is using the phone.  There is a lot to like with the Pixel phones when looking at the specs. There's the AMOLED displays, one measuring in at 5 inches with an FHD resolution, and the other measuring in at 5.5 inches, and packing a QHD panel. They both have a 12.3-megapixel camera on the back, which, even after real world testing, stands out as one of the best, if not the best, cameras available in a smartphone. It offers a powerful processor under the hood, and so on and so forth. The Pixel phones were a long time coming, but now that they're here it was worth the wait. For those who have been able to get their hands on the phone, anyway. I've been wanting to write up this question for awhile now, ever since the phones launched, but with inventory being what it is, I ended up waiting a bit longer. The more people that have the phone by Google, the better the feedback can be, after all. I'm still waiting to get mine (hopefully next week), but there are a few things that I would change already. That includes the exclusive launch with Verizon. Don't get me wrong here, the commercials that I've seen from the Big Red carrier promoting the handsets have been pretty great, and even the ads from Google itself, which ultimately end up showing the Verizon logo at the end, are stellar. But I do wish more people had the opportunity to get the Pixel -- from their carrier of choice. Google obviously felt compelled to ink up a deal with Verizon at launch, but availability and options are always great for consumers. The other thing I'd change? That bottom bezel on the phone's front. It's as big as the iPhone's, but at least Apple's devices have that physical Home button (now a "button") to warrant the necessary space. The Pixel phones just have a big bezel below the display. It's not awful or anything, but, while I’m fine with the bezels on the sides, that one on the bottom is certainly prominent for no discernible reason.  But, what about you? Is there anything about the Pixel and/or Pixel XL that you'd change, after you've spent some time with the handsets? Or are the phones by Google just about as close to perfect as you'd like?

David Hammer created a company to do something he claims Google can't: give salespeople insights they need to do their jobs. Hammer, who spent six years as a product manager at Google, said his new company, Emissary, connects salespeople with former executives who have accumulated "invaluable knowledge throughout their careers." Hammer describes Emissary as a marketplace where salespeople connect with advisors who give them the inside scoop to win deals. It launched in beta in 2015 and publicly debuts today. Emissary includes thousands of business leaders, referred to as “Emissaries" from companies such as Nordstrom, Estee Lauder, Coca Cola, Samsung, Caterpillar, JPMorgan Chase, FedEx, Costco, The Home Depot, Uber and Omnicom Media Group. "Emissary lives where sales reps live — mostly their email," Hammer, founder and CEO of New York City-based Emissary, told CMSWire. "We offer a Salesforce sync that ensures 'Emissaries' are easily matched to a client's opportunities, but we view ourselves as a different part of the stack. We don't have any direct competitors. Before us, you either hired one-off consultants, who were hard to find and expensive, or used LinkedIn to network your way to these people the hard way."  Where Google Stops ... Hammer and the Emissary team claim this type of insight is unavailable anywhere online. In fact, Hammer said where Google and social searches and network and sales automation platforms end, Emissary can take over by directly connecting clients to Emissary. Ironically, the revelation about the vast amount of relevant data offline came at the company that made people billionaires with internet technology. "At Google I came to realize that we all have valuable, tacit knowledge that was not available online,” Hammer said. "With Emissary, we’re using technology to gain access to relationship-driven knowledge from trusted sources that can often make the difference between whether or not you close a deal.” David Hammer Salespeople can tap into a pool of more than 5,000 experienced business leaders on Emissary. They can get insights from them on the company to which they're targeting: what the company culture is, who the key decision-makers are and how the company makes buying decisions. "We think we're unique because we're serving clients down-funnel, after the deal has been qualified," said Hammer, a former intern at Microsoft. "Most sales acceleration tools are designed to generate more leads, not to close more deals."   Glory Google Days While at Google, Hammer worked alongside current Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. He led the team that developed the DoubleClick Bid Manager ad technology. He also created the initial product vision, built engineering and initial sales team and helped manage acquisition and integration of Invite Media. "Overall, my experience at Google was spectacular," Hammer told CMSWire. "I learned a ton of important things, including how to think at a truly global scale and the value of being stupidly ambitious. One thing my friend Hunter Walk said is that you get to see what world-class really looks like on a regular basis." Funding Boost Bob Hower, co-founder of Emissary investor G20 Ventures, said in a statement that human intelligence is the most important data for enterprise salespeople. Emissary, he said, is a "one-stop shop for intelligence that eliminates the blind spots we all face along the sales journey.” To spur early growth in his startup, Hammer and Emissary recently closed a $10 million Series A funding round led by Canaan Partners and G20 Ventures. This follows a previous $2 million seed round from The New York Times, Google Ventures and Nextview Ventures.  "Part of what inspired Emissary's creation was working at one of the most data-driven organizations in the world and realizing that we still didn't always make the right decision," Hammer said of his Google run. "Often times, we didn't have access to a piece of knowledge that sat in someone else's head, and we didn't know who that person was. I created Emissary because I believed if we faced that problem at Google, that organizations of all sizes must be facing that challenge." 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Domo Strikes New Low in Vendor Competition Everything You Thought You Knew About User Experience Is Wrong Kentico’s New Cloud CMS Is Headless, Thoughtful and Affordable 10 Social Media Tactics for B2B Marketers Design Through Customer Use Phil Fernandez Out at Marketo, Marc Andreessen Joins Dialpad Board, More News Microsoft Takes a Swipe at Salesforce with Dynamics 365 Release Ex-Google Exec Launches Emissary to Help Salespeople Reach Influencers Useful Article?

Yet it's become much less of one for me. Why? Because the ads that Google places on web pages are no longer interesting. What a relief! By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | October 31, 2016 -- 12:15 GMT (05:15 PDT) | Topic: Google Google is a large advertising business. They sell ads that use the information you give them when searching to let advertisers target you with offers that you will find appealing. It works - and that's the problem. A year ago I made DuckDuckGo (DDG) my default search engine. They bill themselves as the "search engine that doesn't track you" and asks if you are "ready to take back your privacy?" I like that. Special Feature Security and Privacy: New Challenges As big data, the IoT, and social media spread their wings, they bring new challenges to information security and user privacy. Read More Now, DDG isn't an exact replacement for Google, but they're close. I almost always find what I'm looking for with them, but it can be more work. The biggest feature I miss is that you can't specify a search period, such as the last week or year, or a date range. But only a few times in the last year have I been forced to go to Google for a difficult search. A year of living privately It took a couple of months before I noticed that my ad experience was changing, both online and in my spam folder. I use SpamSieve, an excellent spam filter for Apple Mail, to sort the 500 or so emails I get every day. Now, most of the online ads I see are either irrelevant to me or are related to my last search on Amazon. This is wonderful. I'm not sure how Google influences spam, but it has defintely changed. Now my spam folder is filled with spam that I don't care about. That makes it easy to go through hundreds of spam emails and not get hooked by an enticing subject line. What's more The types of untargeted ads are suggestive of the underlying demographic markers that advertisers - and Google - use to slice and dice their product- you. Gender. Possibly because of my name, I now get lots of spam and webpage ads targeted to women. I run ad blockers on some of my devices, but it sure makes web surfing easier when the ads are ones I will never care about. Ads for problems I don't have. Breast enlargement? Makeup secrets of the stars? Life insurance? Delete! Ads for interests I don't have. Woodworking? Russian beauties? Delete! The Storage Bits take My problem with targeted ads is that they work. I'm a little ADD so maintaining focus is often a challenge. For privacy and security, change these iOS... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 13 NEXT PREV Given the advantages of a Google-free existence, I have to wonder what Google is costing the world economy. If interesting ads cause each Internet user to spend an extra five minutes a day on non-productive shopping, with almost 3 billion Internet users today, that's 15 billion minutes or over 28,000 person years of productivity every day. It probably pales beside the time wasters on Facebook, which I am not on, but it raises a larger issue. When your demographics are packaged and sold, Google places you in a statistical box that advertisers bid on. The ads that target you remove your volition from the inputs in your life. You are a passive receiver, not an active searcher, defining and refining your own needs and desires. Free will may be a delusion, but it's a delusion I like. How does DuckDuckGo make money? Like Google they sell ads, but the ads at the top of their search results are directly related to the search that you made. They don't aggregate your data and sell it advertisers. If removing the friction of targeted ads appeals to you, try DuckDuckGo for sixmonths. I think you'll like it. Courteous comments welcome, of course.

Nov 2016, 00:56 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte öffnen in 8 Stunden 4 Minuten Hillary Clinton's campaign got hacked by falling for the oldest trick in the bookVon Ben Gilbert | Business Insider – Mo., 31. Okt 2016 16:13 MEZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a hacking problem. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) More specifically, her campaign's chairman, John Podesta, had his personal Gmail account compromised earlier this year. The hack, which US intelligence agencies have blamed on the Russian government, revealed more than 50,000 emails; the website WikiLeaks has since published thousands of those emails. Some of those emails have led to discomfort in the Democratic Party in the final month leading up to the November 8 election, revealing the inner workings of Clinton's presidential campaign across the past year, insecurities and all. How is it that a man such as Podesta, in such a position of importance, had his email compromised? It turns out he's just as susceptible to social-engineering hacks as your Uncle Morty. Podesta's email was apparently accessed by a simple social-engineering tactic called "phishing": Hackers emailed him posing as Google's Gmail account-services department. They then told him his password was compromised and provided a false link to a place to change his password (this appears to be where Podesta went wrong, eventually clicking this link and entering his information). Before doing anything else, Podesta's chief of staff forwarded that email to the Clinton campaign's internal computer-security department. A Clinton campaign help-desk staffer, seemingly fooled by the ruse himself, called the email "legitimate." He then asked Podesta's chief of staff to ensure that Podesta had two-factor authentication turned on (which adds extra security to his account) and to change his password. Even though the campaign staffers sent Podesta the correct email link from Google to reset his password, Podesta seemingly clicked the original link. Simply put: Rather than clicking a legitimate link from Google, he apparently clicked through to a fake website run by hackers. When he entered his account information, he handed over the keys to his Gmail. (Friendly pizza deliveryman or social-engineering master? Probably just the pizza guy.Getty Images) Phishing is a hacking tactic that is actually older than computer-based hacking, and it involves simple social engineering. Rather than trying to find holes in Podesta's personal internet security, using programs that guess password strings, for instance, hackers simply put on a disguise and tried tricking him. This is often done by posing as a figure of authority or as an expert; in this case, the hackers posed as Gmail security (an expert) and had their disguise backed up by Clinton's help-desk staffer. Even worse for Podesta, the human safeguards around him — his chief of staff, Sara Latham, and help-desk staffer Charles Delavan — mistook the disguise for something legitimate. If this is indeed how it all went down, Delavan made a huge mistake. There are two obvious red flags in the initial phishing email sent to Podesta: (We blurred out John Podesta's email address here.Wikileaks) First and foremost, you're never going to get an email from Google with "googlemail" as part of the URL. It seems legit, because if you go to www.GoogleMail.com, it redirects to Gmail. But Google doesn't call it "Gmail" for nothing. A quick search of your own Gmail account for the string "googlemail" most likely won't turn up any legitimate results from Google. That's because it's a fake address that's close enough to be believable. Google does indeed own the URL, adding all the more creditiblity, but you're unlikely to get an email from Google with "@googlemail.com" as the origin. But that alone isn't enough to deem this fake. The big giveaway here is the password-change URL: a Bitly link. Google will never send you a Bitly link as an official link. Bitly links are simplified versions of other links, like so: Here's a Bitly link to my favorite RoboCop GIF: http://bit.ly/2f0JHCC. The full URL for that incredible GIF is: https://giphy.com/gifs/thank-you-robocop-for-your-cooperation-U8bDgsXcnIEFy Get it? That means the Bitly link in the initial email sent to Podesta was actually hiding a URL — a fake site meant to look like Gmail's account retrieval that actually served as a front for the hackers. Podesta entered his login and password and then entered a new one. Voila: The hackers now have both his old and new passwords, as entered by John Podesta. (We obscured the Bitly link above in the email intentionally, as it still leads to a potentially malicious website.) But, to be clear, clicking through that Bitly link should have been another huge red flag for Podesta; the URL shows up with a ".tk" ending, the top-level domain name for Tokelau (a territory of New Zealand). And wouldn't you know it, Google — being one of the biggest internet companies in the world — has no problem locking down .com URLs.

However, it seems like a handful of those users are experiencing some odd battery issues on their devices… According to multiple users on a Reddit thread from over the weekend, the 6P isn’t doing well with Android Nougat. One user uploaded a video (which you can see below) that shows the phone turning off completely and refusing to turn back on until the charger is plugged in … just after taking a few photos. This is behavior similar to if the battery had run out of power, but as we can see in the video the user still had plenty of power left. Other users are reporting the same issue, in some cases with the phone rapidly depleting its charge after going below 25%. Before switching to the Pixel, I had also noticed a significant drop in battery life compared to when I was on previous versions of Android. We don’t know yet how many Nexus 6P owners are seeing this issue, although quite a few are reporting it online. It’s also unknown what the exact cause is, but it seems like Android Nougat may be the culprit and not a hardware specific problem. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

We tell you why For more than an hour or two this morning, Google showed the photo of Hillary Clinton when people searched for 'pathological lying'. We tell you how it happened. IndiaToday.in  | Posted by Vivek Surendran  desk-itgd@intoday.com New Delhi, October 31, 2016 | UPDATED 14:36 IST A +A - Google shows Hillary Clinton's photo on searching pathological lying. Photo: Screenshot from Google Highlights 1 Google showed Hillary Clinton's photo on searching pathological lying. 2 Google search suggested a Wikipedia page which had Hillary's photo. 3 Wikipedia search history shows the article was edited more than 30 times today. The campaigns for upcoming US Presidential Elections have been ugly to say the least. Aggressive personal attacks were a constant part of the campaigns by Republican party nominee Donald Trump and Democratic party nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump referred to Clinton as "crooked Hillary", the world called him a serial liar.  However, for more than an hour or two this morning, Google search showed Hillary Clinton's photo when people searched for 'pathological lying'. Photo: Google screenshot   Trump has accused Clinton of lying, but was that the reason for Google throwing Hillary's photo, suggesting she could be a liar?  NO. As you can see, what Google search suggested as the first option for 'pathological lying' is a Wikipedia article. We checked the Wikipedia edit history and saw that this particular article has been edited more than 30 times today. Photo: Screenshot from Wikipedia Photo: Screenshot from Wikipedia  Wikipedia moderators have now restored the original content of the page. Some of the edits made were removing the introductory paragraph of the article and replacing it with 'Hillary Clinton' and adding Clinton's photo to the article. A Washington Times report says that an unnamed editor stated 'pathological lying = Hillary Clinton' in the Wikipedia article and that the comment was later deleted. A report in the Huffington Post says that the above article has been locked to further edits till November 3 and that Wiki moderators cited that the page was "vandalised". Otherwise, the Wikipedia article on 'pathological lying' has no reference to Hillary Clinton whatsoever.   For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in. ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.     # Hillary Clinton# Google   Recommended Watch Right Now Top Takes NEWS INDIA WORLD PHOTOS CRICKET MOVIES AUTO SPORTS LIFESTYLE TECH EDUCATION BUSINESS SITEMAP Copyright © 2016 Living Media India Limited.

Players are tasked with helping the feline cast out spirits by drawing the shapes that appear above a ghost's head. Use your mouse on the desktop or finger on a touch-screen display to quickly draw straight lines, carets, hearts, and more, which will help Momo vanquish the invading ghosts and rescue her stolen spellbook. If they advance on Momo, she will lose one of her nine lives, so draw fast. As Google's doodle team explains, the inspiration for the doodle was artist Juliana Chen's real-life Momo. "The original concept for the game involved a magic cat making a soup that was so good, it raised the dead," Google says. "Connecting soup to Halloween proved too abstract, so the team shifted the idea to a wizard school. This opened the door to a more robust world filled with interesting characters and paw-some themes." The game follows Momo through five levels of the Magic Cat Academy: the library, cafeteria, classroom, gym, and building's rooftop. "Doodling for a whole Doodle game was very exciting for us," the Google artists say. Not every idea made it into the final race-against-the-clock game, though. "Plans like the 'Eiffel Tower spell' were abandoned, and similarly, gag spells didn't make the cut," Google says. "Regardless, we loved the process of dreaming up the possibilities." The game is available today in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Asia.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intrusive interstitials: What’s all the fuss about? By Paul Thompson Shares This August, Google announced that it will take down and possibly penalise “intrusive interstitials” on mobile web pages from January 2017, in a move that is indicative of the growing momentum for higher quality advertising. As the search engine acknowledges in its blog, “pages that show intrusive interstitials provide a poorer experience to users than other pages where content is more immediately accessible.” To address this, the changes will see Google potentially downgrade the mobile search ranking of sites which use excessive interstitial pop ups, providing a major incentive for advertisers to develop more effective and consumer-focused content. User experience rules all This initiative marks another key step in the battle against poor quality advertising, and Google should be applauded for recognising that consumers deserve to be protected from unscrupulous advertisers that want to grab attention at all costs. According to research from Harvard Business School, capturing attention is gradually proving trickier, and with the emergence of omnichannel, consumers have become inundated with intrusive and irrelevant adverts across multiple channels, driving them to disengage. However, even as consumers’ attention becomes harder to attract, the industry needs to acknowledge that it's been abusing the patience of consumers, and work towards better creative, underpinned with better and more precise targeting. The user experience is therefore now becoming a key priority for a growing number of channels and industry players, as we’ve seen with Facebook’s decision to disable ad blockers and commit to improving the quality of advertising. This in turn is driving demand for new, more user-friendly advertising formats such as native, which is mutually beneficial for advertisers, publishers and consumers alike; native formats are proven to dramatically increase consumer engagement, and have the added advantage of being bypassed by ad blockers. As an estimated 80 per cent of mobile users are currently using ad blockers or desiring to do so in the future, this immunity is vital to enable brands to reach their intended audience without interruption. Turning native With IHS predicting that by 2020 in-app native advertising revenue will generate almost two-thirds (63.2 per cent) of mobile display advertising revenue, amounting to $53.4 billion in total, it’s clear that the advertising landscape is changing, and shifting away from the interruptive or annoying adverts that have caused the surge in ad blocker downloads, and prompted Google’s decision. So what exactly is native advertising? Native adverts are designed to fit seamlessly with editorial content, mirroring its look and feel. As a result, the format is much more consumer-friendly than intrusive interstitials, enhancing, rather than disrupting, the customer experience. This approach is proven to drive consumer engagement and encourage sharing, with a recent IPG Media Labs study revealing that 32 per cent of consumers are likely to share a native ad, versus only 19 per cent who would want to share a display ad. In addition, as the content fits organically with its host platform, it is much harder for users to subconsciously block out, as can often happen with other advertising formats.  Native adverts also have the added advantage of being able to benefit from the status of the publication they’re hosted by, helping a brand establish an affinity with users, even if they weren’t previously aware of it. The results speak for themselves; according to Forbes, native advertising can increase brand lift by as much as 82 per cent. Location, location, location For brands looking to maximise the success of native campaigns, integrating location data is vital. Location data can provide a wealth of high-quality and precise consumer behavioural and contextual insights,enabling marketers to build a high definition view of the consumer. Through this approach, advertisers can ensure that they target the right consumers at the right time and place, with the right content, helping to dramatically increase engagement and drive ROI.  By addition location to native ads, marketers are able to further enrich the advertising experience, through incorporating users’ physical context into audience targeting. The ads then in turn complement both the in-app experience and the users’ physical location, making them more likely to engage. Where do we go from here? With the native ad industry set to quadruple in size between 2013 and 2018, coupled with the surge in ad blocker downloads, the time is ripe for the rest of the industry to acknowledge that it's been abusing the patience of consumers. It should therefore look to follow Google’s example, by making the customer experience a personal one. At present, all companies must ensure they are preparing for the new changes and explore different options if their websites currently make use of interstitials that could affect future rankings. In the immediate future, they’ll need to address the real issue – how they can produce quality advertising and how they can educate consumers about the benefits of advertising. While poor quality, untargeted advertising undoubtedly has many flaws, advertising has been instrumental at keeping the internet free at the point of use. We should therefore look to work towards a scenario where consumers are educated about the huge benefits advertising could bring, and where consumers accept a free service in exchange for agreeing to view personalised, targeted advertisements, delivered at an appropriate time and place. At the same time, the advertising industry has a responsibility to ensure that we’re always putting consumers’ interest must at the forefront of each campaign, by serving the right content to the right people, at the right time, in the right location, and in a user-friendly format. Through this approach, consumers will only receive content which is interesting and relevant, which they will want to engage with. This in turn drives ROI for marketers and revenues for publishers, while enhancing the overall user experience. Once this happens, we can finally achieve publisher/consumer unity. The real question is; will you be a part of it?

Newsletter Signup WebProNews Navigation Categories Advertising Business Developer eCommerce Search Social Media Tech All Search Categories Advertising Business Developer eCommerce Search Social Media Tech All Search Google Adsense Team on How to Stay Compliant WebProNews10.31.2016Advertising Share this Post The Google Adsense team posted this morning what they consider to be the 8 most important best practices for not violating Adsense policies and to keep your account in good standing. Most of them are rather obvious, like "don't click your own ads" but they are worth reviewing if you make money from Adsense. 1. Don’t click on your own ads There is no way to get your website banned quicker from Adsense than clicking your own ads. Simply don't click them and don't ask others to click them. "These kinds of clicks won’t count toward revenue and may get you suspended," notes Anastasia Almiasheva of the Adsense team. "Even if you’re interested in an ad or looking for its destination URL, clicking on your own ads is prohibited. Instead, use the Google Publisher Toolbar." 2. Think like a user Write or create content for your users, not just to target certain types of Adsense ads. This is basic SEO as well of course, so they are simply saying good valuable and unique content that users enjoy consuming converts better than simply using copied content or stuffed keywords. 3. Keep it family-friendly and legal Google promises their advertisers that their ads will not appear on adult sites or illegal sites, so it's best to stay family friendly. There are plenty of adult ad networks if you produce that kind of content. 4. Maximize content, not ads per page Keep ads, Adsense and otherwise, to a minimum. Your web pages should be about the content, not the ads. This is especially true above the fold, where Google actually has an algorithm that defines the percentage of ads and if it's too high will penalize from an SEO perspective and will notify Adsense partners as well. 5. Avoid deceptive layouts Google only wants their ads to be clicked when there is an intention by the user to click the ads. "Keep ads away from games, slideshows, and other click-heavy content and don’t place them near images," says Almiasheva. "Publishers may not use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks. This includes, but is not limited to: placing images next to individual ads, placing ads in a floating box script, formatting ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on the page, formatting content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads and placing misleading labels above Google ad units." 6. Create unique content As we said earlier, content is king with Google in general and especially when their ads are on your website. Don't simply rewrite content and always attribute quotes properly. Make your content stand out by being uniquely produced by you or your team. Building a long-term relationship with your audience is what's important, and you can't do that by copycatting others. 7. Track your traffic It's up to you, the webmaster, to know that your traffic is real and is not bot produced or otherwise artificial. Also, you should make sure that your traffic is coming organically and not from spammy links or links from what Google considers bad neighborhoods. 8. Follow the Code of Implementation Guide Never modify Google's Adsense code and always follow the Code Implementation Guide.

They represent all the phrases which you type into Google search box when surfing the net. Having this in mind, you can quickly establish that SEO is a user-oriented profession. In fact, expert’s proficiency can be measured by their ability to discover trending keywords and rank for them. In other words, SEOs ability to perform keyword research. Similarly to any commercial products, there are two main things that should concern us – the strength of our competition and the demand for a certain keyword. By using SEO terminology, we can say that two main factors of keyword research are: Search Volume (number of monthly searches) Keyword Difficulty (competitiveness of a keyword) Unfortunately, unlike a classic economy where everything is quantifiable, things get a bit troublesome in the world of SEO. We usually rely on stats provided by the Google Keyword Planner tool which is based on PPC (pay per click) or paid search. It is really hard to establish the real state of things and it usually comes down to approximation. But, we will discuss that later on in the article so stay tuned. For now, let’s start with the basics. What type of keywords should I pursue? There are two types of keywords that you should consider during your keyword research: Those that can bring you profit (so called “money” or commercial keywords) Those that can bring you traffic and links (also known as informative keywords) Most websites exist so they could make a profit. In the majority of the cases, the products are directly sold through the website and shipped all over the country/world. This is why it is necessary to rank for keywords that will lure potential customers to your website and increase your sales. Whenever you create some content, you have to consider your potential clients. What kind of a keyword will they use when searching for a product? These phrases will usually include descriptive words such as buy, cheap, affordable, etc.. They will help your customer pinpoint just the thing they need. Unfortunately, as keywords become more commercially oriented, they will also become more competitive. For example, phrases with “buy” and “cheap” in them are among hardest ones to rank on the Internet. Nevertheless, you still have to try and rank for them as they are the best way for you to remain profitable. On the other hand, you can search for keywords that will attract additional traffic. Why would I do that, you might ask? Simply put, unless you have enormous amount of money to spend on an aggressive marketing pay-per-click campaign (such as the one performed by Amazon), you will have to build your website from the ground up which will ultimately bring a lot of organic traffic. You will require more links and shares to get to that point and the best way to get them it by writing about things that will interest larger audience. Here, I am not only referring to potential clients but also news websites, popular blogs within your niche and industry experts. Let’s use this example. You are selling tractors. One of the first articles which you posted on your blog is about different types of tractors. Naturally, you are trying to promote your own tractors by linking to your product pages. If the piece is awesome, you might get several links and a nice bunch of shares. As an alternative, you can create an awesome article about new agricultural measures. It may elaborate something that everybody is talking about and ultimately, it will give your website a lot of buzz. The drawback of this second method is that your website won’t be making any profit. Yes, there will be a lot of visitors on your website but this will not be commercial audience. When it comes to selling your tractors, the conversion rate will be minimal. However, this is a good initial step towards building your brand and online presence. For short-term goals, money keywords should be prioritized. For long-term, you need both types. Bear in mind, no matter what you do, you will have to use commercial keywords as a way to keep your website afloat. Structure of a keyword The structure and length of a keyword is one of the crucial things that are directly correlated to its difficulty and volume. As I previously mentioned, there are certain types of keywords that are significantly more difficult to rank for. On the other hand, there are those that constantly have high or low volume or may even fluctuate. A Good example is “Summer Olympics”. Length of a keyword is another factor that is important for volume and difficulty. As you can presume, volume becomes lower for longer keywords and vice versa. Based on their length, we can differentiate three types of keywords: Short-tail keywords (1 to 2 words) Medium-tail keywords (3 to 4 words) Long-tail keywords (longer than 4) When it comes to structure, we can differentiate: Head (main word or a phrase which is the centerpiece of the search) Modifier (a word which can be substituted for other words in order to change a single aspect of the keywords meaning) Tail (all other words used to describe or explain our query) Short-tail keywords are the simplest formation. They only have a head word. Generally speaking, it is nearly impossible to rank for such a phrase due to extensive competition. However, they do bring an enormous traffic. Medium-tail keywords are just the thing we are looking for. As you can presume, 3 to 4 word phrases are extremely sought after. They definitely do not have the same volume as short-tail keywords but with them, you stand a chance of ranking. Long-tail keywords are longer phrases than four words. Even though they are really easy to rank for, they are often neglected due to their low volume. However, long tails can also be quite powerful when you rank for a lot of them at the same time. Basically, when you perform research, you should focus on phrases that have medium volume and low or medium difficulty (thus medium-tail keywords). But, there is a catch. Keyword research doesn’t stop when you find such a phrase. Instead, you need to focus on those medium-tail keywords that are performing better than the rest. If a keyword has lower volume, it needs to compensate by being easier to rank for. On the flipside, if it has medium difficulty, it needs to have higher search volume to justify the effort. Finding keyword ideas In order to do keyword research properly, we need a lot of initial ideas that will lead us during the process. Based on the previous chapters, you somewhat understand what is required from you. Now, let’s find a way to detect all those phrases that can have a positive impact on our sales. It is usually recommended that you start from your main product or service which you are offering. Commercial keyword research is much more limited. You already know what you have to focus on and you will do everything to optimize around that phrase. On the other hand, if you wish to boost website’s stats, you are able to create different content. Always have in mind that besides your own industry, you can also tap into niche markets. They include all the topics that are somewhat related to you but are not exactly what you are offering. We can call them shoulder niches. How to find keywords Let’s review all the tools and approaches you can us to get keyword ideas: 1) Google auto-suggest and searches related to Google itself is a keyword suggestion tool. For example, when you start typing in a phrase the search engine will start completing your sentences, giving you 10 suggestions as you go. At the same time, on the bottom of every page there will be “Searches related to” section. Here, Google will give you eight additional suggestions that are closely related to your topic. However, due to its limitations, the biggest search engine can only be used as a way to get basic understanding of the topic. Nevertheless, it is a solid starting point. 2) Wikipedia  Oftentimes when we look for something on the internet, we turn to Wikipedia as a source of extensive knowledge. Even though there are better sources for particular topics, this website is still considered as the best and most comprehensive encyclopedia. By entering your main keyword in its search engine, you will get a page with a description. Here, in the table of content, you can get other relevant topics and sub-categories. Most of these sub-categories are really extensive and they can be used as source to additional research. We refer to them as shoulder niches or niches that are in some way related to our own niche. 3) Quora, Yahoo! Answers and forums For some time now, Quora and Yahoo! Answers have been the two best places for finding answers to all your questions. Nevertheless, every industry has its own forums that are recognized as good source of information. Now, here is the general idea. If someone has already looked for something on forums, there is a high chance they will use the same (or similar) phrase in Google search bar. By using these platforms, you can easily learn what are the trending topics, what are people interested in and subsequently, what is going to bring most traffic to your website. BoardReader.com is a forum search engine that can be extremely useful when it comes to collecting keyword ideas from forums and online boards. Simply enter your keyword in its search box and you’ll be given lots of keyword ideas directly from forums which you won’t be able to find anywhere else. 4) Google Trends and Google Correlate  As I mentioned, search volume for keywords is not static. It fluctuates. If you are an SEO expert, you should recognize rising and falling trends and act accordingly. This is why many experts like to use Google Trends as the initial point of their research. If the number of searches per keyword is rising, this means that we have a chance of creating awesome content before the topic becomes too popular and hard to rank for. Furthermore, Google Trends can show you from where the majority of the traffic is coming from and give you some additional keyword ideas. Google Correlate is part of Google Trends. It uses as a scale of 1 to -1 to show you the level of correlation between your starting keyword and all the other phrases. To rephrase, it shows the search patterns where some keywords are likely to rise or fall together with your main keyword. 5) Google Keyword Planner Google Keyword Planner is one of the most commonly mentioned tools when it comes to keyword suggestions and there is a good reason for it. This tool is based on AdWords system where search engine is able to calculate volume, competitiveness and price for each keyword. Unfortunately, when it comes to volume and competition, it is based on paid search not the organic one. As of late, Google focused on using it primarily for PPC. So, unless you invest some money in paid campaign, you cannot get good results. Nevertheless, it is still a good tool for getting keyword ideas. First, you need to access “Search for new keyword and ad group ideas” option. Then, you are interested in two things: Ad group ideas (suggested keywords are categorized into potential ad groups) Keyword ideas (a list with keywords that are closely related to your main keyword) Although you can only use keyword ideas, I strongly recommend that you also use Ad group ideas. It will widen the scope of your search a lot. For example, if you use “cat food” keyword, you will instantly get several suggested phrases consisting of both “cat” and “food”. They will have volume, suggested bid, competition and other stats. However, if you use Ad group ideas before Keyword ideas, you can get a list with all the other related groups of keywords such as “cat toys” and “pet food”. As you see with Ad group ideas you not only get suggestions based on your main keyword but also semantically related words and phrases that your competition might not even know they exist. 6) Keyword Shitter This rather simplistic keyword suggestions tool is considered as one of the most comprehensive tools of its kind on the internet. Besides the fact that it is easy to use, it provides amazing results. All you have to do is type in a keyword and this program will give you a huge list of suggestions. To refine search, you can use positive and negative filters that will include or exclude certain word or phrase. This tool needs some time to retrieve all the results but it is more than worth it. Word of caution – after a while it will start giving unrelated results. Because of it, you will have to be careful when assessing them. After your list is complete just head back to Google Keyword Planner, copy-paste the list of results Keyword Shitter got you add the most lucrative keywords to your list.

You can use Google, Bing, YouTube, Amazon and other search engines and add suggestions to your list. For example, you can add several suggestions from Google and then start browsing Bing and add several suggestions from Bing. What makes this tool so special is the fact that it doesn’t only give you words to add before and after your main keyword, but it does this for every letter in the alphabet. For example, if your main word is “organic food”, Keyword.io will give you ideas like “best organic food” or “organic food delivery” for every letter from A to Z. At the end of the process, you can export all these results to use later on in Google Keyword Planner of some other tool of your choice. 8) SEMRush When it comes to reverse engineering your competitors’ SEO, SEMRush is definitely the tool which you always have to have in your arsenal. Its unique advantage lies is its ability to show very accurate organic and PPC data for almost every website. This great program can be used to spy on your competition and check out their keywords (among other things). Just enter the URL of your main competitors in SEMRush and see exactly where their organic traffic is coming from. It will give you pretty accurate data allowing you to copy the strategy of your competition. SEMRush shows all the ranking keywords of a website and their current positions in Google together with the percentage of traffic they bring and many other useful stats. It is a great way to get some fresh keyword ideas that no other tool can show you. Assessing the keywords and your competition You probably have an extensive list of results in front of you by now. That’s great! Now, you need to examine all of them and find just the right keyword that has greatest potential. If I wrote this article a couple of months ago, I would definitely suggest using Google Keyword Planner. Due to the significant changes that Keyword Planner undertook, it is no longer an option that’s free for everyone. Google wanted to place emphasis on PPC users that spend money on AdWords . As an organic user, you won’t get the full scope of things. But, there are other tools which can be used. During this part of research, you have to determine search volume and keyword difficulty of a keyword. You also need to see how much work it will take to reach top rankings in Google which can be done by analyzing the links of your competitors as well as the strength of their websites. How to use your keyword research tools Some things can be done quickly and painlessly without having to invest a cent. But, during this stage, it is recommended to invest some money in tools. Have in mind that you are able to perform the entire research without spending any money. But, for optimal results, you might consider getting some of the keyword research tools from the list. Now, let’s see what kind of programs you need. 1) io – assessing keyword volume  Maybe Google Keyword Planner changed but Keywordtool.io hasn’t. The tool is based on the same data which can be found in Google Keyword Planner. In fact, it extracts all the info from it. So, even though Keyword Planner is no longer an option, you have a suitable replacement. It provides three basic types of data: Volume (total number of monthly searches in Google) CPC (cost-per-click or the amount of money that bidders pay for that particular keyword) AdWords Competition (number of people bidding for that keyword) Although this data is based on PPC, it does show us how competitive and popular a keyword is. Be cautious though because this is only an approximation. It doesn’t show the real state of organic traffic. Similarly to Keyword Shitter, you have a positive and negative filter which allows you to include or exclude certain words to your liking. On top of that, you can further filter your search by looking for data either in Google, YouTube, Bing, Amazon or App Store. As you can presume, Keywordtool.io is also good for getting new keyword ideas. 2) Moz Keyword Explorer – assessing keyword difficulty Next step of the process is determining the difficulty of your keyword. Although Keywordtool.io is great at accessing the volume, it doesn’t evaluate keyword difficulty. Instead, you should use Moz Keyword Explorer. This tool is by far the best way to assess how difficult a keyword is. The three basic stats that this tool provides are: Difficulty (how difficult it is to rank higher than the articles which are already ranking) Opportunity (estimated organic click-through-rate) Potential (combination of previous scores) Together with the previously mentioned tool, Keyword Explorer can help us understand what to expect from a keyword. Its algorithms that assess difficulty are quite precise and I would full-heartedly recommend them. The fact that this is a freemium tool makes it that much better. Just register an account with Moz and you’ll get five free searches per day. Besides this basic data, it also shows you other keyword suggestions, SERP analysis and keyword mentions. It is a very practical way to analyze the first page of results and check your competition. 3) MozBar – Assessing domain authority MozBar is something that every blogger should have regardless of whether they are performing keyword research or not. This nifty extension is completely free and you can get it through Google Web Store. It shows you the PA and DA (page and domain authority of websites). Whenever you search for a keyword in Google, you will get a list of all the top competitors. With this extension, you can see page and domain authority score of each one of the top 10 ranking websites without having to click on every page individually. With that, we come to our next point. 4) Manually checking the first page People tend to forget that the process of keyword research isn’t exclusively based on tool usage. Human factor also plays a role as you go to the first page of results and check all the competitors with your own eyes (also known as eyeballing). No matter what you do, I always suggest that you start by checking keyword’s volume and difficulty. It is a necessity that will save you a lot of time later on. But, the numbers can only tell you so much. You need to eyeball each result on the first page and check all the competitors yourself. Are there too many authoritative websites on page one? Do these results have extensive, high quality articles? If so, there is a slim chance of ranking. On the other hand, if you notice a lot of sites with low PA and DA scores, forum results, pages on free blog platforms like wordpress.com or blogspot, it may indicate that the search is lacking quality sources. By creating your own high quality long article, you can easily beat the competition and rank on page one. Don’t forget to build links as you go too which takes us to the last tool. 5) Ahrefs – Assessing links’ power and quantity For now, everything seems ok. You have assessed the stats and your competition doesn’t look too stiff. Awesome! But, there is another, last step of the way. You need to check top 10 competitors’ backlinks. Links still remain the most impactful ranking factor. That being said, you always have to check the links of other pages and see if you can beat that score. I would recommend using Ahrefs as the best tool for this particular purpose. Ahrefs is pretty quick to notice new backlinks. On top of that, it is rather precise when doing so. The biggest issue with this tool is the price. But, if you are serious about keyword research, it is better if you get it. Without assessing the links of your main competitors, you can never know whether you can actually rank for a keyword. Getting links can especially be problematic for brand new websites. As a result, all your efforts may be in vein. There are two things that need to be considered: Quantity of the links Quality of the links When it comes to backlinks, more is not always better. One link from a highly authoritative website can easily trump dozens coming from weaker blogs. Again, it’s all based on free assessment. If a website has a certain number of links that doesn’t necessarily mean that we need the same number to overtake him. There are numerous additional ranking factors that have some impact. But, if the first few results have around 100 links each with average DA over 50, it can tell us where we stand and if the keyword is too difficult to penetrate. Conclusion SEO is not an exact science. It has never been. At best, it can be called a profession of educated guesses. Same goes with keyword research. But, similarly to other professions that are rather intangible (such as stock trading) we need a starting point which can reduce the risk of failure. In the end, there is no point in randomly selecting keywords, right? Keyword research is a process that can be costly. At the same time, if you know the tools, you will be able to perform it for a much lower price. With this detailed guide, I hope you’ve got some basic understanding of what can work and what’s a complete waste of time. Let me know in the comments below.

Giant shield begins sliding over Chernobyl reactor FBI report: Hate crimes against Muslims rose by 67 percent last year Ghosts have invaded the wizard school, and Momo the Cat has to defeat them with well-timed swipes of her magic wand. By Gretel Kauffman, Staff October 31, 2016 Save for later Saved Screenshot About video ads View Caption of Visitors to the Google homepage on Monday may find themselves a bit distracted from their search, thanks to this year's Halloween-themed Google Doodle.  An animated game featuring a black kitten with a magic wand lets googlers draw and swipe their way through five levels, fending off a variety of ghosts by drawing corresponding symbols in a race against the clock. The Doodle follows a series of diverse Halloween-themed predecessors, including a wart-nosed, green-skinned witch mixing unpleasant ingredients in her cauldron, a video tribute to six 1,000-pound pumpkins, and an interactive candy-eating simulation. Recommended: 5 best high-tech Halloween costumes The feline star of this year's Doodle is Momo, a student at the Magic Cat Academy, which serves as the setting for the game.  5 best high-tech Halloween costumes Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 "The original concept for the game involved a magic cat making a soup that was so good, it raised the dead," wrote the creators of the Doodle. But, they continued, "Connecting soup to Halloween proved too abstract, so the team shifted to the idea of a wizard school. This opened the door to a more robust world filled with interesting characters and paw-some themes." While the Magic Cat Academy may, sadly, not exist, Momo herself has some basis in reality. Inspiration for the character was drawn from a real black cat named Momo, the pet of one of the Doodle creators. And though the real-life Momo has likely never studied at an academy or fought off ghosts with a magic wand, scientists still have a limited understanding of the cognitive abilities of our feline companions, with some recently arguing that cats have a better understanding of physics than previously thought.  Regardless, the adventures of animated Momo and her ghostly nemeses have been applauded across the internet.  "It’s a  ridiculously fun way to procrastinate at work, much like I’m doing now," writes Matthew Hughes for The Next Web. "Bravo Google. Bravo."  But be warned, some say: it's harder than it looks.  "It’s easy when one malevolent Casper floats in with a small line above his/her head. But when they all gang up on you, it gets a bit tricky," writes Brinke Guthrie for Digital Trends. "And when your neck is on the line, how the heck are you supposed to type all those symbols when your adrenaline is pumping?"

But the phones themselves would be meaningless without the software that, almost like magic, imbues them with new powers even their creators never thought possible. In that spirit, these are TIME’s 50 best iPhone and Android apps of the year. These are apps that were either released, had a notable redesign, or took off in popularity this year. The list is unranked, as the different functionality of each app makes them impossible to fairly compare. What did we miss? View as 1 of 50 Replay SHARE Venmo Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free It’s rare that a company or an app gets “verbified” the way Google did. That’s exactly what’s happening with money-sending app Venmo, especially among cash-allergic millennials. “Just Venmo me” is an increasingly common refrain at brunch or the bar when it’s time to split the check. Replay SHARE Messages Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free Why include Apple’s default messaging service in this list? Because Messages got a major overhaul in iOS 10, the company’s new iPhone software update. Messages is now a feature-rich messaging platform, complete with third-party apps, stickers, and fun graphic effects like confetti and laser beams. All the new functionality puts it leagues ahead of regular old SMS texting. Replay SHARE Signal Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Which messaging app should you use when you really want to make sure your chats stay secret? Try Signal, an encrypted chat app used by politicians, businesspeople and whistleblowers worldwide. Signal offers complete end-to-end encryption, meaning the company behind the app can’t see what you’re sending and receiving. And it works with your existing contact book, so long as both parties have Signal installed. Replay SHARE Snapchat Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Sure, Snapchat first came out in 2011, but it certainly came into its own this year — especially with the app’s “Chat 2.0” revision in March 2016. With that update, the free disappearing video messaging app laid the groundwork for all sorts of killer features, from geofilters to facial lenses. As a result, Snapchat has not only become one of the most fun apps of the year, but it’s turning into a real business, too. Replay SHARE Pokémon Go Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free The super-powered creatures that triggered a worldwide craze in the 90’s have finally reached the smartphone era. Immediately upon launching in July, Pokémon Go became a massive sensation among seemingly anyone who owned a smartphone. The game tasks players with physically exploring the real world to capture new Pokémon creatures, engaging in battles to claim gyms, and collecting items. It also uses your phone’s camera to make it seem like critters from the game are appearing in your actual surroundings. By cleverly using the technology in our smartphones and tapping into a wildly beloved franchise, game developer Niantic created a smash hit. Replay SHARE WhatsApp Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME In the seven years that WhatsApp has existed, it’s become one of the most widely used communication tools in the world. The Facebook-owned app initially gained popularity because it works on most smartphones and provides a cheaper alternative to SMS for sending messages around the globe. After conducting a survey this April that included 187 countries, research firm SimilarWeb found that WhatsApp was the messaging app of choice in 55% of the world. Earlier this year, the company announced that it surpassed the one billion user milestone, meaning one in every seven people in the world now use WhatsApp. Replay SHARE NPR One Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Unless you drive often, you probably don’t have easy access to an AM/FM radio. Which means it’s hard to find public radio, a great source of news, knowledge and new music. NPR’s new NPR One app can help — it’s basically a customizable public radio station that learns what shows you like and what topics you’re interested in, building a more personal feed over time. You can also use it to listen to NPR podcasts on demand, like Planet Money and the NPR Politics Podcast. Replay SHARE NYT Cooking Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free (web version for Android) Need an easy weekday meal for two? What should you do with all those apples you just picked? How about a slow-cooker recipe? NYT Cooking, from The New York Times, can answer all these questions and more. It offers lots of great recipes searchable by type of meal, prep time and more, often along with beautiful photos. A big bonus: You can save recipes from around the web to this app, making it a clearing house for the meals you’d like to cook. Replay SHARE Spotify Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Android (Free With Ads) Even with Apple, Amazon and Google all taking aim, Spotify is still king of the music streaming apps. A big redesign this year brought a more modern interface that’s still dead simple to use, and gorgeous to boot. One of our favorite features is the mood-based playlists, great when you need something for a rainy day or a morning workout. Replay SHARE A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $4.99 A puzzle game about crafting people made of snow, rolled into being by a blobby black creature surrounded by tiny gardens of white. Players fashion snowballs from strips of snow by swiping to roll, then stacking them in threes, large-medium-small. Only each garden has constraints, from ornamental bird baths and birdhouses to rows of potted plants. Beautifully visualized and scored, A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build is one of the sweetest, smartest puzzlers to grace 2016. Replay SHARE Prisma Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Photo editing apps are generally a dime a dozen, all offering slight variations on the same basic features: Film-style filters, crop and resize tools, red eye reduction and so on. Prisma stands out from the pack by using complex algorithms to transform your images into vibrant and unique works of art. A recent update means it can now do the same for video, too. It takes some practice to know which filters will work the best with which photos, but once you nail it, the payoff is sweet. Replay SHARE White Noise Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Android (Free With Ads) Getting a newborn to sleep, or even just break out of a crying fit, is no easy feat. White Noise helps by flooding baby with soothing sounds, from “Heavy Rain Pouring” and “Ocean Waves Crashing” to “Extreme Rain Pouring” and “Stream Water Flowing.” It’s easy to switch between sounds and adjust the volume to find the mix that works best for baby. Only one downside: The app doesn’t work in the background if you exit it to work on other things. Best to download it onto one of the old disconnected iPhones sitting in a drawer and make that baby’s iPhone. Replay SHARE bitmoji Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Why say it with words when you can say it with stickers? Bitmoji lets you create custom emoji-like stickers complete with an avatar that looks just like you. Stickers have been around for years, but they’re really taking off this year — so much so that Snapchat acquired the company behind Bitmoji for about $100 million in March. Replay SHARE Google Translate Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free One of the coolest pieces of fictional Star Trek tech is the Universal Translator, which lets the Enterprise’s crew understand alien languages. The next best thing is Google Translate, which can take typed phrases, spoken words and even real-world text (like street signs) and transform them into other languages. This year’s big update brought more useful features, like tap-to-translate on Android and offline language packs for the iPhone version, helpful when you’re traveling abroad without a data plan. Replay SHARE Breathe Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME Apple Watch, Free Apple’s Breathe app, for the Apple Watch, walks users through a short set of deep breathing exercises. That might sound silly, but spending a few minutes every day to take some deep breaths can have remarkable benefits for your mental health. Our advice: Disable the daily breathe reminders, stressful in their own right, and open the app only when you need it. Replay SHARE Burly Men At Sea Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $4.99 Brain&Brain’s folklorish adventure is a whimsical romp starring three bearded adventurers that speaks in plaintive accordion tunes and whispers, airy sighs and polyphonic hoots–one that marries quirky activities with starlit encounters and aquamarine serpents plucked from Norwegian myth. It’s a little bit The Old Man and the Sea, a little bit O Brother, Where Art Thou? And a reminder that every journey is a circle, filled with both farce and delight. Replay SHARE Amazon Alexa Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Amazon’s Alexa app turns your smartphone into a remote for your Echo Internet-connected speaker, handy for setup and when you’re too far from your Echo for it to pick up your requests. If you’re an Echo fan, this app is a can’t-miss companion. Replay SHARE Quik Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Modern smartphones can record very high-quality video, but what to do with all that footage? Try Quik, an automatic video editing app that action camera maker GoPro acquired and rebranded this year. Quik takes a bunch of your video footage, identifies the best moments automatically, and sets the whole thing to mood-appropriate music. It’s a great way to add a professional-looking touch to your recordings before putting them on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram. Replay SHARE Mint Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Mint’s an older app, but it’s still the king of budget management software. Mint connects with your various bank accounts, pulling in your spending and income and organizing it into categories that make it easy to track and stick to a budget. It’s great in those situations when you’re contemplating a big purchase and want to see if you can really afford it or not. Replay SHARE Gboard Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free Google’s Gboard app pulls Google’s powerful search engine into text conversations, making it possible to find answers to questions or seek restaurant suggestions without leaving a chat. Google’s search bar is built right into the keyboard, which pulls up results across sites on the Web, locations in Google Maps, and more. The app launched in May, months before Apple released its dramatic overhaul of iMessage in September that added the ability to interact with outside apps within a text thread. Replay SHARE Day One Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, $4.99 Keeping and looking back on a journal can be deeply rewarding, but it’s a tough habit to build. Instead try Day One, a journaling app that makes it easy to quickly record a few thoughts, along with a photo, every day. Unlike paper journals, Day One automatically backs up your notes to the cloud, helping preserve your reflections forever. Replay SHARE Crashlands Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $4.99 Old school roleplaying games dole out abstract rewards like “experience points” so you can make your superpowers a trifle more super. New school ones like Crashlands let you scoop those rewards up off the battlefield, drag them back to your base, then turn them into cool, usable objects. Killer aliens meets goofball storytelling and characters meets a weighty crafting system brimming with hundreds of recipes, Crashlands is everything predictable RPGs aren’t. Replay SHARE Boomerang Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Boomerang takes a burst of still photos, then stitches them together in a short, looping video. The end result is somewhere between a GIF and a stop-motion movie. Tons of fun to play around with, Boomerang is Instagram’s best spinoff app. Replay SHARE Google Trips Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free With its new travel app, Google wants to be the only resource you need when planning your next getaway. Trips scans your Gmail inbox for flight and hotel information, pulling it into a one-stop-shop. It also packs itineraries for a handful of cities, including attractions, restaurants and more. These simple travel guides can be downloaded for offline use, great when you’re abroad without a data plan. Replay SHARE Untappd Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Remember how much fun Foursquare was in its glory days? Well, Untappd is basically Foursquare specifically for beer. It’s great as a sort of “beer journal:” Scanning a bottle or can’s barcode with your smartphone saves it for later, meaning you’ll always be able to remember the name of that new brew you tried last night. Replay SHARE Vevo Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free If you love music videos, you probably know Vevo, which is basically the MTV of the smartphone era. Vevo dropped a big redesign this year featuring a gorgeous interface with your favorite music videos, as well as a discovery feature to help you find rising artists. The app learns your preferences over time, helping to customize your feed. Replay SHARE Alto Mail Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free AOL’s take on gussying up your email service has been around for a few years, but the app’s 2.0 version, launched in September 2016, makes an already smart take on email even smarter. The free app’s new dashboard scrapes all the important information from your emails — shopping receipts, tracking numbers, reservation information, and more — and puts it on virtual cards, for easy gleaning. The app can be used to put a more manageable face on almost any other email service, from IMAP to Gmail, and can also pile up your digital information in “stacks” of photos, files, bills, and other categories. Replay SHARE Houseparty Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free With a user-friendly way to stream video from a mobile phone to everyone in the world, Meerkat turned the Internet on its ear. But that app is so last year (to the point that it’s no longer operational) and in its place Meerkat’s developers have released Houseparty, which is mainstreaming group video chats in almost the same way. Creating what it calls a “synchronous social network,” Houseparty basically lets people video chat with each other, up to eight people at a time. Open the free Android or iOS app, and you’re broadcasting in your own private video chat room. Replay SHARE Netflix’s Fast.com Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME Web app, Free With millions of users sucking down data at home, on mobile and over Wi-Fi, the Internet can be a very slow place. There are dozens of iOS and Android apps to measure your speeds, but they all seem to have an air of unreliability. Fast.com, a web app put out by Netflix, loads quicker than a Craigslist directory on whatever device, whichever operating system, and wherever you are. So from the boardroom, to the bathroom, to the backyard, you’ll always know if you’re down to download. Replay SHARE Nuzzel Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Launched at the tail end of 2015, this free Android and iOS app is a vital app for keeping pace with Twitter’s endless stream of information. Syncing up with your social networks, Nuzzel keeps track of the most tweeted links by the accounts you follow and provides a roundup of all the associated tweets. Ideal for news hounds or anyone who closely follows trends on the Twitterverse, it’s become a must-use over the past 12 months. Replay SHARE Reddit Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Unofficial Reddit apps existed before this year, but the official take makes the front page of the Internet even easier to use and browse than it is on a computer. Longtime Redditors may disagree (they’re never short on opinions), but the app’s intuitive interface is good for new users, making it easier to dive into topics and communities. The communications tab pulls messages, comments, replies and mentions into one place for quick access, and the main tab puts the web’s hottest content just taps away. Replay SHARE Sorcery! 4 Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $4.99 The fourth and final installment in studio Inkle’s grand game-book series based on Steve Jackson’s Sorcery! adventures is an easy recommend for admirers of plain brilliant storytelling. No, you needn’t have played the first three, though the delights are that much brighter if you have. Want to see what a choose-your-own-adventure meets immaculate illustrations and artistry meets the opposite of tin-eared writing looks like? Start here. Replay SHARE Streaks Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone (with Apple Watch app), $3.99 Bad habits may be hard to break, but good habits can be even harder to make. This app helps by giving users a gentle reminder ever day — whether its on your phone or your wrist — to develop up to six healthy routines. Pre-loaded with all sorts of activities from drinking more water to walking the dog (and with Apple Health integrations), it’ll help you do all the little things consistently and right. Streaks was launched in 2015, but the app was given a slick 2.0 makeover this year that was so good it garnered the app an Apple Design Award. Replay SHARE Tribe Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free There are a slew of Snapchat-like free video messaging apps on the market. And while they all jockey for position, Tribe does so with a new killer feature: Magic Words. Basically, when a user says a term in his or her video (like a band name, for example) that word — through some back-end Google speech recognition magic — appears on the screen, overlaid on the video as a clickable keyword. Is this enough to put it ahead of the camera-toting pack? It’s early to say for sure, but this one’s worth watching. Replay SHARE Google Allo Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free A new messaging app from Google, Allo is one of the first products to incorporate the firm’s new artificially intelligent aide, the Google Assistant. Allo has a few limitations — there aren’t any third-party apps and there’s no desktop companion, for instance. But Allo earns a spot on our list because of the potential of the Google Assistant. Right now, it’s pretty good at handling basic questions and surfacing recommendations within chats. But when and if it gets smarter, it could be truly brilliant. Replay SHARE Microsoft Pix Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free Microsoft is pitching Pix as a replacement for the iPhone’s standard Camera app. Pix, which launched in July, uses artificial intelligence to recognize the subject of an image and adjust camera settings in real time. If you’re snapping a photo in well-lit conditions, it’ll create a GIF-like video loop when it detects motion. Unlike many other photo apps, Pix offers helpful enhancements rather than gimmicky features, all with little effort on the user’s part. Replay SHARE Picniic Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free Picniic is a sort of Swiss Army Knife for keeping your family organized: it’s a shared to-do list, calendar, and event manager all in one. Within the app, users can assign tasks on the to-do list to specific family members and take note of the last time a certain family member was heard from. It’s a bit similar to another app called Cozi, but Picniic offers a few extras, including a newsfeed-style stream of updates and an encrypted storage locker for keeping personal family information. Replay SHARE Swift Playgrounds Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free There are dozens of apps, games, and toys designed to help kids learn the building blocks of computer programming. But few of these apps do so by having players write lines of actual code, as Apple’s Swift Playgrounds does. The iPad app challenges participants to input strings of characters written in Apple’s Swift language to complete puzzles. Aspiring developers can also write their own code in a blank document and export it into Xcode, Apple’s software for creating apps. “We’re not hiding code, or running away from the fact that it is code,” Wiley Hodges, director of tools and technologies product marketing for Apple, previously told TIME about the app. Replay SHARE Pocket Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free When you see an article you want to read but don’t have time at the moment, you can save it to Pocket and savor it later. It downloads articles in a clean, readable format so you can read anything without an Internet connection. Add-ons for desktop browsers mean you can save stories from your work computer and read them on your way home. Replay SHARE Waze Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Google Maps and Apple Maps are fine, but neither will make you the master of defeating traffic like Waze. Acquired by Google in 2013 for a reported $1.3 billion, Waze collects data about traffic jams, construction and other issues and displays them to other drivers in a given area. It’s also great at finding little-known shortcuts to save you precious minutes, mileage and gas money. Replay SHARE Reigns Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $2.99 Swipe left or right, that’s all there is to Reigns, an ingenious, dichotomous Tinder-like, only about ruling a kingdom instead of speed-dating. There are no roads less traveled, only left or right turns, yes or no answers to questions of medieval monarch-dom, as you attempt to balance your kingdom’s needs along idiosyncratic, ever-forking roads. If your idea of choose-your-own nirvana involves minimalist, binary survivalism (your goal is to stay alive), Reigns is one of the coolest stripped-down, rapid-play angles on the genre in years. Replay SHARE Super Stickman Golf 3 Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Golf and stickmen? Really? Unqualifiedly. It’s the adventurist allure of putt-putt, the ballistic physics of Angry Birds and the zany level design of 2D platformers like Super Mario Bros. rolled into one. After two forays to hone their ingenious little mashup, this is the iteration of Noodlecake Studios’ series to own, the one that brings it all together while adding the option to put English on the ball. Even if like me the thought of playing real golf makes you recoil, this is the stick-and-ball-swatting game for you. Replay SHARE Bandsintown Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Ah, the time-old question: “Any good bands in town tonight?” Get your answer with Bandsintown, which analyzes your music listening habits and alerts you when your favorite performers are in your area. There’s also a calendar display that lets you check out who’s playing on a given date in case you’d prefer to check out something new for a change. Replay SHARE Insight Timer Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Do away with the the stressful blare of your built-in phone buzzer. Insight Timer is really nothing more than a peaceful chime when time’s up, but we find ourselves using it for everything from signaling the end of a meditation session to the completion of roast chicken. Anything’s better than hearing Marimba for the millionth time. Replay SHARE Calorie Counter Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free It’s never easy to count calories, but MyFitnessPal’s Calorie Counter can be a handy helper. Just tell it what you’ve eaten in a given day, and it’ll let you know how many calories you’ve consumed. Tracking that data is an important part of losing weight, which, when it comes down to it, is about burning more calories than you’ve taken in. Replay SHARE Warbits Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, $3.99 Okay, sure, Warbits clearly cribs from classic turn-based strategy game Advance Wars (for Nintendo’s ancient Game Boy Advance, no less). But I can think of no higher praise to lavish on a game that fills a void over a decade wide and generations of overlooked platforms deep. Much more than a clone, Warbits takes the idea that teams of infantry, armor and aerial vehicles are squaring off over moderately sized squarish maps, then adds an online mode that’s pretty much the definition of how to do turn-based, 1v1 or 2v2 strategy on a phone. Replay SHARE Hitlist Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, Free There are incredible airfare deals available and dozens of places we’d love to visit. But finding a reasonable deal takes far more time and effort than it should. Hitlist can help. It combines travel photography with airfare deals, letting you add appealing destinations to your watch list. Then you’ll get alerts when there’s an incredible price on flights. Replay SHARE Beam Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, Free Video game streaming apps like the Amazon-owned Twitch are getting extremely popular — Twitch users watched more than 241 billion minutes of content last year. So it’s not surprising to see younger companies getting in on the action. One of the newbies is Beam, which offers the unique twist of letting viewers impact the game. Audiences on Beam can suggest moves for players, give them challenges, and more. Microsoft acquired the company behind beam in August; it’s now integrating it directly into the Xbox platform. Replay SHARE _PRISM Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone and Android, $2.99 Prism has one of those un-self-aware taglines about “sacred geometry” converging with “the ethereal soul” you can just ignore, then get right to the heart of the matter: It’s a stirring, smart little shape-puzzler set to groovy, hypnotic tunes. Lines and dots you manipulate with your finger adorn shapes that unfurl like polyhedral flowers as you advance, uncloaking incandescent cores. The puzzles are diverting but accessible, ensuring you’ll hang around long enough to appreciate the experience’s gorgeous, trippy ambience. Replay SHARE Meditation Studio Photo Illustration by Tyler Essary for TIME iPhone, $3.99 A well-designed gateway app to a serious daily meditation practice. Great for beginners, the app has more than 200 guided meditations of varying lengths organized around whatever you need—sleep, confidence, stress and anxiety relief—and it gives you a perfect little zen break wherever you are.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Color me impressed. The Google Pixel only began arriving on the doorsteps of consumers earlier this month, and now it’s already rooted thanks to Chainfire. Chainfire posted the solution on Google+ and noted that there was a problem that required some extra legwork in Android 7.1 on the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. Some of it sounds like mumbo-jumbo to me, but the gist of it was that some files that used to exist in one place were moved to another, and Chainfire had to dig around inside the boot image and the kernal to get everything up and running. As a result, folks will need to be booted from fastboot and not flashed. Verizon’s Google Pixel requires a bootloader unlock before rooting. There are some issues that some of you might not like. While Verizon had told everyone that its model of the Google Pixel is the same Google is selling and will receive software updates at the exact same time, it still has a locked bootloader. As a result, you’ll need to unlock it with a tool named dePixel8, but that won’t work after Google deploys the November security update, which means you’ll need to act fast. Rooting your Pixel and Pixel XL can give you near-unlimited control of your smartphone, but it’s not for everyone. Make sure you know what you’re doing and have everything backed up before proceeding.

The carrier is offering new customers a credit of up to $400 and current customers up to $300 when trading in their current smartphone for Google's new devices.  ( Verizon ) Advertisement Google has partnered with Verizon to exclusively offer its new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. The carrier is now offering customers a credit of up to $400 when trading in their current smartphone. Smartphone fans have some new choices of devices from some of the biggest players in the game and wireless carriers are offering very tempting deals in order to get customers to upgrade to the latest and greatest handsets. Free Smartphone Deals Sprint, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile got very creative and announced free iPhone 7 deals to coincide with the launch of Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The deals appear to have worked, as Sprint and T-Mobile announced iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus shattered records during preorders. Free Extras When Purchasing New Smartphones LG announced its new LG V20 in September and all four major U.S. carriers are offering the 5.7-inch phablet on its network. In order to drum up preorders for the device, T-Mobile announced that it would offer customers some free extras in the form of a $200 credit when trading in an older smartphone and a pair of B&O Play premium headphones that normally retail for $149 when preordering the LG V20 from T-Mobile. The LG V20 is one of the only Android smartphones to ship with Google's latest version of Android, Android 7.0 Nougat, which is sure to attract Android fans. Those wanting an even fresher version of Nougat and ability to receive software updates whenever Google releases them can pick up the company's new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Google has partnered with Verizon to exclusively offer the Pixel and Pixel XL on its network. In addition, Google is selling unlocked versions of the smartphone through its online store. While Verizon is the official exclusive carrier of the Pixel and Pixel XL, that isn't stopping T-Mobile from offering Pixel and Pixel XL users a half-off deal when bringing the smartphone to the carrier's network. T-Mobile's announcement looks to have ruffled Verizon's feathers and now the carrier has announced it will offer new customers and current customers a sweet deal when purchasing the Pixel or Pixel XL. Verizon Jumps On Pixel And Pixel XL Deals New Verizon customers can save up to $400 when purchasing the Pixel or Pixel XL when signing up for Verizon's monthly device payment plan. Current Verizon customers can receive up $300 when buying a Pixel or Pixel XL. Here's how Verizon's Pixel and Pixel XL deal works. Add a Pixel or Pixel XL with a monthly device payment plan to your cart and complete your trade-in appraisal during checkout. Eligible smartphones for the $300 trade-in value are the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge/edge+, HTC M9, iPhone 6, LG G4 and LG V10. Within five days you'll receive a box to return your old smartphone to Verizon. New customers will get an electronic gift card within two weeks and current Verizon customers will receive account credits in one to two billing cycles.

Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides Politico Morning Tech A daily download of technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley Subscribe Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Thiel talks Trump support in D.C. speech today By Li Zhou 10/31/16 10:00 AM EDT With help from Tony Romm, Adam Behsudi and Alex Byers TODAY: PETER THIEL GOES TO WASHINGTON — Donald Trump's most prominent tech industry supporter is in D.C. today, and he’s slated to speak about the election at the National Press Club at 11 a.m. In an interview with The New York Times this weekend, Thiel said he hopes the event will have “the give-and-take of debate.” He added: “Obviously, I’ll get some very tough questions about Trump. But I thought the best way to advance the discussion was not to have some completely contrived format. The future of this country depends on us engaging with the tough questions.” Story Continued Below — Thiel has been a delegate for Trump, spoken at the GOP convention on his behalf and donated more than $1 million to help Trump get elected. His backing of the GOP nominee has riled many of his colleagues in Silicon Valley, given Trump’s incendiary rhetoric and silence on many tech issues. But, as Thiel told The Times: “We’re at such a crucial point that you have to overlook personal characteristics.” We’re tracking. MAJOR PALANTIR RULING EXPECTED, TOO — As Thiel makes his appearance in Washington today, a court could rule on a lawsuit Palantir, a company he backs, brought against the U.S. Army over the bidding process for data intelligence technology used on the battlefield, reports Bloomberg. Palantir, a data analytics firm, says the U.S. Army canceled tests designed to showcase the range of its technology.

WATCH FOR COMEY’S NEXT MOVE ON CLINTON EMAILS — FBI Director James Comey is under intense pressure from both presidential campaigns to provide more information as soon as possible on the new trove of emails which he says may be “pertinent” to the agency’s probe of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. But with little more than a week to go before Election Day, the question is whether there will be enough time for investigators to analyze a cache of emails said to number in the tens of thousands or more. Writes POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “It seems impossible that a full analysis will be completed by Election Day on Nov. 8 because, if potentially classified messages that haven’t been found before are located, they will have to be farmed out to various intelligence agencies for classification review. That interagency process often takes months.” — On Sunday, DOJ got a search warrant to conduct an extensive review of the emails — which, sources told Josh, were found on a laptop belonging to former Congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, as part of an unrelated probe into whether Weiner exchanged sexually explicit messages with an underage girl. Comey’s letter to GOP congressional leaders on Friday, acknowledging discovery of the new emails, rocked the presidential campaign and led to widespread criticism of his decision to publicize the information at such an early stage in the investigative process on the penultimate Friday before Election Day. Josh adds: “Justice Department officials pressed quickly for the warrant once they learned of the messages and are trying to organize a quick review of the emails, a U.S. official told POLITICO.” TRUMP SLAMS TWITTER, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK — The Republican nominee on Sunday slammed several tech platforms in a tweet that accused the sites of suppressing news about the FBI investigation into Clinton’s emails. “Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!” he wrote. In response to the allegation, a Facebook spokesman pointed MT to a segment discussing the tweet on Brian Stelter’s CNN show ‘Reliable Sources,’ which aired on Sunday morning. As part of the segment, Stelter visited Google News, Facebook and Twitter and highlighted how headlines about the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s emails were leading or trending on each site. Google declined to comment, and Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler offered his own tweet in response. ZUCKERBERG’S MEETING WITH PODESTA — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears to have met with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in August 2015, to get Podesta’s advice on philanthropy, according to an email hacked from Podesta’s Gmail account and released by WikiLeaks. “Thanks for sharing your experiences with CAP and some of the choices you made as you put the organization together,” Zuckerberg wrote to Podesta, apparently referring to the Center for American Progress. “I hope it's okay if I reach out as my thinking develops to get your ideas and reactions.” Another email that MT previously covered seemed to show Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg connecting the two for a conversation. SONY, SONGWRITERS, PUBLISHERS CUT DEAL ON CRB — Music publishers and songwriters were incensed that Sony Music Entertainment (a record label) was getting involved in a Copyright Royalty Board battle between music publishers and streaming services — but Sony, the National Songwriters Association International, and the National Music Publishers Association announced a settlement Friday in which Sony will withdraw from the fight. As part of the deal, NMPA and major record labels (including Sony) are submitting a proposed settlement in a different part of the proceeding that deals with how much labels have to pay publishers to put their songs on CDs and digital downloads. It’ll be up to CRB judges whether to accept the settlement. The battle between publishers and online music services over on-demand streaming royalties continues, however. THE GREAT FIREWALL STILL BURNS — USTR broke new ground by listing Chinese internet censorship as a trade barrier for the first time in the 2016 National Trade Estimates report. Seven months later, China’s filtering of cross-border internet traffic and blocking of websites remains a problem, the Computer & Communications Industry Association said in its filing. China has blocked sites including Facebook, Picasa, Twitter, Tumblr, Google search and Dropbox, potentially costing the firms “billions of dollars as they are pushed out of the market,” CCIA said. “Numerous scholars have argued that China’s actions violate WTO rules mandating open access and equitable treatment between foreign and domestic firms.” TRANSITIONS — Allison Cullin has left her role as a professional staff member on the Senate Commerce Committee and is joining Amazon’s public policy transportation team, in November. ... Amy Storey, a vice president of public affairs at CTIA, is leaving the organization after nearly eight years to start her own consulting firm.

The letter, led by the National Association of Manufacturers, stressed the “urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions and to bolster the promise of America.” To #BeTheSolution, let’s start with infrastructure, a bipartisan priority. Let’s rebuild not just our transportation infrastructure but also modernize our energy infrastructure, and pipelines, and broadband infrastructure—to boost America’s quality of life. Less than 1/2 of households in the bottom quintile of the economy have high-speed broadband. With “Building To Win,” we can build a stronger, more inclusive economy.

He likes this bike rack because most of his classes are in the Tanner Building. (Claire Anderson) BYU students have started posting reviews on Google Maps for bike racks around campus in recent months. Elias Flores, a BYU urban and regional planning graduate, helps with the Provo Bicycle Committee. Flores calls himself “a pretty big advocate of biking.” Flores helped start an event at BYU called Y-Bike, which happens every semester at Brigham Square or the JFSB quad, as part of his capstone project. Y-Bike is an event where bike organizations fix bikes and talk about bike safety. Flores said he realized there was a need for better bike racks around campus during his capstone project, so he also helped install maintenance stations at the JKB, the ASB, the RB and the Clyde Building. “From then I started realizing bike racks are pretty important,” Flores said. “I tried to start a review for the underground bike facility at the LSB.” He noticed there were other bike racks receiving ratings as well. These ratings are based on proximity to students’ classes for the most part. “(The comments are) pretty funny, well thought out, very articulated,” Flores said. Flores joined in on the fun and wrote a review for the JKB bike rack. He gave the bike rack three stars and wrote, “Cool bike rack. Not as chill as the Talmage Building bike rack. TBBR has more chill.” Flores liked the Talmage Building bike rack because he had most of his classes at the JFSB. “The bike racks there were closer to where I need to go on occasion,” Flores said. “At times, because it was such a popular place to park your bike, I would run into people I know.” BYU marketing senior Preston Tiegs also wrote a review for the JKB bike rack. He wrote, “The second-best covered bicycle rack on campus. (The LSB has the best one).” Tiegs started writing Google reviews in order to get one terabyte of drive space. Google awarded points for uploading photos to Google Maps, writing reviews and correcting mistakes, according to betanews.com. “I was on a quest to review over 200 places on Google Maps … and I was running out of places to review,” Tiegs said. Information technology sophomore Nate Kelley also wrote a bike rack review for free drive space on Google. Kelley wrote, “Talmage bike rack, that’s all I’ve got to say.” Kelley said he and his friend submitted reviews for restaurants in Provo for about three hours. As they scrolled on Google Maps toward campus, they saw the bike rack reviews. “We were like, ‘Man this is hilarious, you can review the bike rack.’ So we submitted some funny reviews,” Kelley said. Kelley and his friend even created a couple of bike rack reviews in order to receive more points for drive space. These reviews eventually gained so much attention that KSL posted an article about them. Tiegs also thought the coverage of bike rack reviews was pretty funny. “I think it shows the state of the news here in Provo,” Tiegs said. Flores said he doesn’t think many people are looking at the bike rack reviews, even though they have gained some media attention. However, he hopes the attention will lead to more students riding their bikes to school. “People might start to connect the dots, ‘Oh there’s a bicycle rack, maybe I should start riding my bike to campus,'” Flores said. Kelley also hopes more students will ride their bikes to school. “I kind of like the culture of a biking community,” Kelley said. “I like the environmental factor and that it saves money.” Tags: ASB, bike racks, Clyde Building, Elias Flores, google maps, JKB, Justin Elsbury, lsb, Nate Kelley, Preston Tiegs, RB, reviews, Talmage Justin Elsbury 0 0 0 0 0 Related News Freshman friends forever: 19 years,14 girls and one bond 10 unique, local restaurants in Provo Cellular connectivity improved in LaVell Edwards Stadium Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 February 2011 January 2011 September 2010 June 2010 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 December 2004 November 2004 October 2004 September 2004 August 2004 July 2004 June 2004 May 2004 April 2004 March 2004 February 2004 January 2004 December 2003 November 2003 October 2003 September 2003 August 2003 July 2003 June 2003 May 2003 April 2003 March 2003 February 2003 January 2003 December 2002 November 2002 October 2002 September 2002 August 2002 July 2002 June 2002 May 2002 April 2002 March 2002 February 2002 January 2002 December 2001 November 2001 October 2001 September 2001 August 2001 July 2001 June 2001 May 2001 April 2001 March 2001 February 2001 January 2001 December 2000 November 2000 October 2000 September 2000 August 2000 July 2000 June 2000 May 2000 April 2000 March 2000 February 2000 January 2000 December 1999 November 1999 October 1999 September 1999 August 1999 July 1999 June 1999 May 1999 April 1999 March 1999 February 1999 January 1999 December 1998 November 1998 October 1998 September 1998 August 1998 July 1998 June 1998 May 1998 April 1998 March 1998 February 1998 January 1998 December 1997 November 1997 October 1997 September 1997 August 1997 July 1997 June 1997 May 1997 April 1997 March 1997 February 1997 January 1997 December 1996 November 1996 October 1996 September 1996 August 1996 July 1996 June 1996 May 1996 April 1996 March 1996 February 1996 January 1996 October 1994 ABOUT US ADVERTISING BRIMHALL WEBCAM CONTACT US COPYRIGHT / PRIVACY SUBMIT NEWS TIPS UNIVERSE ARCHIVES (PDF) UNIVERSE JOBS Site Login © 2016 The Daily Universe - Brigham Young University

Especially if it seems too good to be true. Why? Look no further than Donald Trump’s Twitter account. Trump claimed Sunday morning that “Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton.” Not only was there no proof of this, but it was pretty easy to disprove. The FBI email inquiry was at the top of Google News; FBI director James Comey’s name was at the top of Facebook’s “trending” box; and Twitter’s “moments” section had a prominent story about the controversy. Nevertheless, Trump’s wrong-headed “burying” claim was his most popular tweet of the day. About 25,000 accounts retweeted it and almost 50,000 “liked” it, helping the falsehood spread far and wide. The rise of social media has had many upsides, but one downside has been the spread of misinformation. Fake news has become a plague on the Web, especially on social networks like Facebook. As I said on Sunday’s “Reliable Sources” on CNN, unreliable sources about this election have become too numerous to count. So that’s what I recommended a “triple check before you share” rule. New web sites designed to trick and mislead people seem to pop up every single day. For their creators, the incentives are clear: more social shares mean more page views mean more ad dollars. But the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again. Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth. The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition. A recent BuzzFeed study of “hyperpartisan Facebook pages” found that these pages “are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information.” The less truthful the content, the more frequently it was shared — which does not bode well for the nation’s news literacy during a long, bitter election season. “Right-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages,” the BuzzFeed reporting team said. On a few occasions, made-up or highly misleading stories have even snuck into Facebook’s “trending” box — a problem that the company says it is trying to address. In a few cases, Trump aides and family members have themselves been duped by fake news stories, including a hoax version of ABC News with a story headlined “Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: ‘I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump’s Rally.'” A close look at the web site reveals that it is not, in fact, the actual ABC News. But the site tricked Trump’s son Eric Trump in early October. “Finally, the truth comes out,” he tweeted, promoting a link to the bogus story. As soon as I spoke about this on television on Sunday, CNN detractors filled my inbox with messages saying that CNN is the ultimate example of “fake news.” But that’s a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue. Whatever faults CNN has, news organizations small and large try very hard to report the truth. Fake news sites and Facebook feeds, on the other hand, traffic in misinformation. My sense is that there are three buckets of these sites: #1, Hoax sites with totally made-up news headlines that try to trick you; #2, Hyperpartisan sites that aren’t lying, per se, but are misleading, because they only share good news about your political party and bad news about the other party; #3, “Hybrids” that purposely mix a little bit of fact and then a lot of fiction. These sites aren’t going away, so it’s up to Internet users to spot fake news and avoid spreading it. Fact-checking sites like Snopes can help — they are devoted to ferreting out hoaxes and tricks. Josh Stearns, a longtime media activist who now works at Democracy Fund, said newsrooms also have a role to play. “Fact checking has taken center stage in this election, but newsrooms need to go beyond fact checking politicians statements and help debunk viral misinformation too,” he told me. “At a time when trust in media is at an all time low, journalists should call out these fake news stories and help citizens tell fact from fiction.” Trump’s false claim about Google, Facebook and Twitter “burying” bad news about Clinton criticized what he called the “very dishonest media.” Ironically, he was using Twitter to blast Twitter. Trump may have gotten the idea from an inaccurate Zero Hedge blog post alleging a “social media blackout.” The blog post contained false information. I asked the Trump campaign to provide a source for the wild claim, but no one has responded. 40.712784 -74.005941 Filed in: News Topics: facebook, News, social media Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Southern Bank News 3’s Proud Community Partner!

Even though the operating system in itself is very open in nature, there are certain options that are only accessible once the devices are rooted or the bootloader is unlocked. For all those users who were waiting for Google's first self-branded smartphones to get rooted, especially because Nexus phones were extremely root-friendly, the wait seems to be over. The bootloader of both phones (including the Verizon version) can now be unlocked, and the phones can be rooted, with new tools. Before we begin, we must warn our readers that the rooting process requires care, and can be dangerous as a single mistake may lead to a bricked device. Proceed at your own risk. A Google+ user, who goes by the name Chainfire, has developed the tools required for rooting the Pixel smartphones and made the tools and images available for all. In his Google+ post about the rooting, he said, "The images for the Pixels need to be 'fastboot boot'ed, not flashed. After a few minutes (have patience) and a couple of (automatic) reboots, Android should boot fully rooted."Chainfire was able to perform a 'systemless root' by "forcing the kernel to again use the boot image's initramfs as root directory, rather using the files from the system partition, and ignore the dm-verity settings the bootloader insists on," he said in his post. "...This change also requires that the contents of the root directory from the system partition are imported to the boot image, so we can modify these files without modifying the system partition, and thus keep dm-verity happy, should the user wish to keep it enabled," he added. This is how he was able to work around the problem earlier posed by a report on XDA Developers that said that the rooting methods, in their existing form then, could not work Pixel smartphones. As a result of this successful root, users will now be able to install custom ROMs on their Pixel or Pixel XL smartphones, or mess with system-level settings to further customise their devices. Do note, rooted phones sometimes lose access to high-security features like payment systems. In order to download the images and tools, you can head to the links mentioned on Chainfire's Google+ page. It is advised that users carefully read the instructions on the page and keep in mind that this process can potentially brick their device. To recall, the bootloader on the Verizon-sold Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphone is locked, but users can unlock it via the SunShine developers' dePixel8 tool before starting with Chainfire's process.

The price is correctly listed at $129 and it shows up in store, at least at the one location where we have a picture, nera other smart home products such as the Nest smart thermostat and products from Ecobee. While I’m sure many of you are about ready to take a trip to your local Walmart location, you may want to hold off. Apparently, Walmart employees are not allowed to sell Google Home to customers until November 4. I wouldn’t get my hopes up that employees can sell it to you “by mistake” either. Walmart likely has a block in the point-of-sale system for selling Google Home units until Friday. At the very least, this early stock of the Home in stores should help many with deciding on whether to order online and likely wait a few days to get their orders or just buy in store.

This mobile index will act as Google's primary index, and Google will crawl the web from a desktop view as a secondary to the mobile view. But Google is still hard at work at it, like they were over a year ago. Google's Gary Illyes who broke the news a month or so ago at a conference, said this weekend on Twitter that Google is "still figuring out these issues" when it comes to the mobile index. A question was posed to Gary by Alan Bleiweiss about corner cases on the mobile index and Gary said they are working on it. Here is the set of tweets: @AlanBleiweiss sounds like a corner case, but we're still figuring out these issues— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 29, 2016 So do you think Google is months away when many of these corner cases are still open? I am not sure but who knows. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Frank hermer 10/31/2016 04:22 pm Reminder, they crawl my content, build ads around it in the serps plus I spend a load of money with them on adwords.

Nick Ker 11/01/2016 01:08 pm If you think that is funny, you should find some SEO discussions on LinkedIn. They are often started by people with job titles like "Senior SEO Specialist" asking questions like "what are meta tags?" Ben Guest 11/01/2016 01:28 pm Can someone explain why mobile (m.) sites are still being developed? It would seem you would want to either a.) utilize responsive technology if the desktop and mobile versions are the same, or b.) build a mobile app if they are not. "Responsive design is Google’s recommended design pattern." - https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/ Ben Guest 11/01/2016 01:29 pm I too cringe for the client. ;-) BushyTop 11/01/2016 02:57 pm I'm not even seeing consistent Desktop results, mobile is a whole different ball game. Wondering where/when this eventually ends. We've seen nothing stable (traffic, conversions or rank) since late June. Recovering keyword spammer 11/01/2016 03:51 pm I agree the serp positions still seem all over the place. It's starting to look like flux might be permanently baked into the algo now. On the other hand,and even though I feel like a keyword junkie suffering withdrawal, it's a relief in a way not to obsess about individual keyword rankings all the time, like it's the end of the world dropping a couple of places. If they bob around and traffic generally holds up who cares. Also, voice is also going to increasingly change how users search as well, in a much more conversational way rather than the exact money phrases we're used to. no no no 11/01/2016 09:44 pm Talking to computers is creepy. I don't think voice is going to take off soon. It's a bit like smart watches .... in massive decline. Jerry B. 11/02/2016 12:43 am Voice-like search, kind of like good ol' long-tail, is on the rise though. RKS is right to not fret about keywords as long as search is sending traffic that converts. Recovering keyword spammer 11/02/2016 09:34 am As voice search gets more accurate, usage will increase and then it will just become normal for younger people. It will be 'find a reliable plumber near me' rather than 'plumber + location'. Much more difficult to optimise for.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews The (updated) history of Android Follow the endless iterations from Android 0.5 to Android 7 and beyond. by Ron Amadeo - Oct 31, 2016 1:15 pm UTC Login to bookmark 212 Enlarge / Android's home screen over the years, from all sorts of different form factors. It's been more than two years since we originally ran Ron's epic 40,000-word history of the Android operating system, and in that time Android has continued to evolve and add version numbers. Ron has updated the piece with almost 11,000 additional words, bringing the history up to date with info on Kit-Kat, Lollipop, Marshmallow, Nougat, and Android Wear. If you'd like to jump directly to the new section, click right here (or, if you're a subscriber in single-page view, use this link instead). Android has been with us in one form or another for more than eight years. During that time, we've seen an absolutely breathtaking rate of change unlike any other development cycle that has ever existed. When it came time for Google to dive in to the smartphone wars, the company took its rapid-iteration, Web-style update cycle and applied it to an operating system, and the result has been an onslaught of continual improvement. Lately, Android has even been running on a previously unheard of six-month development cycle, and that's slower than it used to be. For the first year of Android’s commercial existence, Google was putting out a new version every two-and-a-half months. Google's original introduction of Android, from way back in November 2007. Looking back, Android's existence has been a blur. It's now a historically big operating system. Almost a billion total devices have been sold, and 1.5 million devices are activated per day—but how did Google get here? With this level of scale and success, you would think there would be tons of coverage of Android’s rise from zero to hero. However, there just isn’t. Android wasn’t very popular in the early days, and until Android 4.0, screenshots could only be taken with the developer kit. These two factors mean you aren’t going to find a lot of images or information out there about the early versions of Android. The problem now with the lack of early coverage is that early versions of Android are dying. While something like Windows 1.0 will be around forever—just grab an old computer and install it—Android could be considered the first cloud-based operating system. Many features are heavily reliant on Google’s servers to function. With fewer and fewer people using old versions of Android, those servers are being shut down. And when a cloud-reliant app has its server support shut off, it will never work again—the app crashes and displays a blank screen, or it just refuses to start. Thanks to this “cloud rot," an Android retrospective won’t be possible in a few years. Early versions of Android will be empty, broken husks that won't function without cloud support. While it’s easy to think of this as a ways off, it's happening right now. While writing this piece, we ran into tons of apps that no longer function because the server support has been turned off. Early clients for Google Maps and the Android Market, for instance, are no longer able to communicate with Google. They either throw an error message and crash or display blank screens. Some apps even worked one week and died the next, because Google was actively shutting down servers during our writing! To prevent any more of Android's past from being lost to the annals of history, we did what needed to be done. This is 25+ versions of Android, a myriad of devices, and lots and lots of screenshots cobbled together in one space. This is The History of Android, from the very first public builds to today.

While 1.0 was the first version to ship on hardware, there were several beta versions only released in emulator form with the SDK. The emulators were meant for development purposes only, so they don’t include any of the Google Apps, or even many core OS apps. Still, they’re our best look into the pre-release days of Android. Enlarge / The emulator’s default qwerty-bar layout running the Milestone 3 build. Ron Amadeo Before whimsical candy code names and cross-promotional deals with multinational food corporations, the first public release of Android was labeled "m3-rc20a"—"m3" standing for "Milestone 3." While Google may not have publicized the version number—and this build didn't even have a settings app to check—the browser user agent identifies this as "Android 0.5." In November 2007, two years after Google acquired Android and five months after the launch of the iPhone, Android was announced, and the first emulator was released. Back then, the OS was still getting its feet under it. It was easily dismissed as "just a BlackBerry clone." The emulator used a qwerty-bar skin with a 320x240 display, replicating an actual prototype device. The device was built by HTC, and it seems to be the device that was codenamed "Sooner" according to many early Android accounts. But the Sooner was never released to market. According to accounts of the early development days of Android, when Apple finally showed off its revolutionary smartphone in January 2007, Google had to "start over" with Android—including scrapping the Sooner. Considering the Milestone 3 emulator came out almost a year after Apple's iPhone unveiling, it's surprising to see the device interface still closely mimicked the Blackberry model instead. While work had no doubt been done on the underlying system during that year of post-iPhone development, the emulator still launched with what was perceived as an "old school" interface. It didn't make a good first impression. At this early stage, it seems like the Android button layout had not been finalized yet. While the first commercial Android devices would use “Home," “Back," “Menu," and “Search" as the standard set of buttons, the emulator had a blank space marked as an "X" where you would expect the search button to be. The “Sooner" hardware prototype was even stranger—it had a star symbol as the fourth button. Enlarge / From left to right: the home screen, an open notification, and the “apps" folder. Ron Amadeo There was no configurable home screen or widgets, just a simple dock of icons at the bottom that could be cycled through or tapped on. While touch screen support worked for some features, Milestone 3 was primarily controlled with a five-way d-pad—an anachronism that Android still supports to this day. Even this early version of Android could do animations. Icons would grow and shrink as they entered and exited the dock’s center window. There was no notification panel yet, either. Notification icons showed up in the status bar (shown above as a smiley face), and the only way to open them was to press "up" on the d-pad while on the home screen. You couldn't tap on the icon to open it, nor could you access notifications from any screen other than home. When a notification was opened, the status bar expanded slightly, and the text of the notification appeared in a speech bubble. Once you had a notification, there was no manual way to clear it—apps were responsible for clearing their own notifications. App drawer duties were handled by a simple "Applications" folder on the left of the dock. Despite having a significant amount of functions, the Milestone 3 emulator was not very forthcoming with app icons. "Browser," "Contacts," and "Maps" were the only real apps here. Oddly, "recent calls" was elevated to a standalone icon. Because this was just an emulator, icons for core smartphone functionality were missing, like alarm, calendar, dialer, calculator, camera, gallery, and settings. Hardware prototypes demoed to the press had many of these, and there was a suite of Google Apps up and running by this point. Sadly, there’s no way for us to look at them. They’re so old they can't connect to Google’s servers now anyway. Enlarge / Milestone 3's menu system in the browser, the wallpaper interface, and the volume control. Ron Amadeo The now-deprecated menu system was up and running in Milestone 3. Hitting the hardware menu button brought up a gray list with a blue gradient highlight, complete with hardware keyboard shortcuts. In the screenshot above, you can see the menu open in the browser. Going to a second level, like the zoom menu, turned the first level of the menu oddly transparent. Surprisingly, multitasking and background applications already worked in Milestone 3. Leaving an app didn't close it—apps would save state, even down to text left in a text box. This was a feature iOS wouldn’t get around to matching until the release of iOS 4 in 2010, and it really showed the difference between the two platforms. iOS was originally meant to be a closed platform with no third-party apps, so the platform robustness wasn’t a huge focus. Android was built from the ground up to be a powerful app platform, and ease of app development was one of the driving forces behind its creation. Before Android, Google was already making moves into mobile with WAP sites and J2ME flip phone apps, which made it acutely aware of how difficult mobile development was. According to The Atlantic, Larry Page once said of the company’s mobile efforts “We had a closet full of over 100 phones, and we were building our software pretty much one device at a time.” Developers often complain about Android fragmentation now, but the problem was much, much worse before the OS came along. Google’s platform strategy eventually won out, and iOS ended up slowly adding many of these app-centric features—multitasking, cross-app sharing, and an app switcher—later on. Enlarge / The dialer screen that pops up when you press numbers on the home screen, an incoming call, and the call conferencing interface. Ron Amadeo Despite not having a dialer icon, Milestone 3 emulator was equipped with a way to make phone calls. Pressing anything on the keyboard would bring up the screen on the left, which was a hybrid dialer/contact search. Entering only numbers and hitting the green phone hardware button would start a phone call, and letters would search contacts. Contacts were not searchable by number, however. Even a direct hit on a phone number would not bring up a contact. Incoming calls were displayed as an almost-full-screen popup with a sweet transparent background. Once inside a call, the background became dark gray, and Milestone 3 presented the user with a surprisingly advanced feature set: mute, speakerphone, hold, and call conferencing buttons. Multiple calls were presented as overlapping, semi-transparent cards, and users had options to swap or merge calls. Swapping calls triggered a nice little card shuffle animation. Enlarge / The contacts list, an individual contact, editing a contact, and the recent calls screen. Ron Amadeo Contacts was a stark, black and blue list of names. Contact cards had a spot for a contact picture but couldn't assign one to the space (at least in the emulator). The only frill in this area was XMPP presence dots to the left of each name in Contacts. An always-on XMPP connection has traditionally been at the heart of Android, and that deep integration already started in Milestone 3. Android used XMPP to power a 24/7 connection to Google’s servers, powering Google Talk, cloud-to-device push messaging, and app install and uninstall messages. Enlarge / The browser’s fake Google homepage, the address bar, and the history interface. Ron Amadeo The browser ran Webkit 419.3, which put it in the same era as Mac OS X 10.4's Safari 2. The homepage was not Google.com, but a hard-coded home.html file included with Android. It looked like Google.com from a thousand years ago. The browser's OS X heritage was still visible, rendering browser buttons with a glossy, Aqua-style search button. The tiny BlackBerry-style screen necessitated a separate address bar, which was brought up by a "go to" option in the browser's menu. While autocomplete didn't work, the address bar live searched your history as you typed. The picture on the right was the History display, which used thumbnails to display each site. The current thumbnail was in front of the other two, and scrolling through them triggered a swooping animation. But at this early stage, the browser didn’t support multiple tabs or windows—you had the current website, and that was it. Enlarge / A video-screengrab-derived Google Maps Photoshop, the directions interface, and the gallery test view. Ron Amadeo From the beginning, Google knew maps would be important on mobile, even shipping a Maps client on the Milestone 5 emulator. That version of Google Maps was the first thing we came across that died from cloud rot. The client can't load information from Google’s servers, so the map displayed as a blank, gray grid. Nothing works. Luckily, for the first screenshot above, we were able to piece together an accurate representation from the Android launch video. Old Google Maps seemed fully prepared for a non-touch device, listing hardware key shortcuts along the bottom of the screen. It’s unclear if places worked, or if Maps only ran on addresses at this point. Hidden behind the menu were options for search, directions, and satellite and traffic layers. The middle screenshot is of the directions UI, where you could even pick a contact address as a start or end address. Maps lacked any kind of GPS integration, however; you can't find a "my location" button anywhere. While there was no proper gallery, on the right is a test view for a gallery, which was hidden in the "API Demos" app. The pictures scrolled left and right, but there was no way to open photos to a full screen view. There were no photo management options either. It was essentially a test of a scrolling picture view. Enlarge / The time picker and calendar, with ridiculous kerning issues, and the vertical list test, featuring Ars. Ron Amadeo There was also no settings app, but we can look at the original time and date pickers, thanks to the API Demos. This demonstrates how raw a lot of Android was: kerning issues all over the place, a huge gap in between the minute digits, and unevenly spaced days of the week on the calendar. While the time picker let you change each digit independently, there was no way to change months or years other than moving the day block out of the current month and on to the next or previous month. Keep in mind that while this may seem like dinosaur remnants from some forgotten era, this was only released six years ago. We tend to get used to the pace of technology. It's easy to look back on stuff like this and think that it was from 20 years ago. Compare this late-2007 timeframe to desktop OSes, and Microsoft was trying to sell Windows Vista to the world for almost a year, and Apple just released OS X 10.5 Leopard. One last Milestone 3 detail: Google gave Ars Technica a shoutout in the Milestone 3 emulator. Opening the “API Demos" app and going to "Views," "Focus," then "Vertical" revealed a test list headlined by this very Website. Enlarge / The new emulator skin that comes with Milestone 3, RC37a, which uses a more modern, all-touchscreen style. Ron Amadeo Two months later, in December 2007, Google released an update for the Milestone 3 emulator that came with a much roomier 480×320 device configuration. This was tagged "m3-rc37a." The software was still identical to the BlackBerry build, just with much more screen real estate available.

Google Halloween Doodle 2016 Launches Cute Game With Ghosts And A Magic Cat 30 October 2016, 5:52 pm EDT By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Google - Five Fascinating Facts About The Search GiantNow Playing Internet In A MinuteNow Playing Google launched a fun new game for Halloween, so head over to the Magic Cat Academy and help Momo fight ghosts. Ghastly fun guaranteed.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google Doodle is celebrating Halloween with an adorable interactive game featuring ghosts and a magic cat, straight from the Magic Cat Academy. Trick-or-treaters may want to spend some extra time on Google's homepage this Halloween and play the cute Magic Cat Academy game for some ghastly fun, drawing symbols to cast away ghosts. As expected from a Google Doodle, it's not an overly complicated game. The star of the game is magician cat Momo, which sits at the center of the game and casts magic spells. Ghosts are creeping toward Momo, but you can scare them away by drawing simple shapes on the screen. "This year's Halloween Doodle follows freshman feline Momo on her mission to rescue her school of magic," Google notes. "Help her cast out mischievous spirits by swiping in the shape of the symbols above the ghosts' heads. And you'd better pounce fast — the ghost that stole the master spellbook is getting away!" Google further explains that four teams worked to develop the game, handling different parts: art, engineering, production and music production. The whole game is set in a school environment — it is, after all, an academy for magic cats — and players have to work their way through five levels, trying to fight off the ghosts haunting Momo before they run out of time. The five levels are set in the school's library, classroom, cafeteria, gym and the rooftop. Google notes that initially it had many ideas for the game, and the original concept revolved around a magic cat that made a soup so awesome that it raised the dead. Google ultimately decided to go for something less abstract and opted for a wizard school instead. The company toyed with many other ideas such as having players draw elaborate symbols but eventually decided to keep it simple and launch a "short game against the clock." Each ghost that creeps toward Momo has symbol or series of symbols above its head. Players have to draw those symbols on the screen in due time before the ghosts reach Momo. The game starts out simple and gets more complicated as you advance, with longer series of symbols and more ghosts approaching Momo at a faster pace. The result is fun, engaging and adorable, and players can share their results via social media or email once they finish the game. As for the muse for the game, the real-life Momo is a cool black cat that belongs to (read: owns) doodler Juliana Chen.

Google’s Next Daydream VR Headset Surfaces in Patent Filling GO The patent reveals a new design for the headset Oct 31, 2016 13:00 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  During the launch event of the Pixel smartphones in early October, Google also announced the new Daydream VR headset. The Daydream View VR headset came with a controller that features motion controls and two buttons. Daydream View works together with the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, and it’s made out of fabric rather than plastic. The headset is offered in three colors and weighs around 220 grams. It also comes with a replaceable face mask that can be hand-washed. The headset has a reduced number of straps and clips, and users can put it on without having to take off their glasses. It seems that Google is contemplating a change in the headset’s design, as a recently patent application reveals. Patently Mobile found out that Google might be working on the next-generation virtual and/or augmented reality headset, as a patent application was recently filed at the US Patent & Trademark Office. Google’s upcoming Daydream VR might have built-in headphones The application reveals that the upcoming system will have built-in headphones for enhancing the user’s gaming and VR experience. The headset will also have more controls for adjusting the device’s lenses and lighting conditions. In addition, it seems that Google may create an all-new VR tracking system for allowing users to wear the headset and move around in the room while playing games, so that their VR experience is more realistic. Google’s next generation headset will be able to track the user’s position in real world and perform a process for transitioning out of the virtual world generated on the platform. The filling also shows that Google may be working on a new method of operating an audio visual system that can generate a virtual experience which may include activating a tracking device. The processor may be set to translate the detected real world movement of the user electric device into virtual movement. The system will also be able to make users avoid obstacles in the room by using a gradual transition out of the virtual world. This is just a patent application for now, and it remains to be seen if Google will actually incorporate the technology in an upcoming Daydream VR headset. #Google#Daydream View#Controller#Pixel#Pixel XL subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Pixel and Pixel XL Sold Through Google Store Will Be Rootable Google Announces Android 7.1 Developer Preview Google Pixel and Pixel XL Are Verizon Exclusive in the US Google Announces Daydream View with Controller and $79 Price Tag OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2 Mozilla Firefox 50.0 Now Available for Download, Brings Built-in Emoji on Linux    Google's patent application for a new Daydream VR headset New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Pictures and Specs of Google's Canned Project ARA Smartphone Leaked Out more on: Project Ara i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Tags : Verizon-Verizon+ Android-Android+ Rooting & Modding-Rooting & Modding+ Google-Google+ Good news this morning for those modders and power users who like to have a completely customizable phone. The Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL have been rooted. That means that custom ROMs can be employed on the two models. Chainfire developed the tool to root the new Google handsets. He points out that "the images for the Pixels need to be 'fastboot boot'ed, not flashed. After a few minutes (have patience) and a couple of (automatic) reboots, Android should boot fully rooted." Rooting the phone in the U.S. means dealing with a Verizon bootloader that is not unlockable. But a tool called the dePixel8 will handle that task, allowing you to root either Pixel model. One important note. The dePixel8 will stop working once the November security update is disseminated. This means that if you want to unlock the bootloader on your Pixel or Pixel XL handset, you better do the deed before the security update is pushed out. And yes, the tool will work with other Pixel models without an unlockable bootloader such as the units sold overseas by EE. If you've never rooted your phone before, be careful. One slip up and you now own an expensive brick. That is why even those who have rooted their phone before know to keep some stock firmware lying around just in case a life saver is needed. Flashing back to stock will get you out of most trouble. Also, keep in mind that you will lose your warranty just for unlocking the bootloader, and miss out on updates sent while your phone is rooted. If still interested in proceeding, click on the sourcelinks. All of the developers are offering their hard work for free, so you might want to send a donation. Money sent for the dePixel8 will go to support the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Yet it's become much less of one for me. Why? Because the ads that Google places on web pages are no longer interesting. What a relief! By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | October 31, 2016 -- 12:15 GMT (05:15 PDT) | Topic: Google Google is a large advertising business. They sell ads that use the information you give them when searching to let advertisers target you with offers that you will find appealing. It works - and that's the problem. A year ago I made DuckDuckGo (DDG) my default search engine. They bill themselves as the "search engine that doesn't track you" and asks if you are "ready to take back your privacy?" I like that. Special Feature Security and Privacy: New Challenges As big data, the IoT, and social media spread their wings, they bring new challenges to information security and user privacy. Read More Now, DDG isn't an exact replacement for Google, but they're close. I almost always find what I'm looking for with them, but it can be more work. The biggest feature I miss is that you can't specify a search period, such as the last week or year, or a date range. But only a few times in the last year have I been forced to go to Google for a difficult search. A year of living privately It took a couple of months before I noticed that my ad experience was changing, both online and in my spam folder. I use SpamSieve, an excellent spam filter for Apple Mail, to sort the 500 or so emails I get every day. Now, most of the online ads I see are either irrelevant to me or are related to my last search on Amazon. This is wonderful. I'm not sure how Google influences spam, but it has defintely changed. Now my spam folder is filled with spam that I don't care about. That makes it easy to go through hundreds of spam emails and not get hooked by an enticing subject line. What's more The types of untargeted ads are suggestive of the underlying demographic markers that advertisers - and Google - use to slice and dice their product- you. Gender. Possibly because of my name, I now get lots of spam and webpage ads targeted to women. I run ad blockers on some of my devices, but it sure makes web surfing easier when the ads are ones I will never care about. Ads for problems I don't have. Breast enlargement? Makeup secrets of the stars? Life insurance? Delete! Ads for interests I don't have. Woodworking? Russian beauties? Delete! The Storage Bits take My problem with targeted ads is that they work. I'm a little ADD so maintaining focus is often a challenge. For privacy and security, change these iOS... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 13 NEXT PREV Given the advantages of a Google-free existence, I have to wonder what Google is costing the world economy. If interesting ads cause each Internet user to spend an extra five minutes a day on non-productive shopping, with almost 3 billion Internet users today, that's 15 billion minutes or over 28,000 person years of productivity every day. It probably pales beside the time wasters on Facebook, which I am not on, but it raises a larger issue. When your demographics are packaged and sold, Google places you in a statistical box that advertisers bid on. The ads that target you remove your volition from the inputs in your life. You are a passive receiver, not an active searcher, defining and refining your own needs and desires. Free will may be a delusion, but it's a delusion I like. How does DuckDuckGo make money? Like Google they sell ads, but the ads at the top of their search results are directly related to the search that you made. They don't aggregate your data and sell it advertisers. If removing the friction of targeted ads appeals to you, try DuckDuckGo for sixmonths. I think you'll like it. Courteous comments welcome, of course.

Instead of a simple graphic celebrating October 31st, Google has created an entire game surrounding a cat called Momo. In proper Halloween fashion, the game has you using magic (via your computer mouse) to fight against ghosts invading the Magic Cat Academy where Momo studies. The innovative little game has you creating patterns with your mouse to cast spells that ward off the ghosts. Read More Google Daydream View VR hands-on review: Finding fantastic beasts with Google's new headset Google Google's Halloween game doodle lets you fight ghosts with a spell-casting cat called Momo As Momo defeats a ghost, you'll see the score accumulating on the right hand side of the screen. And you'll need to swipe your mouse in just the right way to cast the spell properly. Google has a history of dropping small games into its doodles - and many of them are still available to play. How to play Breakout You'll need to use Google Image Search to find this new version of Atari's classic block-breaking game. Read More Simply type in "Atari Breakout" and watch what happens. You'll be able to use your computer mouse to control the moving platform. How to play Pac-Man This classic chomping arcade game was actually the basis of a playable Google Doodle a few years back. One of Google's most popular doodles ever, it's been preserved in the search engine's archives for you to call up and plat at a moment's notice. Read More Just go to Google and type in "Pacman" and it will appear at the top. Use your keyboard to gobble up all the dots and avoid the ghosts. Chrome's hidden dinosaur game The game only appears when you've lost your mobile or WiFi connection and involves Google's tiny digital dinosaur. Tapping on the T-rex will load the Flappy bird-style game that you can play during your internet down time. The dinosaur will be transported to the desert and begin running - your job is to help it jump obstacles by tapping the screen. On the desktop version of Chrome, you can jump by pressing the space bar. Read More As the speed increases, the game gets gradually harder. Useful for the next time you're caught without signal.

In his welcoming address HE Ahmed bin Rakkad Al Ameri, Chairman of SBA said: “The cultural renaissance in the UAE has its roots in Sharjah, which was started and is being led by His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah.” Al Ameri added: “Publishers are a key pillar in the process of generating and disseminating knowledge, and in that sense the Professional Programme is integral not only to Sharjah International Book Fair, but to the future of reading and education here in the UAE. We cannot ignore the challenges that are faced by the Arab publishing industry today, especially in the wake of new realities being posed by the digital revolution. We hope that this programme leads to valuable strategies and recommendations, as well as intensified collaborations with global publishers, which will continue to push the wheel of publishing forward in Sharjah, UAE and the rest of the world”.   The first session, titled ‘Google Play Books in MENA’, conducted by Alexander Bregman, Strategic Partnerships EMEA, Google, focused on how they have leveraged the existing potential in the Middle Eastern markets for a successful penetration of digital books. Google Play Books was launched in January 2016 in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, Egypt and Bahrain and has been doing increasing well since.    Advertisement Taking this discussion a step ahead, Michael Tamblyn, President and CEO of Rakuten Kobo, addressed a session on ‘What Brings the Future? Building an eBook Marketplace’, detailing how they want to make the eBook market in this part of the world more robust by actualising their motto of facilitating readers to be able to carry their entire reading life on one device wherever they go. He said: “We want digital publishing to be a revolution that happens with Arab publishers rather than something that happens to them, understanding the existing market dynamics and customising our offerings to fulfil their needs. Non-fiction, women’s fiction, romance and children’s literature have the biggest digital readership in MENA, where sales have undergone a 100 percent increase compared to 2015. Other important considerations are literacy levels, disposable income and a culture of book buying.” The new and fast emerging trend of listening to audiobooks was highlighted in a talk given by Shadi Al Hasan, CEO and Founder of Flagship Projects. Highlighting how the Holy Quran was the first audiobook made available to the world in Arabic language in the 60’s, he shared how his company has been collaborating with the Swedish entity Storytel, the world’s first mobile streaming audiobook service, to develop and harness a new audiobook strategy for creating a strong market for the same throughout the Arab world.  A panel discussion on the ‘Overview of Arab Publishing’, chaired by Marcia Lynx-Qualey, Arab literature blogger and translator; and Tamer Said, Managing Director of Kalimat Group elucidated the need for identifying and executing more robust commissioning, marketing and distribution systems, which will then give life to the vibrant literature and culture this region can offer to the world. They stressed on the need to employ systems that will allow not just regional readers but Arabic readers across the world easier access to their literature. A unified bestseller list, regular publisher recommendations, updated and uniform statistics on the growth of print and e-publishing in the Arab world, TV ads on books and frequent book reviews in newspapers, increasing interest in Arab literature by translating more and more titles into English and other foreign languages were some of the improvements suggested by the panel. The last panel discussed access, rights and translation in Arab publishing. The fact that the Translation Grant, SIBF and other initiatives have helped increase local and regional readership considerably were highlighted, and the need for international publishers to be more flexible on the financial aspects of a book deal or a translation rights discussion – since the Arab markets are still nascent as compared to their Western counterparts – were stressed upon in order to establish more long-lasting partnerships.  The SIBF Translation Grant was introduced and prospective grant seekers were encouraged to submit their applications. The programme also witnessed the beginning of matchmaking sessions – a valuable platform that participating publishers from around the world made use of to connect, collaborate, exchange best practices and ideas, in preparation of signing new partnership agreements. -Ends- © Press Release 2016 © Copyright Zawya.

 Martin Sorrell says WPP will spend $5 billion with Google this year — and they're better to deal with than Facebook Lara O'Reilly Oct. 31, 2016, 8:08 AM 16,832 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hear more from WPP's Chief Executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, at Business Insider's IGNITION: Future Of Digital this December in New York City.  Tickets On Sale Now »   Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP CEO speaking at the company's third-quarter analyst meeting.WPP WPP will spend at least $5 billion (£4.1 billion) of its clients money on Google ads this year, the advertising agency holding company's CEO Sir Martin Sorrell said on its third-quarter earnings call on Monday. That figure is up from $4 billion (£3.2 billion) WPP spent on behalf of its client across Google's properties in 2015. Sorrell said the relationship with Google is "good," adding: "Google search and YouTube video continue to be very powerful mediums, particularly in high-penetration TV markets." He said that some of the issues Google has had to deal with, regarding regulation and taxation in Europe in particularly, "probably made Google more responsive" in the way it works with advertising companies and takes their feedback on board. "Maybe even the success of Facebook, in building out a video business and a mobile business, quote-unquote 'catching up with Google' probably makes Google a little bit more responsive [too]," Sorrell said. As for Facebook — where WPP spent $1 billion (£830 million) in 2015 — the relationship isn't quite as good. Sorrell said: "Facebook, I think because it has been so successful, is probably, to be blunt, a little bit more difficult to deal with. I think that's not a view we are alone in having. Others would too if you ask around. My view is that is going to change because they will see the benefit and the merit." In terms of improvements, Sorrell said he'd like to see Facebook open up more access to its data in order to justify why advertisers should be increasing their mobile and video budgets and placing them on its platform. Earlier on the call, Sorrell said of Facebook's data: "Facebook puts great emphasis on outcomes and ROI [return on investment]. The data has to be independent data that justifies the position. Facebook has a very close arrangement with Nielsen ... something increasingly we are going to ensure that comScore [in which WPP has a near-20% stake] has that similar relationship with Facebook to provide alternate data because clients are investing now a lot of money." He pointed out that Unilever CMO Keith Weed has called on digital media companies, including Facebook, to provide what he calls the "3Vs" — viewability, verification, and value — to prove they are being transparent about the success of ad campaigns on their platforms. Sorrell said: "And he's on [Facebook's client] council, saying you have to have better measurement!" In Facebook's defense, Weed also publicly commended Facebook last year for striking a partnership with analytics firm Moat, which now acts as an independent third-party that measures its video ads. And in September this year, Facebook announced a set of new partnerships — including with Nielsen Catalina and Oracle Data Cloud — to add to the growing number of third-party measurement firms that work with the platform. WPP beat analysts' expectations for its third quarter, with reported revenue jumping 23.4% to £3.61 billion ($4.7 billion) in the three months to the end of September, with the gains largely thanks to a weak pound. On a constant currency basis, revenues rose 7.6%. The company said like-for-like revenue growth in the UK slowed to 2.1% in this quarter, compared to 3.5% in the second quarter — which it remarked could reflect "the first signs of Brexit anxiety."

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Google's neural networks develop their own encryption methods By Anthony Spadafora Researchers at Google Brain have taught two neural networks how to keep their messages secret from a third neural network. Shares In an effort to demonstrate how AI could be used to boost encryption, researchers at Google taught two neural networks how to communicate with one another while keeping their conversation secret from a third. Researchers at the company's deep learning initiative, Google Brain, have successfully taught two neural networks given the nicknames “Alice” and “Bob” to secretly communicate with one another while keeping the details of their conversations from one called “Eve.” Last week the team behind this endeavor, published a paper detailing the process of the experiment and its results. Neural networks operate by searching through copious amounts of data in order to find patterns and connections that are in turn used in their future computations. Google Brain was effectively able to prove that artificial intelligence (AI) could be harnessed to deal with data security and the increased difficulty of encrypting and decrypting critical messages. The researchers began their experiment by having Alice send Bob a 16-digit encrypted message that was made up of ones and zeroes. These two neural networks began communicating with one another using a shared key but as their correspondence continued, the way in which their messages were encrypted began to change as well. The rival neural network tasked with deciphering the messages, EVE was able to decrypt the first 7,000 messages that Alice and Bob sent to one another. However, eventually she was unable to continue to do so as the neural networks continually changed tactics with the aim of keeping their messages secret from Eve. Martin Abadi and David G. Andersen, two of the researchers who worked on the project, highlighted how they were able to teach neural networks how to encrypt and decrypt messages, saying: “We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet confidentiality goals. "While it seems improbable that neural networks would become great at cryptanalysis, they may be quit effective in making sense of metadata and in traffic analysis.”  Image Credit: Asif Islam / Shutterstock ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anthony Spadafora Anthony currently resides in South Korea where he teaches and experiences Korean technological advances first hand.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Root for the Google Pixel, Pixel XL is now available via SuperSU 2.78 SR2 By John Hoff - October 31, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We told you guys that legendary developer Chainfire had gained systemless root access to Google’s spanking new handsets – the Google Pixel and Pixel XL – and was on the brink of making this root method available to the public. Now the day has arrived and SuperSU 2.78 SR2 is available for all of those who want to gain root access to their Pixel phones. SuperSU is probably the most popular root access manager used on Android these days – you can’t discuss root access and not talk about SuperSU. Version 2.78 SR2 is the one that works on Google’s Pixel phones, and it goes via the “systemless” route – which means that it enables su access without touching anything in the system partition and allowing for dm-verity to be toggled. A very strong reminder – you only need Chainfire’s “boot-to-root.img” file for this process, which makes it a whole lot easier, but somewhat dangerous as well. Rooters are used to doing the “fastboot flash” command when gaining root. WARNING: do not use the fastboot flash command. You only need this command: fastboot boot boot-to-root.img. After a few boots and reboots, you should get back to your home screen with full root access. You can check out the XDA source link below for the downloadable files and the complete instructions on how to do this process and for details on what’s new. Happy rooting, Pixel owners.

Following impressive quarterly earnings calls, Google reporting group revenues of $22.5 billion up 23% in constant revenues and AWS $3.2 billion, up from just over $2 billion for the same period in 2015, the fight for the share of the public cloud segment is starting to get interesting. While AWS stole a march on the segment by virtue of being first to offer a mass market offering, Google Cloud has not been shy in making its intentions public. Although the AWS will not be sweating too much for the moment, the omens are slightly worrying for the public cloud incumbent. Yes, 2016 is likely to be year AWS will breach the $10 billion ceiling, and yes it is far ahead in the market share rankings, however if there is one business which could mount a serious challenge to this dominance, it is Google. AWS could be its own worst enemy in a way. The normalization of cloud computing has created more competitors, and there isn’t an organization worldwide which has done more in this quest that AWS. The team are also happy to see cloud computing be commoditized as it believes there is more than enough business for everyone to be successful, but if a pricing war is on the horizon, Google’s current momentum could be one of the defining factors. Google has deeper pockets than most in the technology industry, and has seemingly freed up some cash following its announcement to put the fibre business unit on hold. The team does not appear to be afraid to throw cash as a growing market, but it would appear the fibre unit was asking too much of the generous parent. One area which could make the difference is the growing interest in machine learning. Last month, the team announced a new Cloud division which would incorporate all cloud offerings from IaaS to enterprise solutions to its consumer artificial intelligence work. Including in this new unit is the machine learning proposition. Machine learning is the facet of AI which has captured the interest of the world in recent months, and there are few companies in the world who boast the same capabilities as Google. Following the Deepmind acquisition in 2014, Google arguably counts the finest set of machine learning engineers worldwide in its ranks. “We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing,” said CEO Sundar Pichai. “This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade from desktops to mobile devices.” “I would say other areas are hiring across sales, engineering, and marketing,” CFO Ruth Porat added. “And as we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and head count growth.” Google is not only targeting the public cloud segment, but seemingly everything else as well. Google assistant is in the AI game, Nest puts it in IoT, ‘Allo helps it in the messaging segment, autonomous cars have not hit two-million-mile mark of test driving, the open-source Project Accelerated Mobile Pages has celebrated its first birthday, content platforms such as YouTube and Google Play are growing double-digit quarter-on-quarter and Daydream sets its stall in virtual reality. Google dominates the internet advertising game, and its brand credibility could propel it to the same worldly position as IBM in the 80s, Microsoft in the 90s and Apple in the 00s. The team have also announced plans to expand to eight new cloud regions in 2017, from Mumbai to Singapore to São Paulo to Frankfurt, with more to come. The AWS exec team may have cause to be concerned. So how has AWS reacted to the growing beast that is Google. “I didn’t listen to the Google call, but you’ll have to fill me in on that later,” said CFO Brian Olsavsky. “The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is, price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. “We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only did we lower the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to.” Firstly, if the CFO of Amazon does not know what was said on the earnings call of a company which is more than a serious threat to its fastest growing division, what is this gentleman up to?  Secondly, AWS are seemingly happy to go into a price war, but considering the cash available to its most vocal competitor, it may not be wise to advertise this so loudly. AWS is still the leader in the public cloud market and this will not change in the immediate future. But a race to the bottom could be a dangerous route for the incumbent to head considering the amount of time Google could sustain a lower pricing point, the cash-cow it has available through tens of billions of dollars of advertising revenues and the vast portfolio of cloud value adds it has available to push up the price point. Google didn’t get its own way in the fibre market, but it already has a strong position in the public cloud market; there could be some serious problems caused. This is a major challenge to AWS’ leading position, and Microsoft Azure hasn’t even been discussed here. Diversification and parallel offerings have been critical factors in years gone by, which could be a worrying factor for AWS execs considering the expansive positions Google and Microsoft see themselves in.

A research paper filed with  Cornell University Library, details how Google used a trio of artificial neural networks to devise a system of AI-powered automated encryption and decryption. AI meets cyber security In the most basic terms Google started with two neural networks, which use a process called deep learning to filter data through a series of computational nodes like an artificial take on data processing carried out by the human brain, called Alice and Bob. The brace of neural networks was set up to have Alice send encrypted messages to Bob who has the job of decrypting them while a third neural net called Eve tried to eavesdrop on the chatter between Alice and Bob. “A system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob,” Google researchers Martín Abadi and David Andersen explained in the paper. “We do not prescribe specific cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks; instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially. We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet confidentiality goals.” Both Alice and Bob started off with a pre-assigned encryption key but had to create their own algorithms from it. Alice then took plain text which she had to turn into a cipher and send to Bob in the form of a binary 16 bit long message. Bob who would then try and figure out the cipher based on the encryption key to convert the message back into its original plain text. Alice and Bob In the early stages Alice and Bob were poor at sending secured messages to each other, but as they learnt through practice they created a stronger encryption and decryption strategy. After 15,000 communications, Bob could successfully decrypt the cipher text messages sent by Alice into understandable plain text, while Eve could only work out eight out of the 16 bits of the messages. Given the bits were formed of either a 0 or a 1, the 50 percent success rate of Eve was essentially like guessing heads or tails in a coin toss. However, this process of encryption is rather basic compared to the sophisticated ciphers used by modern human cryptography, so Google’s research is more of a proof-of-concept rather than any indication that the future of cyber security and encrypted communications will be reliant on AIs. The researchers were also not able to work out the encryption Alice and Bob eventually come up with, meaning that using such a system in the real-world would throw up challenges of being able to guarantee the strength and type of encryption being used. Furthermore, neural networks take a lot of computational power and often a lengthy process of self-training before they can deliver desirable results, which also make the application of such a system in real-world cyber security currently impractical. But the research serves as evidence on how far Google is coming with its Ai research, having already created a system that can learn to mimic human speech rather than have the stilted sounds of Apple Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. And Google is already putting some of its AI tech into action with the Google Assistant in the search giant’s Pixel smartphones serving as a practical example of AI-powered software in action.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas October 31, 2016 10:28 GMT Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump addresses a campaign rally at the Jefferson County Fairgrounds 29 October, 2016 in Golden, ColoradoChip Somodevilla/Getty Images Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump slammed Google, Twitter and Facebook on Sunday (30 October), alleging that the companies are "burying" coverage of the FBI's re-opened investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. The Republican presidential candidate, who has long accused the mainstream media of rigging the upcoming elections in favour of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's by spreading "outright lies", took to Twitter to accuse the tech giants of being "dishonest media". "Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI investigation of Clinton," Trump tweeted. "Very dishonest media!" Although Trump does not mention the specifics of how the companies are allegedly burying the news or evidence to support his claims, he seems to be referring to Facebook and Twitter's 'trending' topics and Google's top stories. On Friday, news broke that the FBI was reopening its investigation into Clinton's private emails after the agency discovered a trove of government-related emails on a laptop that longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin used with her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, that are "pertinent to the investigation". Discovered during an unrelated sexting investigation, the new emails prompted a decision to reopen the probe into the use of Clinton's private email server during her tenure as secretary of state just 11 days before Election Day. On Sunday, CNN host Brian Stelter and multiple media outlets pointed out that news of the FBI's renewed investigation was a trending topic on Twitter and the top story on Google News. Earlier this year, Facebook denied allegations that editors running Facebook's trending news section were biased against conservative news outlets and stories. To improve its feature, the social media giant decided to rely on "a more algorithmically driven process" to determine what stories make it to the Trending box based on popularity and importance. After fake news stories and conspiracy theories were erroneously being promoted by Facebook's Trending algorithm, the company got a "review team" to work on the feature, but exercise less editorial oversight than the previous news editors. In response to Mashable's request for comment, a Facebook spokesperson also pointed the publication to the CNN tweet (embedded above). Social media users were also quick to point out that Google, Facebook and Twitter are not "media companies". This is not the first time Trump has claimed that Google has been suppressing negative news about Hillary Clinton during the campaign season. During the summer, a conspiracy theory appeared in a viral video from online outlet SourceFed that claimed to show evidence that Google was actively altering search recommendations to hide negative coverage of Hillary Clinton. The theory was quickly debunked by news outlets as well as Google who pointed out that the search engine's 'autocomplete algorithm' filters out inaccurate information. "Our autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person's name," a company spokeswoman told CNN at the time. "Google autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how autocomplete works." Trump supported the unsubstantiated theory during a rally in Wisconsin in September saying:"The Google poll had us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton. How about that?" Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!— Donald J.

What Tech Companies Can Do To Practice Inclusive Recruiting by Gina-Marie Cheeseman on Monday, Oct 31st, 2016 Technology Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) A peek into Facebook HQ further reveals the tech firm’s homogenous workforce. There is a serious lack of diversity among tech companies. While many have made efforts to increase their diversity numbers, the results are lackluster at best. LinkedIn recently released its 2016 diversity report. Women make up 42 percent of the company’s workforce, while men are 58 percent. White people are 54 percent of the workforce, Asian 36 percent, Latino 5 percent, and African American a dismal 3 percent. LinkedIn included global statistics for the tech industry in its report, and it showed the company has made progress. Globally, men make up 80 percent of the tech industry workforce. LinkedIn also included statistics for the non-tech workforce, which is 52 percent female and 48 percent male. So, clearly the tech industry is behind the non-tech workforce when it comes to diversity and inclusion.  “We will continue to strive to do better,” Pat Wadors, LinkedIn SVP for global talent organization, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. Data from other tech companies makes it clear the entire tech industry needs to do better when it comes to diversity. Take Facebook and Google. Facebook’s workforce, as of July 2016, is 27 percent women, 3 percent African-American, and 3 percent Latino. Its senior leadership hires in the U.S. over the last 12 months were 9 percent African-American, 5 percent Hispanic and 29 percent female. Google’s workforce consists of 31 percent women and 69 percent men. Its employees are also 59 percent white, with Latinos and African-Americans making up 2 and 3 percent, respectively. Data on the diversity of tech companies compiled by Pixel Envy shows similar results to the diversity reports by LinkedIn, Facebook and Google. So, what can companies do to improve? They can start by focusing on two things that help companies build more inclusive organizations, Tyi McCray, a partner at Paradigm, told TriplePundit. She said companies must look not only at their hiring processes, but also at how they attract candidates. To increase diversity, a company must first increase transparency, McCray explained. As Hudson, which helps companies find talent, put it: Companies need to do an “honest, accurate and transparent assessment” of their diversity shortcomings. In other words, companies must conduct self-assessments. McCray believes that a self-assessment should always be the first step. In the self assessment, a company should “reflect on what their current processes look like, and how these process might be limiting or advancing inclusion,” she added. McCray cites examples about how a company can conduct a self-assessment. They “should consider how they write job descriptions, review resumes, structure interviews, write interview feedback, and discuss candidates,” she told us. The “entire hiring process is a prime setting for unconscious bias.” Companies that do not design a “fair and objective process” will not be able to increase diversity and “miss out on the best candidates,” McCray explained. Companies can also use “an outside firm” to conduct a “thorough assessment of the culture of the organization including discrimination in pay and hiring practices,” author Bonnie Marcus suggested last year in Forbes. What can companies do beyond conducting self assessments? The website Hire More Women in Tech lists steps companies can take to increase diversity, as does Marcus in her Forbes piece. One of those steps is finding ways to expand networks. Partnering with influential organizations and companies is one way to do better networking. Hudson lists examples of potential partner organizations, including historically black colleges, minority business associations and women’s professional networks. Other steps include: Offer mandatory training for every employee in unconscious bias. Pinterest includes training in unconscious bias in their diversity plain. Develop career paths for employees that enable them to see how they can advance. Develop coaching and training programs for women and minorities on relational skills. Create mentor programs to help women and minorities both understand the culture and politics of their organization. Track the gender of applicants, not just the hires. Invest in existing women and minority tech communities. Invest in the future by sponsoring events and underwriting scholarships, paying fellows or interns in the communities a company is trying to reach, start a mentoring program, and underwrite trainings. Treat well the women and minorities who already work for you. McCray also suggested that firms take a look at their company websites. Career websites in tech “very often depict homogenous cultures, showing images of young (and often primarily white) men,” she explained. Women and minorities might look at those images and “conclude they don’t belong.” Companies need to “showcase the range of people in their organization,” she told us, and the company website is a “great place to promote inclusive policies.” In other words: Tech companies need to rethink the image they portray to women and minorities on their websites.

While both the Pixel and the Pixel XL come with a hefty price tag, they do sport some of the best specs found on a smartphone, with the "best smartphone camera" to boot, alongside being able to offer the best Android experience ever on a phone, since Google worked both on the hardware and the software, resulting in a healthy synergy of a software and hardware combo with intent and purpose. The phones run on Google's latest OS, Android 7.0 Nougat, which boasts additional features not available on other smartphones, including a system-wide Google Assistant functionality and a custom Android UI. Despite the shipping woes brought by overwhelming demand of the phones, those of you who have already gotten hold of the Pixel or the Pixel XL should read on if you want to know a few tips in order to get more out of your phone and even decrease battery consumption. Turn Off Keyboard Vibration Apart from slowing down key input, keyboard vibrations do take a swig out of your battery's juice each time, so it's wiser to just turn it off altogether since haptic feedback doesn't really feel like pressing a button, to nobody's surprise. Go to Settings, then tap Languages & Input, then tap Virtual keyboard, then tap Google keyboard, then tap Preferences and toggle the "vibrate on keypress" off. While you're there, you can go ahead and turn off keyboard sounds too. Turn On Night Light Mode It's been proven that the smartphone screens actually hamper our ability to go into a deep slumber, and the night light feature tries to remedy that by laying over a warmer hue during evenings to avoid eye strain. Tap Settings, then display and then turn on night light. Turn On The Battery Percentage Indicator If you're like most people who are extremely meticulous about keeping track of your phone's battery life, then you can head on over to the notifications panel to turn the battery indicator on. Hold the system icon for a few seconds and then release. A hidden System UI tuner will appear at the bottom of the settings menu. Open it, then tap Status bar and choose to show the battery percentage level. Change How Big UI Elements Are There's a new option to set the size of how big certain user interface elements should appear. You can select this one by going over to Settings and then hitting display. In it you'll find a slider that increases or decreases screen elements to your liking. Split-Screen Multitasking Tap and hold the "recents" button in order to access the multitasking screen. From there you can choose another app that would run on the second half of the display area. Access One-Handed Mode If you're lugging another piece of item on your free hand and you have no choice but to type with just one hand, you can press and hold the "return" button while the keyboard is open.

The Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL have been rooted. That means that custom ROMs can be employed on the two models. Chainfire developed the tool to root the new Google handsets. He points out that "the images for the Pixels need to be 'fastboot boot'ed, not flashed. After a few minutes (have patience) and a couple of (automatic) reboots, Android should boot fully rooted." Rooting the phone in the US means dealing with a Verizon bootloader that is not unlockable. But a tool called the dePixel8 will handle that task, allowing you to root either Pixel model. One important note. The dePixel8 will stop working once the November security update is disseminated. This means that if you want to unlock the bootloader on your Pixel or Pixel XL handset, you better do the deed before the security update is pushed out. And yes, the tool will work with other Pixel models without an unlockable bootloader such as the units sold overseas by EE. If you've never rooted your phone before, be careful. One slip up and you now own an expensive brick. That is why even those who have rooted their phone before know to keep some stock firmware lying around just in case a life saver is needed. Flashing back to stock will get you out of most trouble. Also, keep in mind that you will lose your warranty just for unlocking the bootloader, and miss out on updates sent while your phone is rooted. If still interested in proceeding, click on the sourcelinks. All of the developers are offering their hard work for free, so you might want to send a donation. Money sent for the dePixel8 will go to support the Make-A-Wish Foundation.         LATEST STORIES (4) Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Iran Urges Unity Among Muslim Nations Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army troops continued to hit the terrorist groups' defense lines and gatherings and seized back new regions in Western Ghouta, tightening the siege of the militant-held town of Khan al-Sheih.

Tuesday, November 15, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Lite Stories  Google’s Halloween Doodle features fun, interactive browser game October 31, 2016, Monday Russell Ting A screenshot of Google’s Halloween 2016 Doodle, which features an interactive game with simple controls and gameplay. KUCHING: Google has once again worked its magic to create a fun distraction for all ages in the form of an interactive Doodle this Halloween. Clicking the logo on Google’s homepage will take users on an adventure featuring a black cat named Momo on a mission to rescue her school of magic. By matching corresponding symbols using a mouse, users will be able to vanquish the scores of enemy ghosts that float ever closer to Momo. Letting too many ghosts touch Momo will also result in a Game Over. The simplistic gameplay and premise makes for a fun distraction, and the game has five levels to clear. Users will also receive a score depending on their performance. According to Google, the inspiration for this year’s cat spell-casting game came from a real-life black cat named Momo that belongs to Doodler Juliana Chen. “It seemed like a good opportunity for a cat hero, since the winner of last year’s Candy Cup Doodle was Yellow Witch and her black cat. “Doodling for a whole Doodle game was very exciting for us. We had so many ideas for elaborate symbols to draw, like a witch’s hat that would appear on the character’s head after it was drawn! In the end we decided that for a short game against the clock, simple was better,” Google said on its Doodle page. Give the game a try this Halloween by clicking here.

GET IN TOUCH       Ghana News Ghana News, Ghana Politics, Ghana Sports, Ghana Business           Home Business Politics Elections Sport Showbiz Odd But True Opinion Relationship Lifestyle Infographics Photo Gallery TV Trump attacks Facebook, Google, Twitter as ‘dishonest’ media Monday 31st October , 2016 9:15 am Donald Trump Donald Trump lashed out at Facebook, Google and Twitter over the weekend, claiming they were “burying” negative news about Hillary Clinton. Trump took to Twitter on Sunday morning to let everyone know he was mad about something. Two weeks ago, he yelled about Saturday Night Live‘s “hit job” — now it’s a vague proclamation that lumps Facebook, Google and Twitter under the umbrella of “dishonest media.” According to Trump, the tech companies are guilty of suppressing news relating to the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. He doesn’t get into specifics, so it’s not entirely clear what he believes has been buried, or how. A quick glance at Google News shows that the investigation — reignited on Friday when FBI director James Comey pointed to newly unearthed emails — is the top result as of 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday morning. IMAGE: GOOGLE Twitter doesn’t surface information in quite the same way as Google, but both #Election2016 and the Clinton probe are at the top of the site’s “Featured Tweets” section as of Sunday morning. IMAGE: TWITTER Facebook’s own “What’s Trending” section may or may not include mention of the email probe; it’s a difficult thing to track since the content of that section is tied to the current user’s account. Reached for comment, a Facebook spokesperson pointed Mashable toward the below CNNtweet, in which correspondent Brian Stelter addressed the Trump tweet and tried to deduce its meaning on Reliable Sources. Google News doesn’t change rankings of stories to influence user opinion, a source at Google told Mashable, nor does it tweak rankings related to political candidates. Mashable also reached out to Twitter for comment, but the company did not respond. The same cannot be said of the Twitter community at large. Trump’s tweet quickly garnered a slew of responses from users who were too happy to point out that the targets of the presidential hopeful’s ire are not, in fact, “media” companies (something Facebook stressed as recently as five days ago).   Facebook Ghana News Marian Efe Ansah Tagged with: Facebook Ghana News More on citifmonline.com Flippy Campus launches online marketplace for tertiary students November 14, 2016 Facebook to do more tackling fake news November 14, 2016 Facebook wants to make you secure November 13, 2016 Facebook bug ‘kills’ users in ‘terrible error’ November 12, 2016 Spotify patches ‘data gobbling’ glitch November 11, 2016 13 year old honoured internationally for feats in tech space November 11, 2016 General News Mahama opens Kwame Nkrumah Interchange project [Photos] November 14, 2016 Burkinabe arrested for gruesome murder of school principal November 14, 2016 UK threatens to deny visas over election violence in Ghana November 14, 2016 We may deny visas over election violence – US warns Ghana November 14, 2016 Nana Addo doesn’t understand realities of governance – Mahama November 14, 2016 Advertisement Recent Posts Mahama opens Kwame Nkrumah Interchange project [Photos] Eyewitness News, Monday, November 14th, 2016 10th Further and Higher Education Conference opens in Accra [Photos] Bolgatanga SHS wins 2016 NHIS Quiz competition There’s no error with NPP logo on ballot – EC Burkinabe arrested for gruesome murder of school principal UK threatens to deny visas over election violence in Ghana We may deny visas over election violence – US warns Ghana Flippy Campus launches online marketplace for tertiary students Road Safety Management Services deploys tow trucks at Circle interchange Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2016 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

NB: This is a guest viewpoint from Nicholas Ward, CEO of Koddi. We’re seeing this new Deals placement for certain hotel queries on Google, now placed above the top ad slot. Clicking it brings you into the map results with the “Nearby Deal” preselected. From our observations, it appears that the Deals are nearby properties with similar ratings and amenities. The Nearby Deal refreshes after changing the Check in and Check out date. In the example shown here, the Holiday Inn Express Philadelphia NE – Langhorne is currently the top result for variations of the query “langhorne, pa hotels”, indicating that Google is using the same or similar signals to rank properties and to select which hotels to include in this experience. Again, to be clear: This is a test. So only some Google users will see it on some searches. The “Nearby Deal” doesn’t appear to need to be a Deal in the normal Google sense of being lower priced than normal. In the example below, the Koloa Landing Resort doesn’t appear to be at a rate any better than normal, but it is priced better than the Sheraton Kauai, is relevant as a high ranking hotel, and well rated. It is being suggested as an alternate to the Sheraton Kauai. So far we have been unable to replicate this experience on mobile devices. Implications for properties and advertisers Since this experience is showing on hotel-focused queries, there is an important cross sell implication to consider. Google has long shown a “People also searched for…” section at the bottom of the Knowledge Panel with links to different properties, but this Nearby Deal experience encourages a direct comparison for users when they may be fairly deep in the booking process. The experience does provide a value to users, which should help advertisers in the long run. A well informed user may convert higher since they are prequalifying further before clicking to the site. It may become more important in the future for advertisers to understand which properties are subject to these types of experiences, and which properties are recommended as Nearby Deals to maximize traffic volume. Google continues to do a variety of experiments, such as how we’re seeing the Hotel Ads unit outside of the Knowledge Panel globally tested. Across domains for hotel specific searches, Google is also testing a new format that shifts the Hotel Ads unit from its usual home in the knowledge panel to the middle of the screen, sometimes even giving it preference over Text Ads: See details on that, here. Overall though the above example are only experiments — but they are reminders that the state of play for hotel metasearch is in flux. NB: This is a guest viewpoint from Nicholas Ward, CEO of Koddi, a digital marketing agency specializing in meta search advertising for travel brands. A version of this post first appeared on the Koddi blog a month ago and has been shared here because the Google experiment continues and isn’t a one-off.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Special Nodes Special Nodes is the byline under which Tnooz publishes articles by guest authors from around the industry.   Tags Google google ads hotels koddi Comments Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Reply 2 weeks ago   Dorian Harris @nicholas (sorry, there was no direct ‘reply’ option to your comment) You and Sean seem to be suggesting that Google is free to decide what is or isn’t a deal. I’m not convinced that’s the case and I maintain that any attempt by Google to lure customers to a particular property on the basis of its marketing language will be frowned upon, or even curtailed, by advertising authorities. In any case, how would Google decide what’s a deal when Google isn’t even the merchant? For all Google knows, its source of hotel prices is expensive and, whilst the Hilton has gone down from $300 to $150 on Google, and is now lower than the price of the Sheraton on Google, it has gone down to $100 on most other distribution channels. Suddenly the $150 Hilton rate on Google is actually a particularly bad deal. Guidelines vary from country to country, of course, but ‘deals’ or any strong price-signalling language, is regulated everywhere I’ve seen, even in the US. Reply 3 weeks ago   Dorian Harris “Deals” is a bit misleading, isn’t it? I’m not sure that would get past the advertising authorities. Reply 3 weeks ago   Sean O'Neill Hi Dorian, Thanks for the comment. Not sure about the authorities, but Google is usually quite circumspect about such matters. This continues to be a test. Since the summer, in real live search results in the US and rolling out worldwide, Google’s algorithms now apply a “Deal” label to spotlight hotel rates that are lower than usual compared to the past or when there are discounts to the normal rate for those dates. That is a kind of consistent, non-commercially influenced rule that would presumably pass muster with authorities. Google sees that hotels labeled as “deals” receive about twice as many bookings as other hotels through its platform, and that the deals are automatically identified by the search engine’s algorithms when it sees a sharp drop in a rate. Reply 3 weeks ago   Dorian Harris Hi Sean, Thank you for your reply. I realise the entire hotel industry plays it fast-and-loose with the term ‘deal’, but I’m not convinced Google will get away with it in exactly the same way. Is it really a deal when everyone is selling the room at exactly the same price? Reply 3 weeks ago   Nicholas Ward Hi Dorian, I think it’s important to note that there are a couple of layers that come into play with the deal messaging. The first is whether the rate appears to be a good deal in market, and the second is whether the offer appears to be a good deal in comparison to similar offers. From what we’ve seen there are pretty good controls around this, though we do rarely find an errant experience. To Google’s credit, they respond quickly to this kind of feedback. Agreed that isn’t crystal clear but I don’t find anything disingenuous with the experience… Do you see a better way to clarify this for users? 3 weeks ago   chak Expectation that the prices displayed will really be lesser compared to all available rates is unrealistic. In addition a deal is not necessarily on price alone . It can be on other parameters like location , amenities , stars . Google should not be held responsible for ensuring a “deal”. On a side note there are plenty of instances where “deal” is flaunted ex amazon for an item where as if you search there will be other places with a lesser price. 3 weeks ago   ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2bfe3f0&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2bfe3f0&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=45&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a2bfe3f0' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=aa0a2c91&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=aa0a2c91&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=47&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=aa0a2c91' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a365b2b5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a365b2b5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=51&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a365b2b5' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9b3a1d3&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9b3a1d3&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=60&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a9b3a1d3' border='0' alt='' /></a>   <a href='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a3e1f225&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=56&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a3e1f225' border='0' alt='' /></a>   Return to the top of page Articles Overview Devices Distribution Marketing Social Startups Systems Travel sectors Regions About Overview Our History Contact People Partners Advertise Overview Media pack Events Overview Calendar Thack Tnooz live Webinars   All rights reserved © 2016 tnooz Privacy Copyright Disclaimer Ethics statement Site Map   Design and development by Momentum Design Lab   Latest News LeisureLink COO to drive NextPax US, Keller confirmed at Priceline.com, and more...

Nexus 6P Plagued by Battery Failure Issues After Android 7.0 Nougat Update GO The phone can only be turned back on using a charger Oct 31, 2016 06:59 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  The Nexus 6P was among the first smartphones to receive Google's Android 7.0 Nougat update, and for the most part, everyone was happy with what they've got on their phones. There were some issues with the initial rollout as some Nexus 6P experienced some problems with the battery after updating to Android 7.0 Nougat, but they were quickly fixed by Google. After reports of Nexus 6P battery draining too fast, Google pushed another Android 7.0 Nougat update, which seems to have introduced another issue that affects the same piece of hardware inside the phone: the battery. According to many Reddit users, the Nexus 6P randomly shuts itself down and can't be turned back on unless using a charger to “reset” it. The issue is easy to replicate since you only need to take a few pictures (as the video below shows) for the Nexus 6P to inexplicably shut itself down. Play Video Even holding the power button pressed for a few seconds won't wake up the phone. The only workaround that some Nexus 6P owners found in order to turn the phone back on is to insert the charger cable into the USB Type-C port and wait for the battery icon to show up on the display. After that, the Power button should once again allow you to turn the Nexus 6P back on. Some Nexus 6P owners suggest that, in order for this issue to disappear completely, a complete reset of all app permissions is necessary. It's also worth mentioning that Nexus 6P owners who managed to replicate the problem claim a factory reset does not remove it. Other claim the problem affects the Nexus 6 as well, especially when loading energy hungry apps. While it's clear that this is a software issue, it doesn't seem to affect all Nexus 6P devices yet, so it's not a widespread problem. Even so, many Nexus 6P owners have filed surveys on Google's support website, so the search giant is probably already aware of these issues. It will take some time though to roll out another software fix.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (6 Images) #Nexus 6P#Android 7.0 update#Nexus 6P issues#Nexus 6P battery#battery issues subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Nexus 6P (6 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Huawei Turned Down Chance to Manufacture Pixel Phones - Report Android 7.0 Nougat OTA for Nexus 6P Starts Rolling Out Nexus Devices to Connect Automatically Using Google’s Wi-Fi Assistant Android 7.0 Nougat to Receive Quarterly Maintenance Updates OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2 Mozilla Firefox 50.0 Now Available for Download, Brings Built-in Emoji on Linux 6 photos    Nexus 6P new android apps Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   HTC Bolt Goes Official at Sprint: 5.5-Inch QHD Display, 16MP Camera, Nougat more on: HTC Bolt i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

But as web technologies advanced, some doodles turned into interactive content, a.k.a. games. This Halloween, Google deigned to inject some cuteness into the usually scary but sometimes fun celebration, by making a game that tasked a wizard cat into vanquishing ghastly foes. All by waving its wand, which means swiping with your mouse or, better yet, with your fingers on a screen. The mechanics of the game is pretty simple. Each ghost that advances towards the wizard cat in the center of the screen has one or more symbols on its head. To exorcise the ghost, you must draw the symbols as fast as you can before they reach you. Sounds simple? Try “casting” a 7 to 8 symbol-spell on a mini-boss while 4 other minions try to make their way towards you. Google explains in a post the inspiration and design process for the game, and why they opted to turn the tables around and make the black cat the hero of the day. Various ideas were proposed for the gameplay, involving more sophisticated rules but equally sophisticated graphics. In the end, however, simplicity and a race against time made for a better and more addictive winning formula. To some extent, the small “postmortem” gives a glimpse into the process of game development, which budding game designers and developers might want to munch on. Considering the way the game is played, it is best experienced on a device with a touch screen. On mobile, the Doodle is guaranteed to work with Chrome, while Firefox will also work on tablets. Even better if you happen to have a stylus or Apple Pencil, as you would then really feel like a wizard.

Google is trying aggressively to make Google Allo to be at the top of the group of instant messaging apps. Since its inception, with an aim to make the app more popular, Google has been rolling out a continuous series of updates. Within that series of updates, there is a new one. Google has unveiled that its chat will have new themes, and according to leaks and rumours they will be released soon. Recent leaked images show us how the new chat themes will look like, and they do feel great. The update will have the new split screen and Quick Reply features, though in the changelog of the latest update the chat theme features are yet not mentioned. As of now, only the ‘Monochrome’ theme is present in the General Settings of the latest update of Google Allo. Even the default theme is similar to it, so there is not much of a difference. 9to5Google’s Stephen Hall leaked images of a few themes which might be launched soon. The themes include Moon, Sorbet and Clouds, which are quite similar to the ones we find in WhatsApp and Viber. Hall also wrote on Twitter, “So it seems monochrome in Allo 2 doesn’t serve many purposes yet, but you’re going to want to have that option when chat themes are added.” With the launch of new features, Google Allo is aiming for the top spot, which is still a far cry from other platforms like Snapchat. It is important that it works more on its user engagement, as it does not get benefits which YouTube, Gmail and Chrome get, being part of core Google Mobile Services (GMS) component for OEMs using the Android OS. Google Allo 2.0: 9to5Google’s Stephen Hall leaked images of a few themes which might be launched soon. The themes include Moon, Sorbet and Clouds, which are quite similar to the ones we find in WhatsApp and Viber. Justin Uberti, the technical lead for Duo and the co-lead of Allo, wrote on Twitter about the other new updates, which include, “Allo 2.0 relnotes (Android): App shortcuts, Landscape, N quick reply, N multi-window, GIF keyboard, a11y mode and Incognito key alerts.

News Reviews Tech Tips Galleries Buying Guides Videos Talking Points SEARCH HOT GADGETS Samsung Galaxy Note 7 iPhone 7 Google Pixel Moto Z Play Xiaomi Mi Mix OnePlus 3T ZenFone 3 Max Nokia D1C is a phone not a tablet, images leak online Samsung to launch AI digital assistant service for Galaxy S8 Microsoft stops selling Windows 7, Windows 8 BlackBerry launches DTEK50, DTEK60 Android phones in India Home > Technology > Google tries new approach with voice on Pixel phone Reuters Last Updated: OCT 31, 2016 Email Author About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google's Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft Corp's Cortana. Also Read: Google Pixel XL review: The best Android phone. Period. "We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information," Rakowski said in an interview. Leaf from Apple's BookThe fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button." The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words "OK Google." By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google "doesn't have to do negotiations with another handset maker - they can make it as tight as they want," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." Samsung going it alone?Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. Also Read: Best phones to buy in October: This Diwali, Pixel & iPhone 7 are absolute best buys "If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator," said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. "They will be relegated to just pushing hardware." Google is coy about its plans. "Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible," Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company's earnings call on Thursday. Also Read: Pixel is good beginning, but Google's best phone will come in 2017 "The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience," he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie," he said. "I approach this the same way."

افكار و احلام A journal at al-Qâhira fî Amrîkâ 10.31.16 Gmail Image Proxy and Spaces in Image URLs Posted in Software, Your Daily QA at 2:24 am by Smokey A couple of years ago, Google decided that it was going to insert its own image proxy between your Gmail messages and any remote images referenced therein. Before this, if an email included an image that was not sent along with the email (an external or remote image), when you read the email, your web browser saw the image reference in the message and loaded the image directly from the source. Now, however, Google rewrites the email message to refer to the image via Gmail’s image proxy, which loads and caches the image from the original location, and when you read the email, your web browser loads the image from Gmail’s image proxy rather than the original source. There are a number of benefits to this approach, but there are also drawbacks—namely, new bugs. Periodically, I receive an email to my Gmail account from Zacks, the large investment research firm, which contains a remote image that has spaces in its filename, e.g. “motm cash sidelines image_624.png” in Sunday’s email. Not only are there spaces in the image filename, but these spaces aren’t escaped or encoded when the image URL is inserted into the HTML content of the email: <img style="width: 624px; height: 269px; float: left; margin: 0px 8px 0px 0px;" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/thumbnail/motm cash sidelines image_624.png" alt=""/>1 It’s certainly not best-practices to include spaces in any part of a URL, nor to include such URL in HTML with the spaces unescaped/unencoded, but as we have long-since left behind the world of strict and restrictive DOS and UNIX filename conventions, it is not unexpected these days to see humane filenames and file paths on the web (and, anyway, every reasonable web browser and email client knows how to handle such cases properly). This is what Gmail, using its image proxy to load the external image, displays: This is what Mac OS X Mail displays when viewing the same email: Finally, this is what a web browser (Safari, in this case, though any modern browser should display similarly) displays when viewing the HTML content of the same email: Both Mail and Safari know how to handle image URLs with (unescaped) spaces in them, and they do so correctly. Gmail, and its image proxy, fail. The end result of the Gmail image proxy’s involvement in my email is that I have to extract the (rewritten) image URL from the message, strip off the part referring to the image proxy, and then fix the proxy’s broken encoding of the spaces in the original URL order to have an image URL I can then feed back to my browser and have it load the image (in another tab). Then I have the privilege of switching back and forth between the email text and the image the text is discussing. It’s a pain, but manageable, for one image. If there are several images in the email, repeating the process each time becomes quite annoying. Back to investigating the problem—this is the URL for the “missing” image in Gmail: https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/k0FVMVoNhpmHkkXhL6u7S4wzeMzBpLic1ugVLVVM4u-oIK79_Yb7WdjqITdHi0swAcPIGtpPGAK3B_MzoSvG32IRc2E6my-AqwWfDUPCvKezzfDRKGY-Ki9R3JORGPAhydwzYdLH_uxX7lKB2VCT93w=s0-d-e1-ft#https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/thumbnail/motm+cash+sidelines+image_624.png (Google’s systems, e.g., Blogger/Blogspot, tend to use the strange, non-standard practice of escaping/encoding spaces in URLs with the plus sign, even though they percent-encode everything else.) Recall that the filename of the image on the Zacks server is “motm cash sidelines image_624.png” but that the filename shown in the URL in Gmail is “motm+cash+sidelines+image_624.png”, and then evidence of the problem becomes apparent. If the Gmail image proxy tried to request “motm+cash+sidelines+image_624.png” from the Zacks web server, of course that image is not going to be found! Without knowing more details about how the entire process of scanning an email for external image references, fetching and storing (caching) them via the image proxy, and the rewriting the original email’s image reference to point to the image proxy instead, it’s difficult to tell exactly where the problem lies. For instance, if the part of the image proxy that does the fetching of the external image encodes the URL using Google’s “standard” encode-spaces-with-plus-signs method and tries to fetch that, it won’t find the image. If the fetching part properly percent-escapes/encodes the URL before fetching but stores the image on the proxy server either with its original filename or as the percent-encoded version (which would be “motm%20cash%20sidelines%20image_624.png” for those keeping track), but the rewriting part uses the plus sign-encoding when rewriting the reference in the mail message, things will be broken. (Though it seems ridiculous to have one subsystem do thing one way and another subsystem do the same thing another way, it’s probably not uncommon in large, complex software—I’ve seen things like that before—and may only fail in edge or corner cases that the developer or team might not consider.) Or, if for some reason the image proxy assembles the entire URL that is later found in the Gmail message and then encodes it (using Google’s “standard” encode-spaces-with-plus-signs method) when inserting it back into the email, and then only tries to fetch the image once I, or someone else getting the same Zacks newsletter asks Gmail to load images (or has automatic image loading turned on), it’s going to fail if it doesn’t first change the plus signs back to spaces (or percent-encoded spaces). It’s hard to say exactly where the bug might be, but make no mistake, it’s a bug; it’s Google’s bug (and it is no doubt caused in part by Google’s use of a non-standard encoding mechanism—spaces escaped with plus signs—in their web software).          1 The content of the email itself is actually sent encoded as Quoted-Printable, to protect it from such gremlins as 7-bit mail servers, but that’s not relevant to this bug and so I have decoded the Quoted-Printable here to make the HTML snippet more readily understandable. ↩︎ Permalink 9 Comments » Stephan Sokolow said, 10.31.16 at 3:27 am Actually, using pluses like that IS a standard… it’s just the wrong standard for this application. (You encode to pluses for application/x-www-form-urlencoded) Python 2.x has urllib.quote() and urllib.quote_plus(). PHP has rawurlencode() and urlencode(). (Again, with the latter encoding spaces as pluses) Java’s java.net.URLEncoder docs say that “The space character ” ” is converted into a plus sign “+”.” and you’re supposed to use java.net.URI for this sort of thing. etc. etc. etc. (In fact, given that Google uses Java in a lot of their projects and GMail is apparently one of them, I suspect that exact class may be the source of your problem.) Smokey said, 10.31.16 at 4:56 am Stephan: Thanks for the pointer about application/x-www-form-urlencoded; I didn’t realize it used plus-encoding of spaces. (I also haven’t thought about application/x-www-form-urlencoded form submissions in…two decades?) Knowing that, the PHP and Java function names make more sense in a world where “URL encoding” has otherwise become a more “generic” term disconnected from its roots in application/x-www-form-urlencoded. It’s still, as you say, the wrong encoding standard to be using in this case (and on Google’s image hosting attached to various services like Blogspot, which is where I first encountered this “strange” encoding in image filenames). Peter Kasting said, 10.31.16 at 5:06 am …and application/x-www-form-urlencoded methodology is what you’re supposed to use when encoding data to submit in the query portion of a URL. So for example http://foo.com/search?q=test+space is correct. In the URL cited here, the “query” param is instead passed in the URL’s fragment portion, but still encoded as if it’s in the query. There are various reasons one might do this (see e.g. how Google instant search uses such URLs to change the query params without reloading the page), but it seems like the wrong thing to do to me. In any case, though, this behavior is not completely randomly designed by Google; it looks more like a case of “function to encode for a query was used on data put into a fragment” than “Google invents crazy nonstandard encoding method”. Smokey said, 10.31.16 at 2:23 pm Peter: Thanks for that point. I’d be more inclined to believe that Google was making an accidental error of using query string encoding on a fragment, however, if I hadn’t been familiar with the prior use of application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding on image filenames on Blogger/Blogspot (and later anything else that used Google image/file hosting: Google+, Google Docs, etc.). For example, https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--WwuAkcvbFk/WBFDcqk2fqI/AAAAAAAAc6k/a4i6qzMluxM_f5aY166Qh-RMMhp7HeMogCLcB/s1600/wilshire+monthly.png (from here), which doesn’t look at all like a query string or fragment or anything other than a “normal” URL for an image file. The image proxy seemed like an extension of this behavior, rather than an extension of form submission, and in that manner seemed like “Google invents crazy nonstandard encoding method” since…that’s not what you use for normal URLs That said, I care far less about being right about what errors or decisions are causing this bug—as I said, since I don’t know the internals of the image proxy, it’s really hard to do more than speculate, although the non-percent encoding of spaces seemed a huge red flag—and vastly more that people know about the bug so that it can get fixed (If anyone knows a place where I can submit an actual bug report, I will happily submit one on this issue, with all the for-the-blog explanation and speculation trimmed out.) Peter Kasting said, 10.31.16 at 10:36 pm I suggest posting a report on the Gmail forum at https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/gmail . While Gmail also has a built-in bug report tool, which you’re welcome to use, my experience in Chrome has been that that tool dumps to a database that we data-mine, whereas good individual reports on product forums will get called to our attention by the consumer relations folks. (Of course, if Gmail’s real bug tracker were public as Chrome’s is, you could submit there, and that’d be even better…) Smokey said, 10.31.16 at 11:31 pm Thanks, Peter; I’ll post on that forum (and copy/paste into the Gmail tool afterwards, for good measure). Stephan Sokolow said, 11.02.16 at 3:27 am If it helps, when reporting it, you might also want to point out that, these days, people are recommending using %20 everywhere. (The + encoding is essentially just a legacy quirk and the percent-encoding resolver used for other escaped characters in such a string will handle %20 just fine, so the recommendation is to phase it out via an “accept either, generate only %20” policy) Smokey said, 11.02.16 at 5:22 pm Stephan, is there any sort of reference/citation I could mention for that “%20 everywhere” recommendation—[proto-]standards doc or blog manifesto or something? Stephan Sokolow said, 11.03.16 at 1:31 am Unfortunately, it’s not an official thing yet. HTML 5, section 4.10.22.6 still specifies encoding spaces as + when submitting application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Rather, it’s one of those organic cases where developers have been doing and recommending it more and more (eg. this popular StackOverflow answer that ranks high in searches about the difference between + and %20), despite it running counter to the spec, because their experience tells them that +-related coder error is a much larger threat than developers going out of their way to break decoding of %20. (The HTML spec defines that part of the decoding algorithm as, in paraphrase, “convert + to space, then decode all percent escapes”) …and then they call it a legacy quirk because it predates HTML forms and percent encoding (Prototyped April 1993 [2], first RFC in 1994), the IMG tag (proposed February 1993), and even the earliest surviving documentation of HTML itself (“HTML Tags” by Berners-Lee in 1992), where it was already implemented for the isindex-based “search field in the browser chrome produces a plus-separated list of keywords” functionality.)

Revenue rose to US$22.5bil (RM94.54bil) from US$18.7bil (RM78.57bil) in the same period a year earlier.  Shares rose nearly 1% in after-market trades that followed the release of the stronger-than-expected earnings figures.  ”We had a great third quarter,” Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in the earnings release.  ”Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we’re excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets.”  The California Internet titan revamped its corporate structure more than a year ago, making Google’s Internet operations a division of Alphabet and putting units such as autonomous cars and internet service balloons in an “other bets” or “moonshots” category.  The self-driving car effort that was once part of the X lab at Google – devoted to bold, futuristic projects – has become a separate business unit at Alphabet. Little has been revealed of its plans for going to market.  The loss reported from Other Bets in the recently ended quarter came to US$865mil (RM3.63bil), compared with US$980mil (RM4.11bil) in the same period a year earlier.  ”As we reach for moonshots that have a big impact in the longer term, it is inevitable that some efforts will have more success than others,” Porat said.  ”We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.”   New hardware strategy  Under its new structure, Alphabet is seeking to expand beyond its role as a search engine that provides advertising linked to queries. It has grown revenue in mobile search but is moving to further diversify its revenue stream.  Earlier this month, Google took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching premium-priced, in-house designed Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess.  Google also revealed details about its new “home assistant” virtual reality headset and WiFi router system.  But getting more heavily into hardware would entail new costs in the current quarter, Porat cautioned.  ”We expect to spend more on marketing in the year-end quarter due to the new products,” she said.  The company recently put on hold its “Fiber” initiative, which aimed to deliver ultrahigh-speed residential broadband to a number of cities.  Kansas City in 2011 became the first city chosen by the group to test its Google Fiber internet network, promising transmission speeds of 100 times that of current networks.  Although Alphabet remains committed to Fiber, it put deployment on hold after the team made “important breakthroughs” with technologies seen as key to implementation of the super-fast internet service, Porat said.  ”We wanted to focus on the potential of these efforts before we reaccelerate deployment,” she said.  ”It was about ensuring that we can take advantage of those (breakthroughs) before again pushing forth.”  Alphabet also announced that its board has authorised spending as much as US$7bil (RM29.41bil) to repurchase outstanding shares of stock.  The company’s shares were up nearly 1% to US$825 (RM3,466) in after-market trades that followed the earnings figures release.  ”Alphabet’s latest quarterly results were very good once again,” Pivotal Research Group said in a note to investors.  ”Revenue growth trends seem pretty clear with Google reinforcing its co-hegemonic position alongside Facebook on an ongoing basis.” — AFP You May Be Interested Alibaba posts record Singles' Day sales Broadband in 2,000 more Thai villages by March Zuckerberg again rejects claims of Facebook impact on US election Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

For more than an hour as of approximately 11:50 p.m. Sunday, a Google search for the terms “pathological lying” was producing a picture of Mrs. Clinton. The picture appears as the illustration for what Google calls a special “featured snippet block” at the top of the page. The snippet quotes from, and includes a link to, the Wikipedia article for “pathological lying.” Part of what makes the result odd is that while Mrs. Clinton has been accused of dishonesty and dissembling for the entire quarter-century since she became a national political figure as first lady, the Wikipedia article itself doesn’t mention her or any specific cases of dishonesty by her.

By: AP | San Francisco | Published:October 31, 2016 10:41 am YouTube already has proven to be one of the best bets that Google has ever made since it bought the video site for .76 billion a decade ago. YouTube has emerged as a break-out star in Google’s cast of services as the online video site upstages cable television for a younger generation of viewers looking for amusement, news and music on their smartphones. The trend is contributing to an advertising shift away from traditional network television programming to the more eclectic and diversified mix of clips ranging from cute cat videos to sobering shots of street violence found on YouTube. As more advertising dollars flow to YouTube, it’s making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report, Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 per cent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 per cent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. All that money is providing Google with more financial firepower to buy the rights to stream cable networks’ shows on YouTube, too, something likely to reel in even more viewers. It also is helping to finance Alphabet’s investments in far-flung projects ranging from self-driving cars to internet-beaming balloons. That segment, known as “Other Bets,” lost $865 million during the July-September period, narrowing from a $980 million setback last year as Alphabet imposed more expense controls. SMART DEAL YouTube already has proven to be one of the best bets that Google has ever made since it bought the video site for $1.76 billion a decade ago. At that juncture, YouTube consisted mostly of crudely made videos shot by amateurs and clips pirated from movie and TV studios that were threatening to sue the site into oblivion. It had built a worldwide audience of about 72 million viewers when Google took control in November 2006. Since then, YouTube has evolved into a far more polished channel that has spawned unlikely stars such as “PewDiePie” (Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) while largely making peace with studios by creating an automated screening system that detects pirated content. YouTube says it has paid more than $2 billion to studios that have chosen to leave their material on the site and share in the ad revenue generated by their clips. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened YouTube to prime-time TV “for the mobile world” in a conference call that was streamed on YouTube. Meanwhile, YouTube’s audience has surpassed 1 billion, with 80 per cent of the viewers outside the US. YouTube also boasts that its site reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 34 years old _ the “millennial” generation _ than any cable network. That segment of YouTube’s audience is a major reason why more than half its video clips are watched on mobile devices. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened YouTube to prime-time TV “for the mobile world” in a conference call that was streamed on YouTube. He told analysts that YouTube “continues to shine” as more major advertisers promote their brands on the site. Alphabet doesn’t disclose how much money YouTube is making, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates YouTube’s annual revenue has now reached $10 billion and is increasing by as much as 40 per cent a year. The growth makes YouTube “one of the strongest assets fundamentally on the internet today,” Mahaney wrote in a research note. STILL LACKING Despite its progress, YouTube has been slow in realizing its full potential, leaving it vulnerable to new challengers for viewer’s attention, such as Facebook’s Live video feature, says Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. The problem, as Olson sees it, is that YouTube has had trouble persuading TV and movie studios to license more of their content on their site, something that that might have made YouTube as dominant in video as Google is in search. But YouTube could be on a major breakthrough, according to a report published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal. Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Google had reached an agreement with CBS to include its network in a cable-like service called “Unplugged” that will debut on YouTube next year. Google is also negotiating for the rights to the Fox network, ESPN and NBC, among others, the Journal said. Google cited YouTube licensing rights as one of the reasons that its costs to generate revenue, excluding ad commissions, rose by $1 billion, or 30 percent, from last year. “The dam appears to be finally cracking” for even better content to come to YouTube, Olson said.

Skip to content 52 Tiger Menu Home Begin Here Contact RSS feeds Search for: Switching from iPhone to Pixel October 30, 2016 / Dave Caolo / Leave a comment I wanted to Photoshop a Pixel into Judas’ hand but I don’t know how to do that. So imagine that it’s there. “You’re a traitor.” – My 13-year-old daughter to me, as I purchased my Google Pixel XL. After nine years of iPhone ownership, I’ve switched to Android by buying a Google Pixel XL. This article is about why. Let me begin with what did not motivate my decision. First: I love the iPhone. When I picked up the original model on June 29, 2007, I declared it, “The coolest thing I’ve ever owned.” Subsequent models have only reinforced that assertion with huge leaps in features, design, utility and fun. The iPhone defined a market and created several cottage industries, from case manufacturers to blogs and podcasts that feature reviews, opinions and discussions around the device’s present and future. The App Store is an economy that provides a sustaining income for developers, designers, copy writers and more. That little slab of metal and glass has been my constant companion for nearly a decade, providing entertainment, timely reminders, easy communication with friends and family, near ubiquitous, on-demand access to work files, gorgeous photos and more reliably and with grace. I love the iPhone and did not by a Pixel as a reaction to some gripe with Apple. So why did I switch? A few reasons. The time is right I’ve always been Android-curious. I’ve taken glimpses over Android-wielding friends’ shoulders over the past few years, but rarely liked what I saw. Android seemed like an OS built for developers, not civilians like me. Likewise, I dislike the model that divorces hardware and software development. As a result, my curiosity about Android remained just that: curiosity. Meanwhile, I slowly and quite unintentionally added Google apps and services to my iPhone. The Google App for iPhone is fantastic for reminders, scheduling, search and timely news. I check it several times per day and love it. Google Calendar has been my choice for years, and Google Photos has managed my digital image library since it was first released. Likewise, I’ve been using Google Docs and Drive to collaborate for as long as I can remember. At the same time, I abandoned Apple’s Calendar, Photos, News and Pages. Not intentionally or even consciously. It’s just that Google’s solutions worked beautifully on my iPhone, so I used them. Enter the Pixel Google’s Pixel announcement happened just as I was thinking about replacing my iPhone 6S. I was intrigued by a piece of hardware designed by Google, running “pure” Android with deep integration with the services I loved. I held off on the iPhone 7 and took some time to read reviews: Dieter Bohn liked it. Walt Mossberg liked it. Joanna Stern liked it. John Gruber sent me a brief but glowing “Twitter review.” Myke Hurley had nice things to say.* I watched several hands-on videos and listened to – a first here – a couple of episodes of the Android Central Podcast. The hosts were nit-picky but overall enthusiastic. I felt a stirring inside. The time was right. Which leads me to… I want the fun of an adventure I have two children. I try to instill in them a sense of adventure and curiosity about our world. Here’s a quick story. Recently we spent a long weekend out of state. At one point, we needed to get a new charger for his iPad. He was annoyed that his charger and died, and even more bothered when I told him that he’d come with me to find a replacement. “Why can’t you just go?” he asked. “You don’t want to come? It’ll be an adventure!” “Going to Best Buy is not an adventure.” But it is. We’re in a new state. We’re in a town we’ve never seen before. We’ll travel through new (to us) neighborhoods, see new people and yes, visit a new strip mall. There was a little mom-and-pop corner store that we went into and saw a black-and-white photo of a man in a chicken suit. I got a Coke and we talked to the cashier. He told us about local legend Chicken Man and pointed us to Best Buy. As we drove back to the hotel, my son said, “That was fun.” It was. Using an Android phone for the next two years will be an adventure. It will be fun. Oh, there will be things I’ll miss, like Twitterrific, Spark, iMessages (I’m REALLY going to miss iMessages) and something I’m calling Knowing How To Operate My Damn Phone, but I’m still looking forward to it. The time is right. The device is right. I might hate it; I might love it. I’m eager to find out. Of course, I’ll be writing exhaustively about the process here. The adventure begins on Tuesday. See you then. *Myke offers a bit of “real talk” on the episode of his vlog about his own Pixel XL. He says, in part: “I can switch phones. It’s totally fine. We’re not fighting a war here, from device to device, from operating system to operating system. Apple isn’t an underdog anymore. Android isn’t an underdog. They’re both levelly placed on this huge playing field…It’s totally fine for people to like two tech companies, three tech companies, four tech companies and enjoy the products that they make.” Amen, Myke. Now please explain that to my daughter, OK?

The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc’s Google, which crashed Apple Inc’s smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 per cent of the world’s smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach — more akin to Apple’s tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel’s hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year’s phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google’s Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company’s voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s Cortana. “We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information,” Rakowski said in an interview. Colourful dots The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn’t enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a “whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button.” The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words “OK Google.” By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google “doesn’t have to do negotiations with another handset maker – they can make it as tight as they want,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. Assistant integration In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers’ Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. “We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do,” he said “We don’t want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way.” He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. “You can’t do some of the always-on ‘OK Google’ detection on some phones because they don’t include the right hardware to do that,” he said. “In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position.” Samsung challenge Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world’s top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence start-up founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.” Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Tranactions’ pie Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant — such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others’ hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. “As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other… It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” Prev postNext post Share tweet TOPICS Previous: Mumbai: Runway maintenance to hit CSIA operations Next: Smartphone Shipments in India Grew 23 Percent Year-on-Year in Q3, Says Counterpoint Related Posts Microsoft Cybersecurity Way Too Anti-Competitive, Says Kaspersky Harman Is Samsung's $8 Billion Ticket Into the Automotive Tech Race Adtech Platform TubeMogul Acquired by Adobe CFO of Former HP Company Autonomy Indicted on Fraud Charges Facebook Users to Social Media Giant: We're Not Dead Yet!

Stolen and mis-issued SSL certificates allow attackers to spin up malicious sites that pass browser security checks, allowing for near-perfect replica sites to be created. When those sites fake services like online banking or other services that see punters hand over credentials or credit card details, unpleasant occurrences aren't far behind. Google's Certificate Transparency initiative, adopted as a standard by the Internet Engineering Taskforce, helps to shutter the attack vector by flagging sites with unauthorised certificates and labelling those that do not subscribe to the initiative as untrusted. Certificate Authorities must comply with the scheme to avoid their customers' sites being labelled as untrusted. Those authorities that sign on will demonstrate that certificates are legitimate, and not incorrectly issued for the wrong domains. It would seek to end incidents like the handing of the base certificate for GitHub to British programmer Gervase Markham in August by authority WoSign in one of the latest of a line of similar blunders. The theory is that opening the issuance of SSL certificates to greater scrutiny to domain owners and users, and certificate authorities will make it "very difficult" for criminals to obtain a SSL certificate for domains they do not own. If criminals gain such a certificate from a dodgy or incompetent authority, affected domain owners and others will be notified. Google software engineer Ryan Sleevi says by this time next year Chrome users, who comprise around half of all net surfers, will be told sites that do not comply with Certificate Transparency must be considered dangerous. "This past week at the 39th meeting of the CA/Browser Forum, the Chrome team announced plans that publicly trusted website certificates issued in October 2017 or later will be expected to comply with Chrome’s Certificate Transparency policy in order to be trusted by Chrome," Sleevi writes . "The Chrome Team believes that the Certificate Transparency ecosystem has advanced sufficiently that October 2017 is an achievable and realistic goal for this requirement." Sleevi says Certificate Transparency has "profoundly altered how browsers, site owners, and relying parties" are able to detect fake certificates and flag those as bad. Google has requested irked certificate authorities to forward their thoughts on the initiative for consideration. The initiative determines bad certificates using logs, public server monitors, and light software auditors. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 23 Comments More from The Register Mozilla plots TLS 1.3 future for Firefox Quicker handshake starts encrypting data sooner 7 Comments User danger declines as two thirds of Chromistas now use HTTPS With Google goggles on, Chrome security performance outshines other browsers 9 Comments Edgier Edge pledge: TLS fledge no speed wedge, Redmond man said Faster, stronger crypto comes to baked-in browser 4 Comments Facebook's own TLS cert used by crooks in double logon phish Phish me once, shame on Facebook; phish me twice, shame on Facebook anyway 12 Comments Google adds worldwide HTTPS info to transparency report Feds want less crypto, Google wants more 10 Comments Come in HTTP, your time is up: Google Chrome to shame leaky non-HTTPS sites from January Web giant will start labeling insecure websites insecure 95 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

The Pixel and the Pixel XL are Google's newest flagships released in Oct. 20.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google's self-branded flagships, the Pixel and the Pixel XL, are the company's major inroad in ensuring a formidable spot in the highly competitive smartphone race, even making sure those who want to switch would be welcomed with an easy transition. While both the Pixel and the Pixel XL come with a hefty price tag, they do sport some of the best specs found on a smartphone, with the "best smartphone camera" to boot, alongside being able to offer the best Android experience ever on a phone, since Google worked both on the hardware and the software, resulting in a healthy synergy of a software and hardware combo with intent and purpose. The phones run on Google's latest OS, Android 7.0 Nougat, which boasts additional features not available on other smartphones, including a system-wide Google Assistant functionality and a custom Android UI. Despite the shipping woes brought by overwhelming demand of the phones, those of you who have already gotten hold of the Pixel or the Pixel XL should read on if you want to know a few tips in order to get more out of your phone and even decrease battery consumption. Turn Off Keyboard Vibration Apart from slowing down key input, keyboard vibrations do take a swig out of your battery's juice each time, so it's wiser to just turn it off altogether since haptic feedback doesn't really feel like pressing a button, to nobody's surprise. Go to Settings, then tap Languages & Input, then tap Virtual keyboard, then tap Google keyboard, then tap Preferences and toggle the "vibrate on keypress" off. While you're there, you can go ahead and turn off keyboard sounds too. Turn On Night Light Mode It's been proven that the smartphone screens actually hamper our ability to go into a deep slumber, and the night light feature tries to remedy that by laying over a warmer hue during evenings to avoid eye strain. Tap Settings, then display and then turn on night light. Turn On The Battery Percentage Indicator If you're like most people who are extremely meticulous about keeping track of your phone's battery life, then you can head on over to the notifications panel to turn the battery indicator on. Hold the system icon for a few seconds and then release. A hidden System UI tuner will appear at the bottom of the settings menu. Open it, then tap Status bar and choose to show the battery percentage level. Change How Big UI Elements Are There's a new option to set the size of how big certain user interface elements should appear. You can select this one by going over to Settings and then hitting display. In it you'll find a slider that increases or decreases screen elements to your liking. Split-Screen Multitasking Tap and hold the "recents" button in order to access the multitasking screen. From there you can choose another app that would run on the second half of the display area. Access One-Handed Mode If you're lugging another piece of item on your free hand and you have no choice but to type with just one hand, you can press and hold the "return" button while the keyboard is open. A new icon will appear, depicting a single hand holding a screen. Tap this to go into one-handed mode. These are just some of the tips among many others for you to get the most out of your new Pixel or Pixel XL phone. You can purchase the the Google Pixel or the Google Pixel XL at Google's own online store. TAG Google, Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Google unveiled AMP about a year ago and hundreds of companies are now publishing AMP versions of their articles, including the Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, Hearst, The Guardian, the New York Times, Vox Media and many others. In recent months Google has begun including many more links to stripped-down AMP pages in its mobile search results. This has directed more traffic to those AMP pages and less to publishers’ full mobile websites. Google said in a Sept. 21 blog post that AMP search results would be introduced across search engine results pages worldwide “in the coming weeks.” For some publishers that is a problem, since their AMP pages do not currently generate advertising revenue at the same rate as their full mobile sites. Multiple publishers said an AMP pageview currently generates around half as much revenue as a pageview on their full mobile websites. That’s largely because of limitations related to the types of ad units AMP pages will allow and the ad technology providers that are currently integrated with the platform, those publishers say. For example, AMP pages rely heavily on standardized banner ad units, and don’t allow publishers to sell highly-customized ad units, sponsorships or pop-up ads as they might on their own properties. It’s a similar dynamic to the one many publishing executives described in the early days of Facebook’s Instant Articles platform, which enables publishers to post content directly to the social network. Facebook eventually tweaked some of its advertising policies in an attempt to address those concerns. Google’s vice president of news, Richard Gingras, said the company is happy with the progress AMP has made in terms of the ad capabilities it offers publishers. However, he believes some publishers are failing to wring maximum revenue from their AMP traffic because of the way their advertising technology systems are implemented. Publishers that make full use of the ad tools available to them in AMP are seeing revenue results comparable to what they earn on their full mobile web pages, he said. “We want to drive the ecosystem forward, but obviously these things don’t happen overnight,” Mr. Gingras said. “The objective of AMP is to have it drive more revenue for publishers than non-AMP pages. We’re not there yet”. Publishers who are critical of AMP were reluctant to speak publicly about their frustrations, or to remove their AMP content. One executive said he would not comment on the record for fear that Google might “turn some knob that hurts the company.” A website’s ranking in Google’s search results isn’t impacted by whether it has AMP pages, Mr. Gingras reiterated. Still, some publishers believe an eventual prioritization of AMP pages is inevitable. “Publishers who are not using AMP will probably be penalized,” said Philippe Guelton, chief executive of SheKnows Media. Publishers who were willing to speak on the record were generally happy with AMP. They acknowledged the shift in traffic from their full mobile sites to AMP pages, but have a positive outlook on AMP’s ad revenue potential. Visits to CNN’s AMP pages are beginning to replace visits to the full version of its mobile website. CNN has seen an 80% increase in AMP traffic since September, and more than 20% of search traffic to CNN now directs to AMP pages, according to CNN chief product officer Alex Wellen. For CNN, visits to its full mobile site and its AMP pages “largely monetize at the same rate,” Mr. Wellen said, although that could change as it begins to introduce more ad formats to its mobile web pages. “We’ll need assurances from Google that the AMP pages can accommodate these executions; otherwise, we’ll have to reevaluate whether the economic and product tradeoffs make sense,” he said. Vox Media’s The Verge has witnessed a similar trend, according to a recent post published by Editor-in-chief Nilay Patel. As The Verge’s AMP pageviews have increased, pageviews to its full website are decreasing. AMP represented 14% of traffic to The Verge in September, Mr. Patel said. The Washington Post is able to generate approximately the same amount of revenue from AMP pages as it can from pageviews on its full mobile site, according to its director of product, Joey Marburger. Some 15% of mobile traffic to The Washington Post is now directed to AMP pages, he said. Mr. Guelton said SheKnows “doesn’t really mind” if search traffic is directed to AMP pages or the full version of its site, since it can generate ad revenue in both places. In terms of ad limitations within AMP pages, Mr. Guelton suggested those are necessary to fulfil AMP’s promise of improving the user experience by loading content faster. “Consumers are indicating that they want a better experience overall, so I don’t think it’s a negative,” Mr. Guelton said.

I’ve said to myself throughout this election cycle, “One of these days, people will regret voting for Hillary Clinton.” And it looks like some are feeling that way a bit more early than expected. I was browsing Twitter when something caught my eye; a Google Trends graph that showed popular search trends. Apparently, the news that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation is causing folks to have second thoughts about voting for her. It’s a story I covered yesterday, detailing several theories about the emails and investigation itself. The graph showed a spike in the search term, “can you change your early vote?” The phrase was practically nonexistent, snaking along a seven-day graph at zero until around 5 p.m. on Friday evening, when it shot up to a search interest volume index of 100 suddenly. Interestingly, the phrase, “I’m with her” plummeted to just over 25 at the same time. Early voting began this week in several states, and Clinton has long advocated for early voting as a means to gain traction against her opponents and to also reduce the impact that negative revelations such as the FBI case against her could have. Now, the specifics of the buyer’s remorse search don’t say whether it’s in relation to Clinton or Donald Trump, but we can deduce who’s doing the searching based on several things: when the news that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation, when Trump’s rape case gained traction, and normal search trends over a period of time. And the results are fairly damning for Clinton, and to a lesser extent for Trump. Let’s look at Clinton’s Google searches first. First, I narrowed down the search to the last seven days to give me an idea about whether people were searching for these things or not. Secondly, I made it specific to the United States to localize the results. I used five color-coded search terms, which is the maximum number you can use. Blue: Can you change your early vote Red: I’m with her Yellow: Hillary Clinton innocent Green: Hillary Clinton Wiener Purple: Is Clinton better than Trump Seven day trend for these searches. #CanYouChangeYourEarlyVote spiked at 5pm on Friday afternoon. pic.twitter.com/IocD7y30LO — Reno Berkeley (@RenoBerkeley) October 31, 2016 What I found intriguing when I first saw the results is how low “I’m with her” falls on the Google Trends bar. For the last seven days, the search volume index has consistently been below 50, often dipping to below 25. Ever since the news that Comey was reopening the investigation, though, it has only reached over 25 in two, brief spurts on October 29. A little before 5 p.m. on Friday afternoon, the search term “Hillary Clinton Wiener” shot from a search volume index of zero to just over 25. Shortly thereafter, “Can you change your early vote” went from nearly nothing to a search volume index of 100. That means a lot of people — many of whom were likely early voters — were wondering if there was a way to take it back. The search terms “Hillary Clinton innocent” and “Is Trump better than Clinton ” both had low search volume indexes, meaning not a lot of people have been interested in those questions. What interests people, though, is the possibility that Anthony Wiener’s sexting scandal led the FBI to discover a treasure trove of emails on a laptop he likely shared with estranged wife and Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. The Wall Street Journal reports that these emails number over a half million, which the FBI discovered weeks ago. Next, we’ll look at some Trump searches and see if they also fit a pattern for early voting regrets. Blue: Trump rape case Red: Make America Great Again Yellow: Miss USA Pageant Green: Can you change your early vote Purple: Donald Trump Russia What I found with Trump was, not many people care about whatever connections he might have with Russia, but a huge number of people want to know about making American great again. This search is consistently high. However, the rape case against him and the early voting regret seem to correlate, but the search interest volume index indicates that the searches happened further apart, so the correlation between the two is harder to see. With Clinton, the early voting regret search spiked a bit more closely to the FBI announcement. [Image by Evan Vucci/AP Images] Other than early voting regret, what else are people searching for on Google? “Hillary for prison” peaked at around noon on Friday, October 28, while “Drain the swamp” rocketed to a search index volume of 100 on Saturday around 5 p.m. It’s fairly clear that neither candidate is much loved by Americans by and large, but Trump seems to have more enthusiastic support than does Clinton. In fact, the Google Trends searches indicate that voting remorse is more likely with Clinton than it is with Trump. As a side note: NBC News has confirmed that the FBI has gotten a warrant to search Wiener’s laptop, while Senator Harry Reid lashed out at James Comey for allegedly violating the Hatch Act, which bars individuals from using their authority to influence elections. I’m not a statistician, nor am I a mathematician. But I have eyes, and I can see what’s before me. I can tell without much effort what these search terms mean: Americans are suffering from a deep sense of despair and regret. They are in pain. They are worried. They want a president they can trust and count on, not a pathological liar, an alleged rapist, or a warmongering national security risk. People have awakened to the realization that voting is but a sham, a means for the political elite to placate an increasingly angry populace. The political elite owe the American people an apology for putting forth two horribly bad candidates at a critical time in our nation’s history. It’s not enough that folks are wondering if they can change their early voting choice, because no matter who wins, the results could be, quite frankly, disastrous.

Life Buy/Sell Nation AP Where Americans need the most help carving pumpkins By Christopher Ingraham Washington Post Oct 30, 2016 (…) A little more than one-third of Americans told Gallup in 2006 that they “usually” celebrate Halloween by carving a pumpkin. And, if Google search data is to be believed, some of us have a more natural knack for making faces out of orange gourds than others. There’s a pretty massive volume of searches for the phrase “how to carve a pumpkin” between 2004 and 2016. That phrase is a pretty useful proxy for pumpkin-carving ineptitude: Search it yourself, and you can see the top results include how-to’s from the likes of Martha Stewart (“Tip: Prevent exposed areas of the pumpkin’s flesh from turning brown by applying a film of Vaseline”), extremepumpkins.com (“I personally use power tools and extreme techniques, but many of the methods that I use to carve pumpkins apply to anyone”), and the New York Times (“An annual tradition like carving a jack-o’-lantern can become a mindful moment by cultivating what is known as beginner’s mind”). In other words, people Googling “how to carve a pumpkin” need help with the basic mechanics of the task, such as stabbing, cutting and the scooping out of guts. According to Google, the states most lacking in this fundamental knowledge are clustered mostly in the South — Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi all lead the nation in how-to pumpkin carving searches. North Dakota and Hawaii also stand out as places with a relatively high interest in pumpkin tutorials. On the flip side, New England, the Great Lakes region and parts of the plains show a relatively low amount of these searches, suggesting that folks in these places are able to get right to it without needing to consult an instruction manual. To put it another way, Google’s numbers show that somebody in Kentucky, Louisiana or Mississippi is more than twice as likely to seek online help for pumpkin carving than a person in Vermont or Oregon, the states with the lowest volume of these searches. Some of the geographic divide in pumpkin know-how may be related to the distribution of pumpkin farming — some of the places with high Google searches don’t have much native pumpkin cultivation, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As always with Google data, it’s worth pointing out that these are indicators of relative search volume, not raw numbers of searches. It’s not known exactly how many people are searching for pumpkin-carving help in any state. But it’s possible to compare the results for “how to carve a pumpkin” with other searches to get some sense of this. For instance, the broader term “pumpkin carving,” which yields results related to inspiration and carving ideas, gets about 20 times the search volume that the more specific “how-to” search does. This suggests that most of us already have a firm grasp of the basics and are ready to move on to more advanced questions, such as which Minion design to use this year. In 2015, growers in the six leading states, including Illinois, produced about 754 million pounds of pumpkins, according to the USDA.

While the Google Pixel isn’t exactly as open to hacking and modding as its Nexus predecessors, that isn’t stopping the Android community from forcing their way to more control over the device. Things are more complicated with the Verizon model of the device, given how its bootloader isn’t even unlockable, at least not officially and not easily. Fortunately for power users and modders, both issues are now practically solved, thanks to the ever so resourceful Chainfire and the SunShine developers’ dePixel8 tool. Unlike jailbreaking on iOS, rooting on Android is still pretty much en vogue. In some cases, it’s even necessary for some tasks still not provided by the OS itself or third-party utilities. Most OEM devices are notorious for implementing this or that security feature to either block or at least discourage rooting. Nexus devices, in contrast, while not explicitly supporting it, does at least make it easier for developers to hack into the device. The Google Pixel, however, is a completely different breed of Android smartphone. In this incarnation, Google has opted to act more like a traditional OEM with a “special” device that is directed more towards consumers than power users and developers. There was a bit of worry that it will just as hard to root. So far, however, it was just another challenge to overcome. Chainfire was able to achieve a systemless root on the Google Pixel and has now finally made the tools and images needed to root the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. The process requires an unlocked bootloader, which presented a problem for those who bought theirs from Verizon. That is also now a thing of the past, at least for now, with the dePixel8 tool unlocking that bootloader as well. The process, however, is not for the faint of heart, more than with previous Nexus devices. And as rooting is practically a game of cat and mouse between hackers and Google, there is no assurance that these methods will still work after next month’s security update. Also still uncertain is whether Pixel smartphones rooted using Chainfire’s tools will still be able to receive OTA updates in the future.

Google has rolled out multiple major algorithm updates in the past few years, including the Panda, Penguin and Hummingbird updates. Each new iteration targets a different element of “web spam” as Google’s team attempt to clean up search results. But sometimes, unsuspecting local businesses get caught in the crossfire. “In some cases it’s just because they don’t know they’re doing something wrong – for example, having the exact same content across multiple pages on the site. But often it’s actually their own SEO company causing the problem by using spammy, outdated practices,” McSherry said. While it’s sometimes possible to recover a website after a penalty, it’s an expensive process with no guarantees of success. “It depends on the type of penalty, but in many cases it would cost more to remove the penalty than to simply start over with a new website,” he said. “Even if a penalty is removed, there’s no guarantee the website will actually bounce back to previous traffic levels. That’s why it’s so important to spot risks and correct problems before a penalty strikes in the first place.” Premium SEO helps New Zealand businesses identify penalties and penalty risk as part of their free website audit.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 31 October 2016 Google pledges to give more by sharidan m. ali Sajith told StarBiz that Google is also taking part in both the judging and the final awards night this year. “Other things that we are doing for the industry include bringing in more talent via a programme called Ignite which we are partnering with MAA. “This involved the training of about 2,000 university students in digital marketing,” he pointed out. KUALA LUMPUR: Google, the exclusive sponsor of the upcoming Effie Awards 2016, is determined to contribute more to Malaysia’s marketing and advertising industry. Google Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines managing director Sajith Sivanandan said it was important for an organisation like Google to contribute to the industry and the Effie Awards is one of the platforms which it has a symbiotic partnership with. Effie is an effectiveness award based on proven results in the marketplace. This year, the Effie Awards, themed “When the going gets tough, the tough get effective”, is organised by the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents Malaysia and jointly supported by the Malaysian Advertisers Association (MAA) and Media Specialists Association. The awards ceremony and gala dinner will be held on Nov 4 at the KL Hilton. Sajith told StarBiz that Google is also taking part in both the judging and the final awards night this year. “Other things that we are doing for the industry include bringing in more talent via a programme called Ignite which we are partnering with MAA. “This involved the training of about 2,000 university students in digital marketing,” he pointed out. “We want to provide enough training opportunities because there is an increasing awareness and desire in the workforce on how to develop effective digital and intent based campaigns. “There is also a short supply of talents in Malaysia and most parts of the world,” he added. In line with Effie Awards thrust on effectiveness of marketing, Sajith said intent-based marketing, as opposed to the demographic based marketing, is a more powerful strategy to reach out to consumers based on their intent and likings. “These signals or sources of intent could be derived from the consumers search trend on Google or YouTube for instance, content they share with others, websites they have visited among others. “Not all marketers realised the power of intent marketing and it may take some time for the industry to be more aware to adopt this strategy,” he said. Sajith also noticed that over the last three to four years, there was a secular shift in terms of digital penetration in Malaysia where the trend is not just a flash in the pan. “Now about 75% of Malaysians are connected to the digital world, smart phone penetration in the country is now at 70% and it is growing pretty fast. “For example, three or four years back the level of watch time on YouTube was quite low at a single-digit but currently about 50% of YouTube watch time is done on smartphones and the trend is here to stay. “Basically, this is supported by the availability of all these great digital services which encouraged people to spend more time online. “People are having hundreds to thousands of micro moments online in their daily activities. They are either shopping, searching for information or looking for entertainment among other things,” he said.

Chaos in capital ... read more Secretive company teaches robots to be more like people Last updated 12:52, October 31 2016 Kindred founder Suzanne Gildert, left, and chief executive Geordie Rose with Thormang, a full scale humanoid robot used for research. You've ordered a robot online and are booting it up at home. At first the bot doesn't do much of anything; it simply follows you around and observes your daily routine: walking the dog, making lasagna, washing the dishes. But before long the bot has learned to be your surrogate, shouldering quotidian tasks so you can focus on more interesting ones. That's the world envisioned by Suzanne Gildert and Geordie Rose. They run Kindred, an ultra-secretive artificial intelligence company funded in part by Google's venture capital arm. Gildert and Rose started Kindred on the principle that the best way to make robots as smart as humans, is to put them in our shoes, and teach them to learn the same way we do. READ MORE:  * Everything you think you know about AI is wrong * Google's computers are creating songs * Why artificial intelligence could be the ultimate prize With the help of an all-star advisory board of AI experts, Kindred is already making progress toward that audacious goal. "Humans and AIs working together to control robots are always better than either by themselves," said Rose. Teaching computers to learn on their own is the core aim of AI research. The world's largest tech companies, including Facebook, Google and China's Baidu, are all racing to develop the best techniques. There have been breakthroughs in speech and image recognition, but machines still struggle to handle basic physical tasks such as grasping objects. Ad Feedback Improving robots' physical dexterity is the first problem Kindred is trying to tackle. Gildert, a physicist by training, came up with the idea of using human control to train robot algorithms while working at D-Wave, a Rose-founded company that's become a force in quantum computing, an esoteric technology that bypasses physical laws to crunch data faster than traditional machines. He was trying to figure out the best way to train machines how to move like humans but, unlike image recognition algorithms that can tap into reams of pictures on the web, there wasn't an obvious set of training data. "That doesn't exist," Gildert said. "The light bulb moment was, 'well, a human could supply that training data by moving the robot and if you want good training data you need an immersive situation."' Gildert and Rose left D-Wave in 2014 to found Kindred. Since then they've assembled some 50 robots for testing purposes. In a typical experiment, a human operator wears a virtual reality headset to "see" what the robot is seeing and uses handheld controllers to help the machine pick up an object. Every time the human helps the bot, the algorithms use the data to learn and make the machine smarter over time. The technique lets robots do things they can't do right now on their own while simultaneously making them more capable, Rose said. Eventually, he says, the techniques could be applied to more abstract tasks, like learning how to make someone laugh or intuit how they're feeling. He calls the current technology "proto-intelligences" akin to great-great-grandparents of what one day will be true, human-level AI. Rose assembled his team, which has grown to include 34 people, by drawing on contacts he made while selling D-Wave's multimillion-dollar machines to Google, the US government and other organisations. Kindred's advisory board includes such heavyweights as Russ Salakhutdinov, who recently became Apple's director of AI research. "Very rarely do you see this level of top-50 people in the deep learning space in one company," said Andy Wheeler, a partner at Google Ventures who led the firm's investment in Kindred. At some point, Kindred plans to publish its findings in academic journals or present them at conferences, a practice AI researchers employ to validate their breakthroughs and invite others to build on them. "Obviously it's too early to say is this definitely the way we get to real machine intelligence," Wheeler said. But Kindred's unique approach and all-star team convinced him to invest. Kindred is now focusing on bringing its work into the real world through partnerships with existing industrial robotics companies, said Rose, who declined to discuss specific discussions or agreements. "We saw an opportunity to use that existing base of robots that will be out there in the world in their hundreds of thousands," Gildert said. Take the role of sorting boxes in a warehouse run by Amazon or Wal-Mart. A single human operator could be plugged into multiple robots, stepping in when they run into a problem but otherwise letting them pick up and re-arrange the boxes on their own. The more robots Kindred can plug into, the more data it will have to train its algorithms on, creating a snowball effect, Gildert said. Eventually, the company's technology could be used to help make multi-purpose robots that can learn any task - from packing groceries to conducting a symphony to cheering up someone who's sad - simply by watching how humans do those things. "The opportunity here to build general-purpose machines that have the plethora of capabilities that humans have is unprecedented," Rose said.  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Digital Living story: British granny creates 'emoldjis' that all seniors can relate to Technology Homepage technology headlines Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?
