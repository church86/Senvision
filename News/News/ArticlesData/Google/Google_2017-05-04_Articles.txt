The updated system is currently rolling out on Android devices. Google mentioned the new anti-phishing measure in a blog post, saying this addition should keep you safer. When you click on a suspicious link inside of Gmail, the website will now throw up a pop-up warning that: "The site you are trying to visit has been identified as forgery, intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal, or other sensitive information." Users will, of course, still be able to bypass the system and visit the link, with Google conceding that it may encounter some false positives with this system. However, the company says it hopes warnings like these, similar to other security features that have been in place for years, will hopefully make people be a bit more involved and cautious about their actions online. The new system, currently rolling out in waves, comes just as a phishing scam has been making the rounds on Gmail, which tricked users into disclosing information by clicking on a seemingly-legitimate Google Docs link. Luckily, that threat has been mitigated over the past few days.

The Google Doc phishing scam that conned over a million users this week illustrates how attackers cleverly respond to wider spread end-user awareness about how phishing attacks work. The attack didn't ask users to enter credentials. Instead, it exhibited very few traditional phishing scam behaviors and couldn't have been detected by endpoint protections. Some researchers are calling this attack a "game changer" that could be just the start of a new wave of attacks that take advantage of third-party authentication connections rampant in the cloud services-based economy.  The attack tricked victims into clicking a link that gave attackers access to their Google Drive through OAuth authentication connections commonly used by third-party applications. The attackers did so by sending victims lure messages claiming to contain links to a shared Google Doc. Instead of a legit document, the link actually initiates a process to give a phony app masquerading as "Google Docs" access to the user's Google account. If the user is already logged into Google, the connection routes that app into an OAuth permissions page asking the user to "Allow" access to the user's legitimate Google Drive. "You aren't giving your Google credentials directly to the attacker. Rather, OAuth gives the attacker permissions to act on behalf of your account. You're on the real Google permissions page. OAuth is a legitimate way to give third-party applications access to your account. The application name is 'Google Docs,' which is fake but convincing," says Jordan Wright, R&D engineer for Duo Security. "So unless you know that Google Docs won't ask for your permissions, there is little you could use to determine that this was fake." Wright says that the attack exhibits worm-like behavior, using previous victims as the supposed sender of new scam messages to lull victims into a sense of security. The lure emails appear to come from Google Drive from a previous victim, making it difficult to detect as a fakeout, says Travis Smith, senior security researcher at Tripwire. "Not only does this have a casual appearance of being legitimate, by being part of the official marketplace the link in the email went back directly to legitimate Google servers," says Smith. "For those that are trained to validate the link before clicking on it, this passes two of the common techniques the majority of internet users are trained to not click on every link they come across: 'Does it come from someone you trust and validate the link is going to a trusted source?'" The only big tip-off is that many of the messages seem to have an suspicious account, [email protected] , cc'd on the message, says John Bambenek, threat research manager at Fidelis Cybersecurity. He says the attack shows the glaring problem with OAuth, namely that it allows passive authentication. "We talk about passwords and password security, but we don't really think a lot about these third-party apps we give access to," he says. "On Facebook and Twitter you fill out those dumb quizzes that give full access to everything in your Facebook account, but they're not thinking about handing that data to third parties. This is a case with the same dynamic." It's a tricky situation for enterprise security professionals seeking to safeguard their users because there is no quick fix here, says Ravi Balupari in a recent analysis for Netskope. "There has been no use of any malicious file for infecting, propagating, or data exfiltration. In this particular attack, all these phases have now transformed into using Google Gmail application and all the network traffic looks legitimate proving traditional network security devices incapable of protection," Balupari says. "There is absolutely no role of endpoint security products to detect and protect against such an attack." Netskope's analysis found that a number of enterprise users across various industries ended up falling prey to this attack. Google worked to quickly block the attack, but there was a window of opportunity in that time between compromise and mitigation where emails, contacts, attachments and whatever else on a Google account could have been purloined, he warns. "If an enterprise has identified that their users have granted access to the app in this attack, we recommend they conduct a full audit of the activities that were performed in Google Gmail after the permissions were granted to the app," Balupari writes.  New Rules The larger lesson to be learned here is that as phishing awareness campaigns grow more successful, attackers aren't going to take their ball and go home. Instead, they're changing the rules of the game. "This is somewhat of a game changer in the sense that there is little to point to as malicious," says Mounir Hahad, senior director of Cyphort Labs. "Any app out there can use Google’s API for authentication. For Google to respond to this kind of phishing attack is like a game of whack-a-mole. The widespread attacks will be relatively easy to identify and to respond to, but the more targeted ones will fly under the radar for a while." Security professionals should consider this a proof-of-concept for OAuth phishing in the future. According to researchers at Cisco, it is only a matter of time before copycat attacks against a wide range of cloud-based storage provider users starts cropping up. That's troubling considering current user behavior. According to the Dell End-User Security Survey, more than one in three employees will frequently open emails from unknown senders at work, and 56% of employees use public cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, and others for sharing or backing up their work.  While enterprises figure out how to deal with these threats technically, it is important to get users thinking critically not only about where they enter their credentials but also to whom - and to what - they assign permissions. "This campaign is an example of how an attacker doesn’t need to ask you for your username and password to gain access to your account. When looking at something asking you for permissions, don't approve out of habit, take a look and think why you would need to give something those permissions," Wright says. For example, a discerning user would know that Google Docs doesn't ask a user to provide access to Google Docs. "It already has it, essentially, as that's the nature of signing up for the service," says Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at AsTech, a security consultancy. "A quick moment to check before clicking on the link may reveal that it's not going where you expect or where it advertises itself to go." Additionally, enterprise IT needs to think about ways to mitigate these kinds of attacks in the future, including better segmentation and internal access controls to data, experts say. --Kelly Jackson Higgins contributed to this article.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 74 Plus 1 on G+ 313 Share on Facebook 119 Share on Twitter Total Shares506 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Stock Android is always buttery smooth. Even when it isn't. Louis Smith I'm in the same boat. Sold my OP3, Loved the phone, but someone else wanted it. I just kept on going back to my N6P.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

Last year Italian tax police alleged that Google had not paid tax on about 1 billion euros of Italian revenue between 2009 and 2013. “In addition to the taxes already paid in Italy during those years, Google will pay another 306 million euros,” a spokeswoman for the U.S. company said in an email. Both Google and the Italian tax office said the agreement covered the years between 2002 and 2015. Alphabet has been accused in Italy and other countries of avoiding taxes by booking income earned in higher-taxing European markets through a unit based in low-tax Ireland. The U.S. company has previously said it complied with tax rules in every country it worked. In a separate statement on Thursday the Italian tax office said the amount of more than 306 million euros which Google would pay was referenced to both Google Italy and Google Ireland units. “With Google a process will be kicked off to come up with preventive agreements for correct taxation in Italy in the future for operations that regard our country,” the tax office said.

The emails arrived in a user’s mailbox from an anonymous sender claiming to be delivered from a familiar contact. The email contained a convincing invitation to view a “Google Docs” file, with the subject line reading, “________ has shared a document on Google Docs with you,” and the body reading “________ has invited you to view the following document,” similar to an email from an actual invite. By clicking on the link, users give permission for a malicious app to connect to their Gmail accounts and to access their personal information. The app can also send emails from the impacted account, making it appear that subsequent emails are from that person. The hack does not only affect Gmail accounts, but any accounts that use Google’s email service, such as Cornell’s Cmail. Cornell IT posted a security alert about the phish at 3:51 p.m. Wednesday. “Cornell has taken steps to block the malicious websites,” the alert said. “Users who have clicked the link in an email should change their NetID password. Updates to this alert will be forthcoming.” “The funny part is that I was actually expecting an email from the person who didn’t realize they were phish-emailing me, so when I opened it I was not expecting it to be [suspicious] at all” Samuel Cantillo ’19 said. “Luckily I was on mobile and the Google Doc thing couldn’t correctly open for me.” But the phishers did not pull off the perfect scam, leaving several indicators that the “Google Docs” notification was not legitimate. One way to confirm that the email was malicious is that the email was addressed to “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com.” Another way to tell, according to some who got the phish, is by the layout. “At first sight it was good enough to fool me,” Cantillo said. “But the layout is pretty off. Google docs usually has the Google doc symbol when someone shares a doc with you – this one didn’t.” It is unclear who is behind the attack but Google said that it took steps steps to counter the attack. “We have taken action to protect users against an email spam campaign impersonating Google Docs, which affected fewer than 0.1% of Gmail users,” Google said in a statement to Gizmodo, a technology website. “We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions … We were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour.” And while Google admitted that some contact information was accessed, “our investigations show that no other data was exposed.” “There is no further action users need to take regarding this event,” Google added.

The relatives assert that by allowing Daesh militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group Daesh with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of Daesh over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Daesh shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google, and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases. 0 0 Families of San Bernardino shooting sue Facebook, Google, Twitter was posted in world of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on May 05, 2017 and was last updated on May 05, 2017.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology CyberSecurity Google was warned of Google Docs phishing technique 6 years ago The tech giant even rewarded the security researcher for flagging the vulnerability; the scam affected nearly 1 million users. By India Ashok May 5, 2017 06:25 BST Over 3,000 organisations were affected by the attackiStock The mass phishing scam that hit Google account holders this week has taken some bizarre twists and turns. The most shocking perhaps is that Google was warned of the possibility of such an attack six years ago but despite rewarding the security researcher who flagged the vulnerability, did not do enough to address it. In another interesting development a random Twitter user claimed responsibility for the mass phishing attack technique. A security researcher from the US said that he had warned the tech giant about this attack vector in 2012, for which he then awarded a "modest bounty." How many users were affected? CNet reported that attack by unknown hackers affected 0.1% of Gmail users. Google boasts of over 1 billion users, indicating that nearly 1 million users may have been affected by the attack. According to email security provider Agari, over 3,000 organisations were affected by the attack. "Based on information from the Agari Trust Network, we saw more than 3,016 organizations were compromised during the attack that sent 23,838 emails to Agari protected organizations," Agari told IBTimes UK. "According to Agari's data, the attack began on 3 May at 18:19 UTC, was curtailed dramatically at 19:49 with activity dramatically reduced until 21:37 when it ceased. We believe "patient zero" (the first compromise organization to initiate large scale worm replication) was a small K-12 school in a small town in Wisconsin," the firm said. Who launched the attack? On 3 May, shortly after news of the phishing attack began spreading, a Twitter user, using an email address with the name Eugene Pupov -- a name which also happened to match the sender of the mass phishing scam -- claimed responsibility for the attack. The Twitter user claimed that the phishing emails were a "test" for his university research project and not part of a scam campaign. The Twitter user claimed that he was a student with Coventry University. But, a report by Motherboard said the university confirmed that it has no student, current or old, by the name of Eugene Pupov. The Twitter account in question has been deleted, indicating that the individual who claimed the attack may have done it for a lark. It is not known if Twitter disabled the account or the user himself did it. Google knew about the attack vector Motherboard also said that, in 2012, security researcher Andre DeMarre had warned Google about the phishing technique, suggesting that the company address the issue by checking if the name of any given app matched the URL of the firm behind it. However, Google responded to DeMarre that they will not perform the URL validation. This decision was reportedly criticised by experts and DeMarre. McAfee chief scientist Raj Samani told IBTimes UK, "Phishing attacks remain the most common method of manipulating individuals into clicking on links and ultimately installing malicious content onto their systems." He said such attackers try to take advantage of trusted, well-known brands' in an effort attempt to "leverage the use of authority, resulting in the incoming messages to appear trusted to the consumer."

Now that Android Wear is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table comparing every watch. You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device. The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However, the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch snfaces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395. The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform. Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bābā ghanūj Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 74 Plus 1 on G+ 313 Share on Facebook 119 Share on Twitter Total Shares506 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws.

Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals.

In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

With over 1 billion monthly users and 2 trillion searches done annually, Google’s name has become synonyms with the word “search”. However, despite its complete dominance, Google is not the only web search engine on the internet. Yahoo and Microsoft’s Bing have also been around for a considerable time, but there is one new kid on the block that offers you more than just good search results. It offers you the chance of helping the environment with every search you make! Ecosia Ecosia is a web search engine, much like Google, Bing, or any other search engine you may have come across. Although it was started in 2009, it just recently started gaining attraction. It’s simple to use, has almost the same look and feel as Google (but without the Knowledge Graph capabilities of the latter). In terms of quality of search results, it also looks fairly same and offers decent results and is almost as fast. It uses the Yahoo! and Bing algorithms, which is actually a good thing as developing its own algorithms would have been a formidable task, especially compared to the veteran software giants like Google and Microsoft. Ecosia does have some of its own enhanced algorithms running on top of it. Although a little inferior in quality due to Google’s extraordinary prowess in search, Ecosia still provides a decent alternative. Here is a side-by-side comparison of a search on Ecosia and Google, What makes Ecosia different? “Ecosia plants trees with at least 80% of its ad revenue.” A major part of the ad revenue earned through ad placements on its search engine goes to the planting of new trees. Ecosia is the only search engine to be awarded a B Corporation status, a certification awarded to organizations that have a positive effect on the environment or have strong social and environmental standards. Trees are nature’s remedy for harmful environmental effects. Even if you have taken a few science classes, you know how trees can be beneficial for the environment. While some of their most obvious benefits include absorption of carbon dioxide and protection from soil erosion, forests also act as a home for millions of different species and regulate water cycles, preventing floods. So it is devastating to hear that nearly 15 billion trees are cut down each year. While there have been numerous tree planting campaigns in recent years, around the world as well as in Pakistan, we still have a long way to go to make up for that huge number and Ecosia wants to help. How do searches translate into trees? Ecosia earns an average of 0.5 cents (Euro) per search and planting a single new tree currently costs them 28 cents. Total Searches Per Tree = ? = Cost of one tree/ Cents per one search = 28 cents / 0.5 cents = 56 “It takes an average of 56 web searches to fund one tree.” Currently, the company has around 5.5 million active users and generates enough funds for the planting of a new tree roughly every 11 to 16 seconds. They have four ongoing projects right now: Alternatives to palm oil, Indonesia Re-greening the desert, Burkina Faso Planting with cooperatives, Peru Restoring coastal forests, Madagascar   The search engine also has a personal tree counter for every user, which shows the number of trees that you’ve personally contributed to by using Ecosia. The calculation is done by taking the number of searches done by you and the current average of seconds Ecosia needs to finance one tree into account. How can you contribute? All you have to do is start using Ecosia instead of any search engine. You can also make it your default search engine by going to its home page and clicking on “Add Extension”.

resumed in 1946 it has created household names, thrown up great rivalries and seen its fair share of controversy.  Belgian Eddy Merckx was the dominant figure during the 1970s while Frenchman Bernard Hinault made a name for himself in the early 1980s by winning both the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia.  In 1987 Irish rider went one better winning both Tours  and the UCI Road World Championship.

What you need to know Obsession with politicians’ appearance 'puts young women off politics' At the start of this century however, the tour, like the sport of cycling itself was marred by doping allegations. In 2010 Alberto Contador was stripped of his title after he was found guilty of doping in that year's Tour de France.  Among the favourites for this year's race is last-year's winner, the imperious Italian rider Vicenzo Nibali.  He rides for UCI WorldTeam Bahrain–Merida - one of 22 international teams competing in the contest of raw athleticism, tactics and above all, willpower.

Faculty members at St. Scholastica will use grant funding from Google to integrate CS education into the entire curriculum for students in the college’s teacher education programs. Faculty will be trained to incorporate computational thinking and computer science. “The lack of qualified CS teachers consistently ranks as a top reason why schools do not offer CS classes,” said Hai Hong of Google’s CS education team. “Working with pre-service preparation programs to support the next generation of CS teachers is a critical step to addressing the growing demand for CS education.” The project will be implemented by a team of St. Scholastica faculty members who are experienced in seeking innovative solutions to the issue of CS teacher shortages. “Computational thinking is a new literacy,” said Chery Takkunen Lucarelli, professor of education and grant principal investigator. “We want it embedded in the teacher candidate experience. Every teacher will have a foundation in computational thinking. “Our students are going to have a unique set of skills. Minnesota is not teaching computer science very well, but with this new knowledge, our students can go out into the schools and become change agents.” She added that the program aligns well with St. Scholastica’s mission of inclusivity. “We’re learning about how we can broaden participation, encourage and retain underrepresented students in the field,” Lucarelli said. “That’s really important to us and to Google.” Lucarelli and Jen Rosato, assistant professor of computer information systems, are leaders in this field, having previously received highly competitive grants through a funding program at Google called CS4HS—Computer Science for High Schools. The funding was used to show educators how to teach computer science principles through mobile app development. That program was also awarded grant funds from the National Science Foundation. The other participating colleges are the University of California at Irvine, the University of Texas at Austin, and Huston-Tillotson University. UTA and HTU are collaborating on the effort. ABOUT ST. SCHOLASTICA: The College of St. Scholastica is nationally recognized for quality. Rankings by U.S. News & World Report, Forbes, and Money magazine classify it as one of the Midwest’s top regional universities. Learn more at css.edu. ABOUT GOOGLE: Google creates products to increase access to opportunities for every student, break down barriers and empower people through technology. To help reach these goals, Google works to inspire young people around the world not just to use technology, but to create it.

When in comes to the consolidation of power and influence in greedy tech industry corporations, that may be the case. Natural News founder Mike Adams wrote about a week ago that the Google monopoly should be broken up for the benefit of consumers, the competitive marketplace, and free information flow. A Times Op-Ed seems to agree with the Health Ranger about Google in general, suggesting that the government may need to regulate the giant search engine like a public utility given its gatekeeping sway over web traffic and e-commerce. “We are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook and Amazon are the kinds of natural monopolies that need to be regulated, or whether we allow the status quo to continue, pretending that unfettered monoliths don’t inflict damage on our privacy and democracy,” wrote Jonathan Taplin , director emeritus of the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab. Postponing the decision may mean that breaking up Google (with its 88 percent market share in search advertising) and the other dominant Big Data entities may result in a situation where anti-trust laws will provide the only remedy, Taplin suggested. Earlier this year, Big-Pharma loving Google recently blacklisted Natural News on a flimsy pretext for six days and has a history of playing games with its search algorithm tweaks to the detriment of many businesses and alternative media websites. (Related: Read more about alternative media at Censored.news.) For most, if not all, Natural News readers, government intervention in the private sector is seldom, if ever, an effective solution. Breaking up the Google monopoly may be the only way to fully preserve freedom of speech on the web, Mike Adams explained, however. Google seems determined to enslave humanity in a delusional bubble of false information from “official” sources that only know how to LIE. Those sources, of course, all tend to be Leftist, liberal sources that have now repeatedly shown they are completely intolerant of all opposing views, labeling them “hate speech” even if they are reasoned, rational analysis or opinions.  Google-owned YouTube has also demonetized videos produced by independent journalists who don’t follow the progressive, globalist party line, effectively implementing a form of revenue-loss censorship. Recall that during the 2016 presidential campaign, Google was accused of manipulating auto-complete search results to suppress negative stories about Hillary Clinton. To the surprise of no one, Google staffers also supposedly worked directly on the Clinton campaign. Over the past eight years, Google lobbyists practically lived at the White House, and a revolving door of employment existed between the federal government and Google. As an alternative, the Health Ranger developed GoodGopher.com (which, unlike Google, doesn’t spy on the user), providing uncensored search results from thousands of independent media websites. Short of intrusive regulation, the Times essay suggests that Google should be disallowed from gobbling up any more tech firms and should no longer qualify for the DMCA safe-harbor clause that enables it to enjoy a “free ride on content produced by others.” Sources include: NYTimes.com NaturalNews.com Inquisitr.com   Previous :Trans fat ban linked to drastic drop in heart attacks and stroke, finds new study Join the Health Ranger's FREE email newsletter Get breaking news alerts on GMOs, fluoride, superfoods, natural cures and more...

Her gig on Thursday night—YouTube’s 2017 Brandcast—was only a little less gaudy. The Google-owned video behemoth pulled out all the stops as only a Google-owned video behemoth can with a star-studded presentation culminating in an after-dinner concert from the California Gurl herself. But beyond all the glitz and glamour (and there was plenty of it) YouTube had a consistent message for the roughly 2800 in attendance: TV is the past, YouTube is the future, and ad spending should reflect that. “YouTube is not TV, and we never will be,” CEO Susan Wojcicki said in her opening remarks. “The platform you helped create represents something bigger.” She added that even during TV’s primetime hours, more 18-49s visit YouTube on mobile alone than watch any TV network. YouTube creator Casey Neistat, who boasts more than seven million subscribers to his channel, dropped his mic to the stage as a visual to hammer home the same point. “Think of my hand as old media. TV. And the floor is YouTube. And the moment I released that microphone, being this generation, being the demographic, that the advertisers salivate over. There is no chance it would pause midair and go back up to my hand.” YouTube Chief Business Officer Robert Kynci introduced a new slate of original content, including a fitness series starring comedian Kevin Hart, a show that takes fans backstage with singer Demi Lovato, an Ellen Degeneres-led variety program, and a user-submitted music talent contest produced by Ryan Seacrest and sponsored by Johnson & Johnson. Perry announced that she will not only take part in “best. cover. ever.,” but also host a live listen-along for her new album during which she will interact with fans. Both Wojcicki and Kynci touted the growth of the Google Preferred advertising program, which allows brands to run their content against YouTube’s most popular content. Kynci noted the number of brands buying GP has tripled since it launched three years ago. Wojcicki also pushed recently introduced six-second “bumper” ads. As for recent complaints from brands and agencies about spots appearing alongside offensive or questionable content, Wojcicki  said “we have taken your feedback to heart. … We apologize for letting some of you down. I’m here to say that we can and we will do better.” Even with the addition of star-driven original content, YouTube’s core pitch revolved around the variety of content and the authenticity that comes with so much of that content being generated by average Joes. Presenters stressed the two-way interaction between content creators and viewers, the impact YouTube content has had in impacting social change and its role as a platform that gives everyone a voice. share this article previous storyPluto Partners Featured Stories <   > Featured Stories Screenster Hulu Bolsters Original Programming Screenster Digital Video Stealing Ad Dollars From Linear TV Screenster Dystopian Power: “The Handmaid’s Tale” Screenster By The Foot Screenster Live in Five: YouTube Launches Video Service in… Screenster WWE Network Approaches 2 Million Subs Related Stories Screenster YouTube Puts TV Ad Dollars… Screenster Effros: Unbundling Bad For Diversity Screenster Hulu Upfront: Streaming Service Unveils… The Latest Screenster You’ve Gotta a Friend: Viacom… Screenster YouTube Puts TV Ad Dollars… Screenster Effros: Unbundling Bad For Diversity Screenster Hulu Upfront: Streaming Service Unveils… Screenster Charter’s 1Q: TWC Sub Losses… Screenster Dishing It: DISH Takes on… Screenster Does Twitter’s Video Push Have… Screenster VR Focus: Hulu’s Noah Heller… Screenster Programming Screenster Broadband Legislation Get cable industry news in your inbox, daily!

The service has more than 1 billion users and is becoming a more important sales driver for the search giant. By Avi Salzman May 4, 2017 12:56 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Google Maps has the potential to be a bigger earnings driver for Alphabet, Google's parent company. Illustration: Getty Images/iStockphoto Google Maps is a wildly popular service, with over 1 billion users and climbing, but it’s not clear if the service does much for Google’s profits. There are ads on Google Maps, but the company doesn’t break out its specific contribution to Google’s sales and earnings. Nonetheless, Wall Street is intrigued by Google Maps’ success, and some analysts see it as a potential earnings driver. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote last year that Maps could bring in $1.5 billion in 2017: “Maps remains one of Google’s most under-monetized assets.” To put that $1.5 billion in context, Google’s parent company Alphabet is expected to make $107 billion this year, the vast majority of it from Google ads. More from Barron’s Next The One Number That Shows Trouble At Verizon When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare Uh-Oh Google, Amazon’s Growing Its Ad Business Google makes money on Maps by charging local businesses to have their listing show up as purple “pins” when people look for services near them. They can also make their business a “Promoted Place” that shows up even if people don’t search for anything. The company is also working with businesses to help them use Maps to improve their logistics operations – figuring out the fastest way to deliver food, for instance. The CEO’s comments on the company’s latest conference call only reinforced the idea that Maps is becoming a more powerful earnings-driver. CEO Sundar Pichai did not mention any specific numbers but made it sound like Maps is slowly becoming a bigger moneymaker. “We take a long-term view. It’s already impacting monetization very significantly for us with local search. So today when you use Google, a lot of the information we are able to do is because of Google Maps. But I’m sure you’ve noticed changes within Google Maps over the past few months. You know, if you open Google Maps, you’re traveling or you’re about on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, places to eat, and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users, and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there over time as well.” “Add value,” in this case, could refer to both helping customers and helping the company’s profits. Investors should certainly keep an eye on the potential. Big Picture: Google Maps could be a bigger earnings driver as local businesses use it to draw new customers.

The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided “material support” to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. “For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,” family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook’s co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

Related Articles What did Uber know, and when? Uber suspends driver in Australia over bomb plot allegation Uber self-driving car exec steps aside during Google lawsuit Uber fires back against Waymo lawsuit, says its tech is ‘fundamentally different’ from rival’s The investigation, in its early stages, deepens the crisis for the embattled company and its chief executive and founder, Travis Kalanick, who has faced a barrage of negative press this year in the wake of high-profile sexual harassment complaints, a slew of executive departures, and a consequential trade-secrets lawsuit from Google’s parent company. The federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters, focuses on software developed by Uber called “Greyball.” The program helped the company evade officials in cities where Uber was not yet approved. The software identified and blocked rides to transportation regulators who were posing as Uber customers in an effort to prove that the company was operating illegally. Uber declined to comment on the criminal investigation. The Justice Department declined to comment, citing its practice of not confirming or denying possible investigations. In a letter last week to Portland, Oregon, authorities, who had requested information about the program as part of a civil probe, Uber said greyballing refers to the practice of showing some customers a different version of the app than most customers see. Uber’s attorneys said the program was used “exceedingly sparingly” in Portland, and that the company had not used it since April 2015, when Portland adopted preliminary rules allowing Uber to operate. Uber, valued privately by investors at close to $70 billion, has a reputation among Silicon Valley companies for a hard-charging workplace culture that is driven by Kalanick himself. The 40-year-old is known as a quick-tempered and combative manager who aims to win at all costs and inspires fierce loyalty in his inner circle. In its earlier years, the company employed cutthroat tactics against its competitor Lyft. At one point, Uber employees would summon Lyft drivers and then cancel rides. Kalanick once bragged about a feature, called God View, that it used to track a journalist and other noteworthy individuals. He has charged into legal battles with transportation regulators and taxi drivers in cities across the world. Until recently, Uber emerged from its many controversies relatively unscathed. It had been on a rocket-ship trajectory, raising more than $12 billion in venture capital, poaching executive talent from Google, and setting up shop in 450 cities. But a series of crises this year has rocked the company and shaken Kalanick to his core, according to people who know him. In February, a female engineer wrote a blog post about a traumatizing experience of sexual harassment and retaliation from the company’s human resources department. After the post went viral, Kalanick apologized and hired former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. to investigate the allegations. The crises continued when, later that month, Kalanick was videotaped verbally attacking an Uber driver who complained about the company’s wages. The videotape went viral and was followed by more negative press and a slew of executive departures. Also in February, the company was slammed with a massive trade-secrets lawsuit from its competitor in self-driving cars, Waymo. Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google’s parent company, charged Uber and a former Google employee of stealing 14,000 documents detailing Waymo’s proprietary technology. Waymo has requested that a judge temporarily block Uber’s self-driving program for the duration of the lawsuit. Kalanick seemed to acknowledge the gravity of the growing crisis in a recent letter to the staff. “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” he wrote. “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” Tags:  Technology Transit Uber The Washington Post Subscribe Today!

In a move echoing a similar settlement with Apple in December 2015, Italy’s tax agency said the payment settled Google’s liabilities between 2009 and 2013, the period under investigation by Italy’s Financial Police (GdF) coordinated by the chief public prosecutor in Milan. The settlement also puts an end to separate disputes covering the periods of 2002-2006 and 2014-2015.”We have also begun the process of drawing up an agreement that will ensure Google pays the correct taxes in Italy in the future,” the tax agency said in a statement. “The agency confirms its commitment to pursue fiscal controls on the activities of web-based multinationals in Italy.”Google confirmed it had reached an agreement with the authorities without commenting on whether it accepted the revenue’s calculations. The company has defended the legality of channelling European earnings through its base in Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union. “Google and the Italian Revenue Agency have reached a settlement, resolving a tax inquiry for a period between 2002 and 2015 without litigation,” a spokesman said.”In addition to the corporation tax already paid in Italy for these years, Google will pay an additional 306 million euros. “Of this, over 303 million has been attributed to Google Italy and less than 3 million attributed to Google Ireland. We remain committed to Italy and will continue to help grow the online ecosystem.”  Amazon next in line?  Apple paid 318 million euros at the end of 2015 to settle a dispute over Italian earnings dating back to 2008. Reports at the time said the payment was a discounted settlement of over 800 million euros of unpaid corporation tax, one of several disputes arising from a US multinational basing European operations in Ireland.Local media reports say Amazon is next in the Italian tax agency’s firing line. The Milan prosecutor was reportedly handed a file last week which says the American online retailer owes 130 million euros. That dispute is related to the company’s channelling earnings through Luxembourg. Amazon has defended its returns in Italy, saying its heavy investments in the country explain its low profits and therefore its tax bill.The tax affairs of multinationals in increasingly open developed economies have come under intense scrutiny in recent years. At a time of widespread fiscal austerity in Europe, controversy has mounted over cross-border corporations that “shop around” between different countries for the most advantageous deals, sometimes resulting in secret and potentially illegal “sweetheart” arrangements.American lawmakers, meanwhile, are demanding that US-based multinationals repatriate more of their profits and pay taxes on them. The companies insist that they are operating within the law: Apple chief executive Tim Cook memorably termed the notion of his company stashing cash overseas as “political crap”. -AFP basil RELATED ARTICLES Entertainment Erykah Badu plots international tour Entertainment New single on the way from Miley Cyrus Africa Mozambique’s opposition extends truce as step to end war International business Car supplier Bosch warns against nationalism in Europe International business Shell quarterly profits surge on rebounding oil prices NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The Raspberry Pi Zero is unquestionably the most versatile piece of tech ever devised. Enterprising hobbyists have used it to make robots, games consoles, art installations - Raspberry Pis have even gone into space! We’ve rounded up all the best things you can do with a Raspberry Pi to give budding makers some ideas. Most of these are designed with the larger old-school models in mind, but many of them can be adapted (or even improved) to feature the Raspberry Pi Zero. Below we take a look at some of our favourite Raspberry Pi projects to date:   Build your own AI assistant Google has partnered with official Raspberry Pi magazine The MagPi to release a brand new add-on board, enabling makers to add voice control and artificial intelligence to their Raspberry Pi projects. The board allows hobbyists to make easy use of Google's Cloud Speech API for voice recognition, as well as the Google Assistant SDK that provides the AI brain for the company's smartest devices. Issue 57 of the MagPi comes complete with a free AI kit, including the new Voice HAT add-on module, a speaker, microphone, cables, button and even an enclosure to put it in - everything you'll need to make a homebrew version of Google Home. Networking printers with Raspberry Pi Having a networked printer that can be accessed wirelessly can do wonders for productivity when deployed in a small office. However, outfitting your workplace with network printers can be costly, especially if you've already got perfectly good, non-network printers already in place. This project allow you to have the best of both worlds, using a Raspberry Pi to turn your regular old printer into a connected 'smart' printer. It'll involve a bit of software know-how - you'll need to set up CUPS and SAMBA, for example - but there's no coding or soldering required. This is an excellent project for anyone looking to give their old printing hardware a new lease of life. A full step-by-step guide is available on PiMyLifeUp. The best-looking retro arcade machine ever? Pi-powered retro gaming machines are hardly anything new, but this one has to take the cake as one of the most impressive examples we've seen. Complete with a smooth wooden housing and sleek acrylic inlays, this is decidedly more attractive than the 3D-printed examples one usually sees online. This is definitely not one that most people can do at home, however. Engineer and maker David Johnson crafted this elegant little number using advanced tools like a CNC mill, with circuit boards he made himself. Johnson documented the whole process on YouTube, and while most people are unlikely to be able to follow along at home, it's undeniably impressive to watch. MintyPi 2.0: a GameBoy Advance in an Altoids tin In the grand tradition of cramming a Raspberry Pi into things to make retro gaming machines, enterprising maker Warner Skoch has managed to create a portable games device out of a Raspberry Pi Zero and an Altoids tin. It's actually the second iteration of the project, utilising a slightly bigger screen than the original, as well as including 3D-printed bezels to keep all the electronics tucked away and hinge to hold the lid open while playing. Skoch says he'll release a full step-by-step tutorial in the coming weeks, but if you just can't wait that long and you've got some experience with projects like this, he's outlined the parts he used in this forum thread. Virtual Desktop for Raspberry Pi Thanks to RealVNC's partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the latest versions of the Raspbian distro all include pre-installed versions of VNC Server and VNC Viewer. This can be used to create a virtual desktop, which is excellent for providing a graphical desktop interface to Pis that wouldn't otherwise have one, such as headless devices running IoT or robotics projects. To activate this, first ensure that VNC Server is set up and enabled on the target Raspberry Pi - you can find out how to do that here. Then, use either your Raspberry Pi's terminal or an SSH connection to run the 'vncserver' command. Note down the IP address and display number that VNC Server shows, and input that information into VNC Viewer. After that, you should be free to remotely operate the Pi as if it had a full graphical desktop. Stratux Raspberry Pi is the heart of hundreds of useful projects, but as this gadget shows, it can also help you satisfy your idle curiosity, too. Stratux is a project devised to tell you information about the various aircraft in the sky around you, and it’s wonderfully simply to build. By receiving and translating the ADS-B broadcasts from airplanes in the sky nearby, Stratux gives you information such as the planes’ altitudes, speeds, locations and callsigns. It runs on the Raspberry Pi 3 Motherboard, and the decoding software can be downloaded onto a Micro SD card that you simply slot into the chip. This page has a few alternative lists of parts, ranging in cost from a budget $US95, to a common $US145 package, up to a $US260 list that’s quick to build. Xbox Zero The Raspberry Pi Zero is so small that it could fit into just about anything, as this hack demonstrates. Programmer and maker Terence Eden was lucky enough to get his hands on one of the devices, and with a bit of tinkering, was able to put it inside an original Xbox controller. Using the RetroPie emulation software, he was able to make a retro games console that's entirely contained in the controller. The controller itself loops back into the Pi, so all you need to play your favourite old-school games is an HDMI display and a power source. There's even enough space to fit in a portable power pack for those that want to take it out and about. Terence's blog post with a full how-to is available here.  Tea-Pi A quarter-finalist in the 2014 Hackaday Prize, this project by James Pavur is designed to automate the process of making a nice loose-leaf cuppa. Tell the Raspberry Pi for how long and at what temperature you want your tea brewed, and the Pi will activate the connected kettle, measure the temperature, and lower the tea in with a servo motor.  Once the tea leaves have been in for the desired time, it’ll lift them out again, ready to be made into a lovely cup of tea. Raspberry Tor Router Anonymising network Tor is beloved of privacy advocates everywhere, as well as Dark Web users with more nefarious purposes in mind.  This project turns the Raspberry Pi into a router to send all your network traffic through Tor, rather than just browser sessions. Best of all, you can even slap a battery pack into it to take it wherever you go! Related Articles Raspberry Pi users can get free AI with this Google giveaway What comes next after the Raspberry Pi?

What are the best ways to get customers to know about your business, contact you, or make a purchase? Here are some marketing strategies that work for small businesses. 6. Claim your place on Google Places. Google places listings aren’t just for fast food establishments or retail stores. You can search for any type of service by location, and Google will show a list of companies that match the service you searched for in the location you specified. If you live in a big city, there’s no guarantee your places profile will show up on that first page listing. But having a profile gives you an edge. 7. Look for social media discussions groups that attract your target customers. Depending on what you sell, look for topic-specific groups and/or location-based discussion groups. Set aside a few minutes a day to read the conversations, and then join in when appropriate, making informative comments or posting useful resources. If you don’t have time to do this, hire a freelancer or an employee to help by scouting out conversations that you may want to participate in. 8. Write informative articles related to the service you provide. Put some of the articles on your own site, and distribute others to articles sites and to other sites that reach your audience and use contributors’ articles. Be sure to include an “about the author” resources box with a link to your website. The articles will help get yourself and your company known, and help establish your credibility. 9. Print up flyers or brochures and distribute them at membership groups you belong to, if allowed. Print small quantities of flyers or product sheets yourself on a color printer. (Be sure to use good quality paper – something heavier than standard copier paper.) When you know you’ll need a hundred or more copies at a time, compare the cost of having them printed to the cost of printing your own. Be sure to allow enough time to have the printing delivered to you. 10. Volunteer to speak at local business groups. Local business groups always need interesting speakers to attract members to meetings. Your talk should be about some area of your specialty, but should focus on the audience’s informational needs and the problems they want to solve. 11. Submit proposals to speak at industry group conferences. If you don’t have a lot of experience speaking, see if you can get on a panel, instead of giving a solo speech. Be sure to promote your participation in the panel before the event, and link to any videos or other after-event promo the conference planner has posted. 12. Refer business to other businesses in your networks. Giving referrals is as important a networking tool as getting them. People recommend people they like and business people usually like other business people who send them business. 13. Tweet, mention and link to blog posts and social networking posts made by other individuals if what they’ve written something of interest to your audience. Besides providing good material for your followers, it’s a good way to win social media friends, expand your network, and get your name and specialty known. 14. Build an email list and send informative mailings to it on a regular basis. Your mailing list should be made up of people who have asked to be on it. (Having a newsletter signup box on your web page is one good way to get people to “ask” to be on your mailing list.) 15. Join and participate in local business groups and try one or two leads groups as well. The best source of business for many small service businesses is referrals. 16. Stick with groups that attract the types of people you want as customers. Even when people don’t really know you, you become a more trusted resource just by showing up. 17. Keep in touch with potential customers and existing customers with a postcard mailing. The person who doesn’t have time to talk to you today, may need your services (or know someone else who does) a month or 6 months from now. 18. Ask for referrals. Besides asking existing clients if they know anyone else who can use your services, consider what other professionals you know who could refer business to you – and vice versa. If you’re an electrician, talk to local builders and remodeling contractors, plumbers, and people who lay tile. If you are a graphic designer talk to web designers and ad agencies about referring work. 19. Pick up the phone and call likely prospects. Cold calling is hard and you have to be able to deal with rejection. But it does work. If you are fearful about trying it, I really recommend to hit me up for a chit-chat. 20. Don’t be too quick to discourage tire kickers. It’s hard to know where to draw the line with people who keep asking questions without any indication they plan to make a purchase, but sometimes those questions are used as much to size you or your business up as they are to gain information. 21. Have a website and publicize it. It amazes me, but there are still businesses that don’t have a website. I was at a Chamber of Commerce meeting a few months ago and met someone who said he was a copywriter. I asked for a business card, and his card didn’t include his website, so I asked for his website URL. Amazingly, the person who had just tried to convince me he could write copy for the web, didn’t have a website. No matter how much in-person networking you do or how much social media networking you do, you still need a website. Your prospects will want to see samples of your work, get more information about you, and if you’re a consultant or other expert, they’re probably going to want to read things you’ve written about your area of expertise. You can control what they see on your own website. You can’t control what ads show up next to your posts or what the rules are on social media sites. If you can’t afford to pay a web developer, set up at least a simple website using free or low cost website hosting and design tools such as Weebly or GoDaddy. Once you have a website, be sure it’s listed on all your sales literature, your business card, association member directories, and as many places as you can get listings. 23. Have a fully functioning website. Another circumstance I find amazing is the number of small businesses who join local business networking groups and have non-working websites listed in the group’s membership directory. Occasionally it’s because the directory listing was published with a typo in the domain name. But often, it appears the business that owned the domain name let it lapse – or never finished setting up the website. Don’t let that happen to you. Be sure you register the domain name yourself (instead of letting the web developer do it), and be sure that you keep your credit card information up-to-date at the domain registrar. Double check your association directory listing after it’s published to be sure there are no typos and the link works. Check each page on your site to be sure you didn’t leave up any links going to blank pages or to “under construction pages.” 24. Don’t stop marketing. Once business starts coming in on a regular basis it’s tempting to ease off on some of the marketing and networking you do. But that’s a mistake. You need to market continually to keep business coming in regularly.

The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided “material support” to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. “For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,” family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in the US District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook’s co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on December 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old US-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. A file photo provided by US Customs and Border Protection shows Tashfeen Malik (left) and her husband, Syed Farook, at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Farook and Malik opened fire on a meeting of Farook's colleagues, and were killed in a shootout with police in San Bernardino. (AP) Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on US soil since the September 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016, the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases. tags San Bernardino Facebook Google Twitter California more from world Family says booted off Delta flight over child’s seat, airlines apologises May 05, 2017 08:44 IST US wants info on social media accounts, email-id from some visa applicants May 05, 2017 01:28 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

The investigation is in its early stages, but deepens the crisis for the embattled company and its chief executive and founder Travis Kalanick, who has faced a barrage of negative press this year in the wake of high-profile sexual harassment complaints, a slew of high-level executive departures, and a consequential trade secrets lawsuit from Google’s parent company. Uber Hong Kong sees bumpy ride on long road to acceptance The federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters, focuses on software developed by Uber called “Greyball.” The program helped the company evade officials in cities where Uber was not yet approved. The software identified and blocked rides to transportation regulators who were posing as Uber customers in an effort to prove that the company was operating illegally. Uber declined to comment on the criminal investigation. The Department of Justice declined to comment, citing its practice of not confirming or denying possible investigations. In a letter last week to Portland, Oregon, authorities, who had requested information about the program as part of a civil probe, Uber said greyballing refers to the practice of showing some customers a different version of the app than most customers see. Uber’s attorneys said the program was used “exceedingly sparingly” in Portland, and that the company had not used it since April 2015, when Portland adopted preliminary rules allowing Uber to operate. Hong Kong Uber drivers defiant in the face of government crackdown Uber, which is valued privately by investors at close to US$70 billion, has a reputation among Silicon Valley companies for a hard-charging workplace culture that is driven by Kalanick himself. The 40-year-old is known as a quick-tempered and combative manager who aims to win at all costs and inspires fierce loyalty in his inner circle. In its earlier years, the company employed cutthroat tactics against its competitor Lyft. At one point, Uber employees would summon Lyft drivers and then cancel rides. Kalanick once bragged about a feature, called “God View,” which it used to track a journalist and other noteworthy individuals. He has charged into legal battles with transportation regulators and taxi drivers in cities across the world. Until recently, Uber emerged from its many controversies relatively unscathed. It had been on a rocket-ship trajectory, raising more than US$12 billion in venture capital, poaching executive talent from Google, and setting up shop in hundreds of cities. Five Hong Kong Uber drivers lodge appeals following conviction for driving without permit But a series of crises this year have rocked the company and shaken Kalanick to his core, according to people who know him. In February, a female engineer wrote a blog post about a traumatising experience of sexual harassment and retaliation from the company’s human resources department. After the post went viral, Kalanick apologised and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the allegations. The crises continued when, later that month, Kalanick was videotaped verbally attacking an Uber driver who complained about the company’s wages. The videotape also went viral, and was followed by more negative press and a slew of executive departures. Also in February, the company was slammed with a massive trade secrets lawsuit from its competitor in self-driving cars, Waymo. Waymo, which is the self-driving car division of Google’s parent company, charged Uber and a former Google employee of stealing 14,000 documents detailing Waymo’s proprietary technology. Waymo has requested that a judge temporarily block Uber’s self-driving program for the duration of the lawsuit. Kalanick seemed to acknowledge the gravity of the growing crisis in a recent letter to the staff. “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” he wrote. “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” SCMP Today: Intl Edition Get updates direct to your inbox.

Kalanick seemed to acknowledge the gravity of the growing crisis in a recent letter to the staff. “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” he wrote. “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Nation Suggested Stories: Hyundai replaces General Motors as NFL auto sponsor – Jun 29, 2015 California: Self-driving cars must have driver behind wheel – Dec 16, 2015 San Francisco battles epidemic of auto burglaries – Jun 13, 2016 Police: Colts' David Parry arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona – Feb 28, 2017 Advertisement Load comments Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided “material support” to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino.   “For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,” family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook’s co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

No business should ever be held liable for a customer’s misuse of its products or services. Not only would that be patently unjust, it would set a precedent that could lead to a deluge of even more ridiculous lawsuits. After all, where would the line be drawn? Next you’d hear about people suing breweries and auto manufacturers for drunk driving deaths, or suing ladder manufacturers when people fall off roofs. Individuals and groups should only be liable for matters that are truly within their control. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Among Republicans, 72% trusted “Trump’s White House” over (or more than) “National Political Media,” and 10% trusted the media over Trump, and that’s a ratio of 7.2 to 1 trusting Trump over the media. Among Democrats, however, 54% trusted media over Trump, and 12% trusted Trump over media, and that’s a ratio of 4.5 to 1 trusting media over Trump. So: Democrats there were far more trusting of the media than were Republicans.  The big turning-point on the trust of U.S. ‘news’ media was 2003. Americans had trusted the media not to be mere stenographers for the George W. Bush White House back before we invaded and wrecked Iraq on 20 March of that year, and Americans gradually discovered that the media instead had been mere stenographers, not authentic journalists at all — not journalists in any genuinely democratic country. (In any country where the newsmedia can’t reasonably be trusted, and this must include any stenographic press, no real democracy is even possible.) Other studies have shown that Republicans trust Fox News and other Republican Party organs the most as ‘news’media, and that Democrats trust CNN and other Democratic Party organs the most as ‘news’media. Practically everyone seeks ‘news’ that ‘confirms’ his/her particular political myths. And Gallup has found that during 1997 to 2005, Democrats’ “Trust in Mass Media” gradually rose from around 60% in 1997, to a peak of 70% in 2005, as Democrats’ suspicions of the Republican White House after Bush’s invasion of Iraq soared when no WMD were found there and the ‘news’ media were by now blaming the ‘errors’ upon allegedly ‘faulty intelligence’, instead of upon America’s real dictatorship — the actual regime in power and its stenographic ‘news’ media. From 2005 till now, that 70% figure among Democrats has declined to 51%, as increasing numbers of Democrats come to recognize that we live in a dictatorship. Meanwhile, Republicans during the period 1997 to the start of 2003, trusted the “Mass Media” at percentages ranging in the 40s, but this figure suddenly plunged down to 31% after the invasion of Iraq when the ‘news’ reports from Iraq disconfirmed all of the Republican regime’s allegations — Republicans distrusted the press the more, as the truth started to be reported the more. By the start of 2015, those Republican percentages were still around 31%, and Republicans were still trusting the most, the Republican news network Fox News, which had cheer-led Bush’s invasion of Iraq. But then, on 14 September 2016, Gallup headlined “Americans’ Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low”, and reported that the main reason for the new low was that now only a record low of 14% of Republicans still trusted the “Mass Media.” It had plunged more than half since the prior year’s 32% figure for Republicans. And, at that same time, 51% of Democrats still trusted the “Mass Media,” which was a record-low percentage for Democrats too, but still remained higher than every Republican percentage for trusting the media except for the 52% Republican trust in the “Mass Media” back in 1998, when the Democrats’ Lewinsky affair and impeachment of Bill Clinton dominated the ’news’.  In other words: people trust the media if and to the extent that the media are confirming their suspicions. American politics is two imaginary ‘realities’, both controlled by the same aristocracy: the Republicans’ ‘reality’, and the Democrats’ ‘reality’ — and both ‘realities’ are dominated by the same lies, but different bumper-stickers representing them. (These shared bipartisan lies are the falsehoods that are essential to supporting the entire oligarchy, and they mainly concern international relations.) Trust in the ‘news’ media is sinking, but remains unrealistically high, unrealistic especially amongst Democrats (since they still overwhelmingly trust the ‘news’); and this trust is the chief thing that keeps the U.S. regime — both the “Democratic” and the “Republican” wings of it — in power, as a two-Party dictatorship, both of whose Parties represent the same aristocracy. During the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaigns, it was clear to any intelligent American that neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton was at all trustworthy, and so the country split even more sharply than before along purely partisan lines. There was really nothing else for voters to go on; it was just a selection between two competing psychopaths. Not voting at all in such an ‘election’ is to allow all other voters to make the choice instead; and this can be an efficient thing to do in such a desperate situation, if both of the psychopaths are approximately of equivalent evil — just letting everyone else do the ‘coin-tosses’. The least intelligent Americans chose instead the inefficient way to allow everyone but oneself to make this political choice: these were the voters who cast ‘protest’ votes for third-party candidates whose only real participation in the contest was to draw off more voters from one major-Party candidate than from the other and so to throw the ‘election’ to the one whose lying rhetoric sounded the more different from that given third-party candidate’s political rhetoric. This ‘symbolic’ act (third-party voting) was merely enhancing the prospects that a minor-party candidate could become a ‘kingmaker’ between the two real candidates, and thus adding still further to the pervasive corruption. It happened with Nader in 2000 (who was crucially funded by major Republican donors), but that was the only successful recent third-party Presidential candidacy up till then — Bush v. Gore would never even have been possible, and both Florida and New Hampshire would have incontestably gone to Gore, if Nader hadn’t thrown that ‘election’ from Gore to Bush, but Nader was the only recent successful “spoiler.”  In an oligarchy, public politics is always a choice between two evils (not really more than that). It’s an attempt to select the lesser evil. What protects the oligarchs the most, is whatever sustains the lie that the nation is (or that it remains) a democracy — in other words: the longer that the myth of there being (or still being) a democracy can be sustained among the public, the safer the oligarchy will be. Maintaining this lie is maintaining the existing dictatorship. However, it’s not only the ‘news’media that serve this essential function for the aristocracy. For example, Google, now officially known as “Alphabet Inc.,” is a major determinant of the ‘news’ that the public receives from web-searches; and in order for Google to be able to shift blame onto “an error by one of our contractors” whenever an online site that Google wants to bury discovers that Google has been hiding the given site from the public, Google has selected contractors who understand the objectives of the people who control Google; and, when those contractors then suppress a site, they cite the best-sounding excuse they can, so that the company that’s paying them, Google, will always have some excuse for its (contracted-out) censorship, and can always override the contractor’s decision as having been a mere ‘mistake’ if ever the suppressed site is already big enough to be able publicly to embarrass Google for having censored it out. Thus, for example, as “Business Insider,” one of the aristocracy’s ‘news’media explains it, “A vendor hired by Google employs contractors to rate the websites that appear in its search results — the rating is used to improve search quality, helping Google’s automated search algorithm prioritize higher-rated, reliable information.” And, after the large anti-Establishment InfoWars site complained, “Google said Monday that a vendor mistakenly told staffers working for the search engine that InfoWars should be ranked as a low-quality site.” In other words: the censorship then can be described as having been a “mistake.” (But, of course, the contractor doesn’t usually get fired for a ‘mistake’ — unless it really was that, which rarely is the case.) And, so, “Google’s representative distanced the company from the contractor’s instructions, telling Business Insider that it does not instruct quality raters how to grade specific websites.” “Quality raters” — as if Google really cares about quality, instead of about its own bottom-line, which depends not upon quality, but upon satisfying the rest of the aristocracy (which means to provide low quality, deceiving the public in the ways that the aristocrats want). More commonly, Google’s “quality raters” target little-known, truly independent, sites, which have no allegiance to any Party but only to truth. (Some people care about truth, no matter how unprofitable it might be.) For example, when Google threatened one of my publishers, RINF, it was over a specific article, which Google (probably actually one of their “contractors”) demanded the site to remove. The site refused to remove it. No issue of “quality” was even involved, merely a demand, and an implicit threat. The site’s owner ultimately decided that he’d rather just quit than participate in Google’s censorship of the web; and so he instead chose to ignore the threat. These are small sites, anyway; so, almost everyone who goes there is a repeat visitor, and becoming rich isn’t such a site-owner’s chief objective. These are individuals who really do care about democracy, and this means also about truth. Incidentally, Google was deeply committed to Hillary Clinton’s becoming America’s President, and also participated importantly in her State Department’s successful coup in Ukraine, and in its (as-yet-unsuccessful) effort to overthrow Syria’s Russia-and-Iran-allied government and replace it with one that allies instead with the owners of Saudi Arabia and of Qatar, and with their allied governments, which control the U.S. and Israel.   So, international affairs are a rich thicket of deceptions, and of power; and the largest international corporations are intimately involved in it. Trump’s voters thought that he would resist that, but instead his international policies (and also many of his domestic policies) seem to be just continuing those of his predecessor, whose international policies he had intensely condemned. Mass-deception is at the basis of this ‘democracy’. But it’s not only the media, and it’s not only the government; it is the whole corrupt system, and especially the coterie of perhaps as few as a hundred people (perhaps most of which are hidden from the public, and there is no guess here as to whom are at the very top) who collectively control it.  The higher one gets, the darker it gets, but this is the only thing that’s clear, about the system. The ‘news’media serve that system, and cast any light they shed, only downward from it — below and away from it, where the stage is, not where the scriptwriters and directors and producers are, which can be very different places.  It’s all just a show, even if it’s not an entertaining one. It’s where the public are, split into various prejudices, and the prejudices that are their opposites. It’s organized truth-evasion, on ‘both’ sides.

Courtesy file photos SAN BERNARDINO >> Lack of oversight by Facebook, Google and Twitter is responsible for the terrorist attack that left 14 people dead and wounded 22 others Dec. 2, 2015, in San Bernardino, alleges a lawsuit on behalf of the families of three victims. The lawsuit follows a template that the attorneys used for similar lawsuits suing the tech giants for attacks in Orlando, Dallas and Paris. “For years, defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits,” write Keith L. Altman of Michigan-based 1-800-LawFirm and Theida Salazar of Burbank-based Salazar Law Group. “...Without defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible.” The lawsuit was filed Wednesday on behalf of the families of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos. Salazar represents the Clayborn and Nguyen families in a separate lawsuit against the county, state and Inland Regional Center — where the mass shooting took place — alleging that better security and other procedures could have stopped the attack. That suit will expand to include the Thalosinos family, Salazar said Thursday. Altman has lawsuits in early stages against the same companies on behalf of victims of other attacks. Attorneys for the three companies argued in court documents related to the Pulse night club shooting in Orlando that the Communications Decency Act bars the families from suing them and that they are not publishers. They also argue that the Orlando attack was domestic — not international — terrorism. Of the three companies, only Facebook responded Thursday to an email regarding the San Bernardino lawsuit. “We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook,” the statement says. “There is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us. We sympathize with the victims and their families.” In an online report, Twitter says it has suspended 636,248 accounts for violations related to the spread of terrorism in the period of August 1, 2015, through December 31, 2016. Only 2 percent of those were reported by the government, while 74 percent were caught by Twitter’s internal tools, it said. But the lawsuit alleges the companies have failed to take simple actions that could dramatically reduce the number of terrorism-promoting accounts. ISIS had an estimated 70,000 Twitter accounts, at least 79 of which were “official,” as of December 2014, posting at least 90 tweets per minute, according to the lawsuit. Advertisement Accounts that are shut down return in predictable ways, Altman said. For instance, the pro-ISIS group Asawitiri Media has had 335 accounts, the lawsuit says, citing the New York Times. When @TurMedia333 was shut down, it started @TurMedia334. When that was shut down, it started @TurMedia335. All of them reportedly had the same profile picture — a photograph of a bearded man. Software could easily detect that sort of duplication, or could flag new accounts that suddenly try to follow thousands of others — especially when those accounts have been following previous ISIS accounts, according to Altman. “I’m trying to be practical here,” Altman said by phone Thursday. “An extreme position would be that Facebook, Twitter and Google should review every message. That would end Facebook, Twitter and Google. ... There are techniques that could exclude legitimate activities and get rid of 95 percent of these (terrorist) accounts. That could save a lot of lives.” The accounts tend to be relatively easy to find by design, Altman said, or else potential recruits couldn’t find them. FBI Director James Comey testified that the terrorists, San Bernardino County employee Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik, were “consuming poison on the internet.” The attorneys intend to prove that three companies could have stopped them from accessing that poison, Altman said. While the lawsuits seek monetary damages, the main goal is to stop future attacks, he said. “People ask, ‘What do these people want?’ ” Altman said. “What these people want are no more funerals. They don’t want to see people bury their loved ones, their brothers, their parents. That’s what they want.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Ryan Hagen covers the city of San Bernardino for The Sun.

Live Watch San Bernardino victims' families file lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook, Google By COURTNEY CONNLEY May 4, 2017, 10:28 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayLA Times/Getty Images WATCH The Attack: The Heroes of San Bernardino Part 1 0 Shares Email The families of the victims of the 2015 San Bernardino, California, mass shooting filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against Twitter, Facebook and Google, accusing the companies of knowingly supporting ISIS. According to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on behalf of their attorneys, the families of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos, all of whom were killed in the terror attack, claim the two social media platforms and one search engine provide the terrorist group with support and a platform to grow. "For years, Defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits," the families said in the lawsuit. "Defendants are information content providers because they create unique content by combining ISIS postings with advertisements in a way that is specifically targeted at the viewer." On Dec. 2, 2015, 14 people were killed at Inland Regional Center when heavily armed gunmen who were "on a mission" opened fire at the center, a facility that provides services to people with developmental disabilities. The perpetrators, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, died in a shootout with police hours after the attack. Sources told ABC News at the time that Malik, who used an alias on social media, allegedly pledged her allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, ahead of the shooting spree. Investigators search for motive as San Bernardino shooting deemed an 'act of terrorism' 2 San Bernardino shooting suspects identified after being killed in shootout, police say In their lawsuit against the social media sites, the families of the San Bernardino victims say that Facebook, Twitter and Google have acted as a supporting tool for ISIS to "attract new recruits and inspire lone actor attacks." The families highlight an ISIS recruitment video that was posted on social media in June 2014. While YouTube removed the video, the lawsuit points out that a Twitter link remained available for download and was promoted through re-tweets by ISIS-related accounts. In addition to a recruitment video, a Twitter page was made for Al-Furqan, ISIS's media wing responsible for producing multimedia propaganda. The lawsuit noted that Al-Furqan's Twitter followers "have grown at an astonishing rate," and says Al-Furqan has used the platform to post "messages from ISIS leadership as well as videos and images of beheadings and other brutal forms of executions." As of December 2014, ISIS has had an estimated 70,000 Twitter accounts and posted at least 90 tweets every minute, according to the lawsuit. The families also claim that the terrorist group has used Google and Facebook in a similar manner and says that the advertising revenue Google earns is shared with ISIS. In response to the lawsuit, Facebook told ABC News in a statement, "We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook. There is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us. We sympathize with the victims and their families." Twitter responded to the lawsuit by directing ABC News to a statement on its Twitter Rules page which states that the platform clearly prohibits threats of violence or the promotion of terrorism, and pointed to data in their latest Transparency Report that reveals from July 1, 2016, to Dec. 31, 2016, a total of 376,890 accounts were suspended for violations related to promotion of terrorism. Twitter also referenced a similar lawsuit they won in 2016 that linked them to providing support to ISIS. Google did not respond to ABC News request for a statement, but according to YouTube's website, the platform "strictly prohibits content intended to recruit for terrorist organizations, incite violence, celebrate terrorist attacks or otherwise promote acts of terrorism." ABC News' Alex Stone and Julie Sone contributed to this report. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " San Bernardino victims' families sue Twitter, Facebook, Google " Trump says Obamacare 'dead' after GOP health bill passes House " Mexican-Americans torn about Cinco de Mayo in Trump era " Officer who fatally shot teen had once been suspended " Trump touts universal health care with Australian PM " State Dept. deletes retweet promoting Ivanka Trump’s book " Protesters line up in NYC, hoping for chance to boo Trump " Trump admin. takes a step toward 'extreme vetting' with rule targeting social media accounts " US intercepts Russian bombers and fighters near Alaska " GOP-led House panel votes to overhaul Dodd-Frank " Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman returns to court in drug case " Heartbroken boy receives 'do-over' birthday party from strangers " Teen with cerebral palsy gets to meet the Yankees " Nurse saves unconscious man on way to her bridal shower " Hero police officer reunites with boy he saved from drowning " Meet the real-life Darth Vader who lives in Tennessee " Twin sisters give birth to baby boys on same day in same hospital " Sock business is booming for man with Down syndrome " Vet serenades puppy before surgery " 5th-grader to be honored for 5 years of perfect attendance " TSA warns against vehicle-ramming attacks " N.

Hundreds of vacationers looking for a famous Norwegian cliff formation can attest to that fact, after being sent to a village 30km away. The stunning Preikestolen cliff formation, also known as Pulpit Rock, attracts thousands of tourists each year – but those seeking the landmark may want to rely on an old-fashioned paper atlas instead of Google Maps.  Otherwise, they may end up on a winding detour which lands them in the tiny village of Fossmork, 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) away from their intended destination. That’s the fate that hundreds of tourists have already encountered. Read more Google Maps puts Marine Le Pen in presidential Elysee Palace (IMAGES) “We have sent hundreds of tourists away in no uncertainty that they’re on the wrong side of the fjord. In the summer season up to 10-15 cars show up each day,” Fossmork resident Helge Fossmark told Norwegian newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad.  He added that there are often queues of minibuses lining up outside the village on summer days. As if the detour itself wasn’t bad enough, the winding road getting to the village has been described as “terrible” by the Norwegian daily. Another resident, Gunnar Bøe, said tourists are often angry once he tells them they’ve been led astray, partly due to the narrow road. “When we are in the cabin, sometimes two, three, four or five tourists come in. Every day. They say they are going to Preikestolen and understand nothing. Google Maps leads them over the Lysefjord bridge and into Fossmork. The road here is quite narrow and they sometimes get quite upset when we tell them to go back,” he said. He said he lends them a set of binoculars to catch a peek at the people on the actual cliff formation, which can be seen from the village. “It's quite funny. We get to speak with Chinese and Japanese people, and there was an American that wanted to buy a cabin. He thought the place was fantastic,” Bøe said. Read more Google Maps & local utilities team up to fight methane leaks Roy Jarle Johansen of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration has vowed to look into the issue, according to Aftenposten newspaper.  “I think we should make sure people are shown the right direction, when it is such a well-visited place. Roadsigns do not always solve the problem. Some people trust Google more,” he said. Meanwhile, Google Norway employee Helle Skjervold has welcomed feedback, telling Aftenposten in an email that the company is “constantly working to improve Google Maps, and encourage people to report any problems they find, so that we can make sure we resolve the issue as soon as possible.” Located in western Norway, Preikestolen is a steep cliff which rises 604 meters (1,982 feet) above a fjord known as Lysefjorden. The formation attracted between 150,000 and 200,000 visitors in 2012, making it one of the most visited natural tourist attractions in the country. The Norwegian mix-up wasn’t the first mistake to be made by Google Maps. Just last month, the service confused an Australian man’s home in Darwin with a pop-up pizzeria in a nearby park. The wrong information led to a string of unwanted customers – and even a person seeking a job – at his doorstep, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

An affordable and very versatile platform allows tons of creativity and possibilities in molding your own gadgets. Now Google is making the RasPi a little smarter. The new edition of the official Raspberry Pi magazine MagPi includes a new type of accessory for the Raspberry Pi which lets you integrate Google's Assistant to your creation. In essence it's a piece of technology from Google Home that can be inserted into a Raspberry Pi 3, Pi Zero or Pi 2. Obviously in addition to the actual Voice HAT, which stands for Hardware Accessory on Top, board the addon includes a speaker and a microphone for both delivering the voice commands as well as hearing the responses. You also get all the necessary wires. The companies have coined a term Artificial Intelligence Yourself, or AIY, that describes the aim to make AI more accessible to hobbyist and homebrew software creators. Unfortunately at this point the Voice HAT is only available with the MagPi magazine, and is sold out, but Raspberry Pi has told Wired that it might release it separately. That would seem smart, at least after the HAT has done its job and attracted more subscribers.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Updated 3 hours ago The Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into Uber's use of a secret software that was used to evade authorities in places where its ride-hailing service was banned or restricted, according to a person familiar with the government's probe. The investigation is in its early stages but deepens the crisis for the embattled company and its chief executive and founder Travis Kalanick, who has faced a barrage of negative press this year over high-profile sexual harassment complaints, a slew of high-level executive departures and a consequential trade secrets lawsuit from Google's parent company. The federal criminal probe, first reported by Reuters, focuses on software developed by Uber called “Greyball.” The program helped the company evade officials in cities where Uber was not yet approved. The software identified and blocked rides to transportation regulators who were posing as Uber customers in an effort to prove that the company was operating illegally. Uber declined to comment on the criminal investigation. The Department of Justice declined to comment, citing its practice of not confirming or denying possible investigations. In a letter last week to Portland, Ore., authorities, who had requested information about the program as part of a civil probe, Uber said greyballing refers to the practice of showing some customers a different version of the app than most customers see. Uber's attorneys said the program was used “exceedingly sparingly” in Portland and that the company had not used it since April 2015, when Portland adopted preliminary rules allowing Uber to operate. Uber, which is valued privately by investors at close to $70 billion, has a reputation among Silicon Valley companies for a hard-charging workplace culture driven by Kalanick. The 40-year-old is known as a quick-tempered and combative manager who aims to win-at-all costs and inspires fierce loyalty in his inner circle. In its earlier years, the company employed cutthroat tactics against its competitor Lyft. At one point, Uber employees would summon Lyft drivers and then cancel rides. Kalanick once bragged about a feature, called “God View,” which it used to track a journalist and other noteworthy individuals. He has charged into legal battles with transportation regulators and taxi drivers in cities across the world. Until recently, Uber emerged from its many controversies relatively unscathed. It had been on a rocket-ship trajectory, raising more than $12 billion in venture capital, poaching executive talent from Google, and setting up shop in hundreds of cities. But a series of crises this year have rocked the company and shaken Kalanick to his core, according to people who know him. In February, a female engineer wrote a blog post about a traumatizing experience of sexual harassment and retaliation from the company's human resources department. After the post went viral, Kalanick apologized and hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the allegations. The crises continued when, later that month, Kalanick was videotaped verbally attacking an Uber driver who complained about the company's wages. The videotape also went viral, and was followed by more negative press and a slew of executive departures. Also in February, the company was slammed with a trade secrets lawsuit from its competitor in self-driving cars, Waymo. Waymo, which is the self-driving car division of Google's parent company, charged Uber and a former Google employee of stealing 14,000 documents detailing Waymo's proprietary technology. Waymo has requested that a judge temporarily block Uber's self-driving program for the duration of the lawsuit. Kalanick seemed to acknowledge the gravity of the growing crisis in a recent letter to the staff. “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” he wrote. “This is the first time I've been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” More Business UberEATS delivers more competition to Pittsburgh's food delivery scene Plunging oil prices weigh on stocks as other sectors edge up April jobs report expected to be brighter Sheetz opening new stores, hiring 3,400 more workers Aurora Innovation joins Pittsburgh's self-driving car ecosystem TribLIVE commenting policy You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

Recently, there has been a timeline published by Google that shows for how long they will be providing updates for their new Nexus line of Android smartphones. A somewhat subtle update prior to the weekend, it has been revealed that the Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9 will stop receiving security updates by the end of the year, October will be last month to be more precise. The Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X still have guaranteed patches until September 2018. Google has given us information in regards to Operating System updates and when they will stop being released in the past, but the fact that we know when we no longer will be receiving security updates is something new. And apparently, Google will be providing users with two years of update support and only three years support in the shape of security patches, at best. Once that ends, your device will be susceptible to all sort of vulnerabilities as it will no longer be up-to-date. What is worse is that most people do not buy their phones exactly when they get launched. As such, if you purchase your phone one year or a few months prior to the last date when they get updated, you will only benefit from that period of safety for it. After that, you can just as simply lose it to new threats that it has not been updated for. On the completely opposite spectrum, Apple has been continuously updating its iPhone 5 and iPad 4 devices since their release in 2012.  They benefit from the fact that they construct both the software and the hardware, and as such, for each model they release every year it will be much easier to continue supporting them in the future with new updates in both OS and security.

Recently, Google has addressed some security risks for the Android OS that could have compromised the security of the user’s data. For example, one of the vulnerabilities would have allowed someone to remotely gain execution privileges through web browsing, emails or instant messages. Nexus device users will have the update available for them, and Android users can update their devices from Android’s website. OEM will be directing the users to a website so they can update, or will provide them with an over-the-air update. This update came as part of Google’s monthly security update releases, which has addressed a rather broad spectrum of issues for the Android. Notably, there have been six vulnerabilities which risked compromising the OS’s Mediaserver. Potential to remote execute One of the vulnerabilities that have been addressed in regards to the Mediaserver part has been addressed in this update. If left unaddressed, this could have allowed a potential attacker to corrupt the memory when data and files were being processed by the user. Should this happen, the memory corruption would permit the hacker to initialize a remote code execution. GIFLIB library has seen some attention in this update, having fixed a vulnerability which could also permit a code execution to be delivered during processes done via Mediaserver. There was also an issue with the touchscreen driver that has been resolved. There have also been problems fixed in several of the OS’s subsystems, such as the Motorola bootloader, the video driver, the Kernal Sound Subsystem, and a few others. All these had several vulnerabilities which could have permitted an attacker to exploit. There haven’t been any reports of attackers exploiting the users, so it is nice to see that Google has taken the initiative early with this fix. According to them, the chance for an attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities was pretty high.

New Study Documents Wall Street and Telecoms' Impressive Control of Congress Thursday, May 04, 2017 By John Light, Moyers & Company | Report font size decrease font size increase font size Print Tweet An activist raises a sign on a smartphone to protest the proposed stripping of net neutrality in Washington, DC, November 6, 2014. (Photo: Joseph Gruber) Back in 2006, Democrat Ed Markey, then a congressman and now a senator from Massachusetts, introduced an amendment to protect net neutrality, the dull name for the important idea that all internet traffic be treated equally by internet service providers. This legislation, it turned out, was a cash cow for Congress. Large telecommunication companies wanted to prevent Markey's protections from being put in place, since it would constrain their business. Companies like Google and Netflix, on the other hand, wanted to make sure the protections were put in place, since they would protect their business. Without net neutrality protections, the telecommunication companies could regulate how quickly sites like Google and Netflix loaded for their customers -- or whether their customers were able to access the sites at all. A new report from the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, uses the battle that unfolded over this 2006 legislation to illustrate a larger point: That with enough money, companies can buy legislators' votes. To see more stories like this, visit Moyers & Company at Truthout. In this example, of course, party played a big role in how members of Congress voted: Democrats largely supported net neutrality, Republicans largely didn't. The partisan split remains today. But money also played a determining role, the Roosevelt Institute's researchers found. For every $1,000 given by a company like Netflix or Google, the likelihood that a member of Congress would vote for the legislation increased by 24 percent. For every $1,000 given by companies that opposed net neutrality, the chances that a legislator would vote against the legislation increased by 2.6 percent. The amendment failed, though President Barack Obama's Federal Communications Commission later secured net neutrality without Congress' help. (It is, however, now under threat again by President Donald Trump's FCC chair.) The Roosevelt Institute study that came up with this cost-per-vote analysis is one of a kind. It's very hard to track influence, and it only got more difficult to do so after 2010, when new species of nonprofit began to populate the political spending ecosystem in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. Interconnected super PACs, LLCs, party-affiliated groups, think tanks and dark money nonprofits allowed donors to pass limitless and often anonymous sums through a financial labyrinth, making it near-impossible, in some cases, for journalists and citizens to track which special interest was influencing which vote. But, in the new study, political scientists Thomas Ferguson and Paul Jorgensen and statistician Jie Chen have done the work to document how money influences Congress. The authors of this study attempted to take all of the post-Citizens United groups into account -- candidate campaign committees, party committees, dark money groups, SuperPACs and others. In addition to the 2006 vote on net neutrality, the researchers examined how members of Congress voted on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which passed Congress in 2010 and were meant to rein in some of the Wall Street excesses that contributed to the financial crisis. The Democratic Party largely supported Dodd-Frank -- some of its strictest provisions were the handiwork of progressive senators like Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH). But the researchers found that for every $100,000 a House Democrats received from the financial industry, the odds that the legislator in question would break with the party and oppose an aspect of Dodd-Frank increased by 13.9 percent. The researchers also found that the temptation of a spin through the revolving door may have played a role in how members of Congress voted on Dodd-Frank. Legislators who left the House in 2014 were much more likely to side with the banks in their votes, because, the researchers suggest, they were considering where their future paychecks might come from. "Taken as a whole, the pattern [the two case studies] display is too obvious to need much emphasis," the researchers write. "Substantial numbers of legislators sell out the public interest in exchange for political money." Political money also ensures that the politicians favored by corporations have the money they need to campaign hard for reelection and hold onto their office, the researchers write. That may mean that those who retain their seats are more friendly to well-healed interests. Because of the amount of money they have, and their willingness to spend it on political issues that could affect their bottom line, the telecommunications industry and the financial industry are two of the most influential constituencies in Washington -- a fact demonstrated by the never-ending battles over financial regulation and net neutrality, both of which have lobbyists gearing up, once again, in an effort to push a new bushel of corporate favors through Congress and onto Trump's desk in 2017.

KABC By Rob McMillan Thursday, May 04, 2017 08:15PM SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (KABC) -- Some family members of victims of the 2015 San Bernardino terror attacks are suing social media companies, saying they allow terrorist groups to spread propaganda on their platforms. The suit says the companies - Twitter, Google and Facebook - knowingly and recklessly provided social media accounts for terrorist groups to spread propaganda, raise money and attract recruits. "You see so much stuff on social media, that you wonder how that gets on there," said Gregory Clayborn, whose daughter Sierra was killed in the Dec. 2, 2015 attack. "And you say wait a minute isn't somebody monitoring or filtering or managing what gets on and what doesn't?" Clayborn and the family members of two other victims, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos, say social media helped fuel the growth of ISIS and that the terrorist group's use of social media influenced the two San Bernardino shooters. In response to the lawsuit, Facebook gave this statement to Eyewitness News: "There is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it's reported to us." Twitter said in the last six months of 2016, nearly 380,000 accounts were suspended because of terrorist-related violations.

Digital Trends Home > Web > Make a cutesy video for your mom on Mother’s… Make a cutesy video for your mom on Mother’s Day with Google Photos tool By Christian de Looper — May 4, 2017 1:18 PM Share Dennizen / 123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Have you bought your mom a gift for Mother's Day yet? Google Photos can help you create a cute video to show your mom. Mother’s Day is right around the corner and if you have yet to think of a gift for your mom, Google wants to help. The company has launched a new feature in Google Photos that allows you to turn your photos with your mom into a cutesy little movie that you can show her. Of course, that probably shouldn’t be your only gift. The feature itself is pretty easy to use. Google Photos will give you a list of faces it recognizes, and you can choose one of your mother. You can then pick her children, including yourself and any siblings you have. You could also abuse the feature — it appears as though you could choose anyone to be your mother if you so choose. “It automatically chooses the best photos of the mother and children, and sets it all to music to make a personalized movie,” Google Photos product manager Tim Novikoff wrote in a blog post. “People can make these movies for anyone they want, not just their own mom. I made one for Oana, to celebrate her being such a great mother to our daughter.” Once you have chosen the different people to appear in the movie, the movie itself will pop up in the Google Photos Assistant tab. You will not be able to edit the images picked for the movie so, hopefully, it will turn out well. The feature is especially helpful for those who use Google Photos actively — as there will be a bigger and hopefully better selection of images for Google Photos to choose from. You could, of course, upload your own images to the website solely to create this movie, too. To make a Mother’s Day video for yourself, simply head to photos.google.com/mothersday and hit the “Get Started” button.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Lenovo Moto Tablet 2017 | News and rumors Lenovo Moto Tablet 2017 | News and rumors Motorola's next tablet might ship with an innovative multitasking feature By Kyle Wiggers — May 4, 2017 12:45 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Motorola pioneered the first Android tablet. Now, it might be on the verge of doing the same. Motorola, the Lenovo-owned subsidiary responsible for some of the best — and most modular — budget smartphones around, might be turning its attention to tablets. Reports suggest the company is working on a large, premium device that packs innovative productivity software unlike any other. There is not much to go on, yet, but here is what we know about Motorola’s 2017 tablet so far. Software The most innovative piece about Motorola’s upcoming table is the software, reportedly. According to Android Police, it will ship with “productivity mode,”  a feature that lets you pin apps to the navigation bar and quickly switch between them without having to return to the home screen or Android’s multitasking menu. It appears to have a dedicated app drawer button on the navigation bar, like Google’s Chrome OS, and the ability to run two apps side by side. You can reportedly close apps by long-pressing on an icon and dragging it up, which Android Police speculates means that apps run in the background until explicitly closed. There is a slim chance Motorola’s 2017 tablet runs Andromeda, the rumored Google operating system meant to bridge the gap between Android and Chrome OS. In September 2016, 9to5Google reported that two “major OEMs” were in the process of creating Andromeda devices and that the devices could launch as soon as the first half of 2017. Motorola could be one of them. But as 9to5Google points out, the interface bears a resemblance to Lenovo’s current tablet software. The Yoga Book, for example, has identical navigation buttons. Motorola has a history — albeit a brief one — of collaborating with Google on cutting-edge software. The firm’s Xoom tablet was the first to run Android 3.0 Honeycomb, the first version of Google’s Android operating system optimized for tablets. Specs and screen We do not know much about the tablet’s hardware, yet, but an Android Police source gave a little to go on. It will reportedly measure between nine to 10 inches diagonally, and have a “premium look and feel.” At least one version will offer cellular connectivity. But the rest of the hardware remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know the screen’s resolution, the processor, or the storage configurations. Name, price, and availability The name, price, and release date of Motorola’s 2017 tablet are just as much a mystery as the rest of it. If it is running Google’s futuristic Andromeda, it might launch at the search giant’s I/O developer conference in May. On the other hand, if it ships with vanilla Android, it might be announced later in the year. Whenever Motorola’s 2017 tablet launches, it will almost certainly be cheaper than the Xoom. It started at $600 — about the price of a 32GB iPad.
Digital Trends Home > Home Theater > Premium 4K Streamers: Roku Ultra vs. Amazon Fire… Premium 4K Streamers: Roku Ultra vs. Amazon Fire TV vs. Nvidia Shield vs. Chromecast Ultra By Brendan Hesse — May 4, 2017 12:19 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: So you’ve got the whole setup: a kickin’ sound system, the perfect furniture arrangement, and a new 4K HDR TV to tie it all together. Now it’s time to put it to work. While 4K UHD Blu-ray provides the most reliable way to watch 4K Ultra HD video, streaming services like Netflix or Vudu are a quicker, easier, and more affordable way to get the latest content onto your television. Your new smart TV probably sports some of the apps you need to watch built right in, but a streaming set-top box offers some distinct advantages. The only question is which is the best? To take out the guesswork, we’ve put together this guide detailing everything from content availability and performance to gaming and more, putting the Roku Ultra, Amazon’s Fire TV, Nvidia’s Shield, and Google’s Chromecast Ultra in an all-out cage match. Roku Ultra Amazon Fire TV Nvidia Shield Chromecast Ultra Price  $129  $99 and up   $199 and up  $69 Dedicated remote  Yes  Yes  Yes (gamepad included, traditional remote sold separately)  No (relies on mobile device or computer) Controller app  iOS, Android, Windows 10 and 8.1, OSX  iOS, Android, Windows  Android, iOS  Android Voice search  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes Cross-platform search  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes Available here Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Roku Amazon Amazon, Best Buy, Nvidia Google, Best Buy, Walmart Video quality At the level of 4K streaming boxes, video quality between devices becomes a bit of a wash. 4K Ultra HD video is the crispest, clearest, and highest-quality picture currently available so resolution should be even on each system. Looking a bit closer, however, not all of these devices are totally equal. The Roku Ultra, Nvidia Shield, and Chromecast Ultra all stream up to 4K 60fps, and are HDR compatible. While the Fire TV is technically capable of 4K, it doesn’t support HDR, and its framerate is capped at 30fps. The absence of HDR on the Amazon Fire TV could be an issue if you have an HDR-capable TV and want the very best picture quality. That said, don’t be too put off by the 30fps limitation. Most 4K Ultra HD content delivered at 24fps (for most movies) or 30fps (for TV shows) so the biggest exception will be YouTube videos. In addition, the Chromecast Ultra offers support for the two most prominent HDR standards in HDR10 and Dolby Vision, making it the most versatile, while the Roku and Nvidia streamers only support HDR10. As such, the Chromecast Ultra takes this category by a nose. Winner: Chromecast Ultra Interface We’re big fans Roku’s interface. Roku parses out 4K content for viewers better than its competitors by offering a 4K filter for searches, as well as a 4K spotlight channel highlighting 4K and HDR content. Another highly convenient feature is Roku’s “My Feed” column, which allows users to follow movies, TV shows, directors, and actors, and receives constant updates to keep your searches personalized. The other streamers are a bit more specialized. Amazon Prime members will feel at home with the Fire TV as content is curated best for Prime offerings. Being an Android device, the Shield also tends to prioritize Google offerings, so Google Play fans will be happy with the Shield. As another Google product, the Ultra’s cross-app search is handled via the Google Home app on your mobile device, but most of the time you’ll be navigating from a mobile streaming app instead of a dedicated Chromecast interface, so you’re at the mercy of each app. A point in the Ultra’s favor is that mobile-based apps make it easy to sign in, with little to no extra authentication steps. Ultimately, the Roku Ultra’s platform-agnostic approach and user-friendly search makes its interface our favorite. Winner: Roku Ultra Voice Search and Control All four devices offer some level of voice interaction, but they are each distinctly different. The Fire TV is our favorite when it comes to voice searches, thanks in part to Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa, which offers a ton of interaction beyond just controlling and finding content. You’ll need to be direct and specific with your search terms, but that’s a fair ask in return for the number of things Alexa is capable of, including weather reports, sports scores, searching Wikipedia, and a whole lot more. The Shield features both voice search and control commands via Google Voice, but its voice commands are limited compared to the Fire TV. There’s little else to do beyond opening games and playing content with a phrase, or controlling streaming playback, and the number of supported apps is pretty limited. Similarly, the Chromecast Ultra uses Google voice commands for search, done through the Google Home app. Any other voice commands are dependent on which app(s) you use while casting, however, and search is less accurate than you might expect. The Roku Ultra has basic voice search across multiple apps, but features no voice control commands for playback. As such, the Fire TV takes the win. Winner: Fire TV Remote When it comes to a comprehensive remote that will meet your needs and then some, the Roku’s remote is your best option. It’s got a mic for voice search, a headphone jack for personal listening, and dedicated buttons for services like Amazon Prime and Netflix. What’s more, Bluetooth connection means it’s point-anywhere as opposed to line-of-sight. Finally, there’s a speaker on the remote that will sound when you press a button on the Roku Ultra box; no more lost remote. We’re confident that the Roku’s remote is the best, but let’s go over the others, too. The Chromecast Ultra doesn’t actually have a remote per se, as the device is controlled via tablet or smartphone. So, in a sense, the Chromecast Ultra has the most feature-rich remote of them all, since your phone can do thousands of things a remote can’t. For our purposes however, we’re going to say that doesn’t quite count — what if you need to use your phone, for instance? Also, lock screens can make pausing and rewinding annoying. The Fire TV’s remote is simple, featuring a mic for voice search, navigation controls, and playback buttons, but that’s it. No headphone jack, app buttons, or remote finder features like the Roku has. The Nvidia Shield includes both a gaming controller and a traditional remote, which is great for those who are put off by gaming controllers. That said, neither do much more than fulfill their core functions. Winner: Roku Ultra Apps  Streaming App Roku Ultra Amazon Fire TV Nvidia Shield Chromecast Ultra Amazon Video* X X X DirecTV Now X X X Google Play Movies & TV* X X X Hulu X X X X Kodi* X X Netflix* X X X X PlayStation Vue X X X X Plex* X X X X SlingTV X X X X Vimeo* X X Vudu* X X X YouTube* X X X X YouTube TV X X *App offers 4K content Regardless of which of the four devices you go with, you’ll have access to plenty of streaming apps, including standards like Netflix, and YouTube (which carry tons of 4K content), popular HD apps like Hulu and SlingTV, as well as a host of lesser known options that continues to expand. The point of contention then becomes any major holes in the lineup. As you can see from the chart above, the Nvidia Shield supports an impressive number of some of the most popular apps (though this list is far from exhaustive). In addition, the Nvidia Shield is the only of the four that offers 4K 60fps support for Vimeo and Kodi. The Fire TV lacks the 4K movie streaming service Vudu, and can’t stream content from Vimeo, Google Play Music, or Google Play Movies & TV. Chromecast Ultra has a huge hole in Amazon Video, which carries a serious collection of 4K HDR content, and remains a huge chink in the streamer’s armor (though there are ways to get around it for savvy users). In addition, the Chromecast is missing some lesser-used options like CNNgo and Vimeo. Roku Ultra’s blind spots include YouTube TV and TwitchTV. While Roku still has an incredibly long list of apps it supports (in the thousands) Nvidia’s support of more core content gives it a slight advantage here. Winner: Nvidia Shield Casting The most obvious place to start here is the device with “cast” in its name, the Chromecast Ultra. Casting video from apps on your phone, tablet, or Google Chrome window is how all streaming is done on the Chromecast Ultra, and all Chromecast-compatible iOS and Android apps (of which there are thousands) will do it. However, Chromecast is not the only cast-enabled streamer on the list. The Fire TV allows for casting as well, but it’s limited to Android devices. There are also ways to cast to the Roku Ultra, though it’s more complicated than it’s probably worth to most users. Chromecast looks poised to take this category, but there remains one last challenger. Nvidia supplied the Shield with its own built-in casting tech, so any and all Chromecast functionality is available to iOS and Android users on the Shield. This undermines the Chromecast Ultra’s main point of competition, but the coup de grace is the Nvidia Shield’s ability to stream games from your gaming PC at 4K resolution and 60fps, a feat none of its rivals can claim. Winner: Nvidia Shield Games The Nvidia shield is the only device on this list for which games is just as important a function as streaming, with the strongest graphical capabilities by a mile — unsurprising since Nvidia’s primary business is manufacturing PC video cards. The Shield can play modern classics like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel via it’s GeForce Now service, as well as games available through the Android TV app store. Finally, with Game Stream, you can stream games from your gaming PC directly to your TV, upscaled to 4K resolution and 60fps. Clearly, Nvidia is set to win this category. The other three all have gaming functionality, too, but pale in comparison. Of the three, the Fire TV takes a distant second behind the Shield, since Amazon offers a number of decent games and a controller peripheral is available as an extra purchase. However, if gaming functionality is a primary concern for you, the Nvidia Shield is your best choice. Winner: Nvidia Shield Value The Nvidia Shield comes in two versions: A $199 16GB model, and a $299 500gb model. Both come standard with a micro-SD card slot for storage expansion a gaming controller, and a traditional remote. However, its gaming power makes the Shield quite expensive, meaning it will appeal first and foremost to those looking for a surrogate gaming device. At $129, the Roku Ultra is a lot more affordable, and it has the best remote available as well as the best user interface. The only place The Roku Ultra really falters is as a gaming machine, something the Nvidia Shield and Fire TV do much better. At $99, the Amazon Fire TV looks pretty good. It has a respectable gaming pedigree and modest 4K streaming abilities, making for a reasonable entry point for Amazon Prime users, but it’s not as well rounded as the Roku. Finally, the $69 Chromecast Ultra is the cheapest of the bunch, but it also has the simplest package, doesn’t offer a remote, and doesn’t really have a core interface to speak of. Still, it’s priced far lower than anything else on the list, and gets the job done simply and effectively. Clearly, there are use cases for each of the devices, but it’s hard to argue with a vastly lower price point than all of its peers. Chromecast Ultra takes this one. Winner: Chromecast Ultra Conclusion Going strictly by the tally, the Nvidia Shiled is the winner. It’s excellent for gaming, and offers a list of options as comprehensive as you’ll find. That said, that definitely doesn’t mean it will be the best for you. After all, the Shield is the priciest option on the list. If you’re a thrifty shopper, you know the right choice: Chromecast Ultra by a country mile. However, if you’re all Amazon all the time, you’re probably looking at the Amazon Fire TV — Alexa is an awesome feature to add to the package, after all. On the other hand, Roku’s user experience is the smoothest, its remote is a step above the rest, and it has a mountain of apps at its disposal (even if it didn’t take the category). If we’re making an overall recommendation, Roku Ultra is it. The user experience really is that much better than the others, and its price-to-performance proposition can’t be overlooked. Now you know all you need to. Go get the best device for you, and up your streaming game!

Google Phone 9.0 prepares to add Android O's Notification Channels, picture messaging, post-call messages, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 5:00am PDTMay 2, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 91 Share on Facebook 75 Share on Twitter Total Shares236 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Notification Channels for Android O 1.2 Post-call messaging 1.3 Convenient picture messaging 1.4 Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes 1.5 Cat and dog paws? 2 Download Late last week, an update to Google's Phone app began rolling out with no immediately obvious changes to the experience. While users don't have anything to play with quite yet, there are several interesting hints about what is to come in future releases. Hidden among the app's resources are signs of support for Android O's new Notification Channels feature, in-call picture messaging, post-call messaging, hidden menu codes for Motorola phones, and even some odd images of paws. Yes, seriously. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Notification Channels for Android O While it's a fairly small feature when compared to some of the improvements we've seen in many major OS updates, the Notification Channels brought to us by Android O are exciting. Most of Google's apps are still not implementing this addition to the API, but it's clearly in the works with the Phone app. While they don't appear to be fully implemented yet, names have been added to the latest apk update that describe six separate channels, including: Incoming calls, Ongoing calls, Missed calls, Voicemails, External calls, and Miscellaneous. <string name="notification_channel_incoming_call">Incoming calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_ongoing_call">Ongoing calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_missed_call">Missed calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_voicemail">Voicemails</string> <string name="notification_channel_external_call">External calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_misc">Miscellaneous</string> That's a pretty thorough list given the nature of the Phone app and the types of notifications it shows, especially since most users will probably never even see a couple of them. While the strings are there, only the standard Miscellaneous channel is visible in the notification settings screen for the Phone app. In all likelihood, the implementation probably wasn't complete when this update was built, so we can probably expect to see it in the next release, or possibly when the second developer preview image becomes available. Post-call messaging Receive a phone call today on almost any modern phone and you can probably tap or swipe something on the screen to reject it and immediately reply with a pre-written text message to say you're unavailable or will call back shortly. It can be a useful feature, even if it's just for those times when you're driving or stuck in a meeting. But what should the caller do if they don't get through? Leaving a voicemail is turning to be too cumbersome, so many people now send a text instead. New lines in this update suggest the same type of prepared text messages might be added for the caller, as well. There are a few new lines going into this feature, but three are the new, pre-written messages meant to convey varying degrees of importance. They are simple messages crafted to let the target of the call know that your needs are urgent, important but not time sensitive, or you just called to chat. <string name="post_call_add_message">Add message</string> <string name="post_call_message">Say why you called</string> <string name="post_call_message_1">This is urgent. Call me back.</string> <string name="post_call_message_2">Call me back when you have some time.</string> <string name="post_call_message_3">Not urgent, we can chat later.</string> <string name="post_call_message_sent">Message sent</string> There aren't any other clues to suggest how this feature will be presented to the caller or if a custom message can be written from the same screen, but it's likely this feature wasn't complete yet, either. Unless some clever tricks are necessary to make this feature smart, it seems like there probably won't have to be too much more work, so it may go live with the next update. Convenient picture messaging For many years, phone manufacturers have experimented with bringing certain features to the surface during calls so users don't have to spend too much time poking at their phone to do things that people are likely to need in the moment. One feature that has been popping up occasionally, even as far back as the days of dumb phones, was the ability to quickly take a picture and send it directly to the person in the same conversation. It looks like the same feature is probably destined for Google's Phone app. <string name="received_a_photo">Received a photo</string> <string name="sent_a_photo">Sent a photo</string> There are a few other strings possibly related to this feature, but the two above are the only ones that really matter. They represent the basic status messages to show a picture was sent or received. Again, it's not really clear if there are any clever features that make this a little smarter, but I have a hunch the Phone app will listen for messages containing images (I assume both MMS and RCS) and instead of making users switch to their messaging app, the photos will be shown automatically or with an on-screen button. Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes Hacking around with a phone can be fun and enable a lot of powerful features, but it often involves a lot of secret methods that aren't intended for the public. Dialer codes have been used as one of the key methods for accessing special menus and functions. A long list of Motorola's dialer codes was included in the latest Phone update. Some of these are pretty old, but at least a few of them didn't turn up in any of my searches, so I thought some people might want to experiment with them. Disclaimer: Use of these dialer codes is done at your own risk. Some of these may damage your phone and/or void its warranty. You've been warned. If you want some information on many of these codes, you can find about 3/4 of them listed in this 2012 post by well-known security expert JCase. The behavior of the remaining codes is currently unknown and didn't turn up in my research. Only try them out if you know what you're doing and prepared for the possible consequences. code <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_sequence"> <item>\##66236#</item> <item>\##2539#</item> <item>\##786#</item> <item>\##72786#</item> <item>\##3282#</item> <item>\##33284#</item> <item>\##3424#</item> <item>\##564#</item> <item>\##4567257#</item> <item>\##873283#</item> <item>\##6343#</item> <item>\##27263#</item> <item>\##258#</item> <item>\##8422#</item> <item>\##4382#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern"> <item>\##[0-9]{6}#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern_intents"> <item>@string/motorola_hidden_menu_intent</item> </string-array> Cat and dog paws? Finally, a couple of quirky images were added to this update. A pair of paws, one belonging to a cat and the other to a dog, can now be found in the apk's resources. Note: Images were converted from webp to png. I'm not yet sure what they are used for, if they belong to an Easter egg, or maybe somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we were still watching. Both images have transparent backgrounds and look like they could be used for a simple animation where a paw reaches up to grab an object on the screen and drag it away. Whatever the case, ya gotta love the whimsy and humor. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Is there a mistake in there? Cody Toombs yep, I must have made a mistake in editing. Fixed it. Thanks KChristainsen Will this ever open up to non nexus devices? Gonzales Probably not. It would be nice for OEMs to give us a choice, but I doubt it will ever happen DragoCubed Dog 🐅 and cat 🐈 paws. :3 awwwwww DynamikD That is definitely a tiger 🐅. DragoCubed I hate the Samsung emoji makapav I bet it will still not support sending call-reject text messages through Google Voice. Sigh... Kyle Salewski Yeah. Even hitting the Message button on a contact won't work. They really need to allow Voice to be the default SMS app makapav Well done bro. You're a fellow dedicated Google Voice user to figure that out and complain about it. I wanted to bring that use case here to my rant but figured probably no one else jumps through that hoop like me! ;-) Clearly Google has the laziest/clueless Android users on their team because some of these obvious use cases go unknown to them. chocolate_drizzle I think they should add seemless Google Duo integration by adding a video calling option in the app. What do you guys think? DynamikD I think you are on to something! 👍 bunchofpenguins Facetime does this where you can press a button and switch right to Facetime. I have been wanting this in Android forever. Chris My girlfriend and I enjoy using Duo all the time, so this would be perfect. But then Google would need to release their Phone app for all Android phones in the Play Store. Carson Saldanha No, they could just add support for it in their own. Andy J If the photo features are indeed for RCS (and sending photos while in a phone call is indeed a feature specifically detailed in the RCS spec) - then in the same way Messages is available to all Android phones, the phone app would also have to be on the store. And the Contacts app will probably go on too - because a key part of the RCS spec is that the phone address book will show which contacts have "enhanced messaging" available. Chris I hope so. I love the Google Dialer and Contacts but I have to use an old APK to get it to run on non Nexus or Pixel devices. Deeco Too logical for Google JG I could see where that could come in handy... However I'm not sure if Duo has picked up enough traction to really make it useful enough to integrate it into the dialer. If the recipient doesn't have Duo installed (as possibly would be the case the majority of the time - at least from personal experience) then a Duo video call button would just be extra clutter... Berni Hargrove But this is how you give it traction. Intuitively integrate it into a regularly used feature/app of the phone. The dialer is a perfect fit to help give Duo more relevance. Biga173rd Does this APK work with non pixel phones? Siddharth Nope except Nexus devices Biga173rd Thanks Cody Toombs It's meant for a few things people forget, but definitely not all phones. The full list should be: Pixel, Nexus, Android One, and Motorola. Carpentractor Ok, I have been experiencing a weird bug with my Pixel keypad while in call. Basically, the keypad gets smushed when accessing the keypad in call and it cuts off the letters ​under the numbers, which are sort of useful when spelling last names for extensions... It happened to me several updates ago and uninstalling all of the updates for the app and putting it back to how the phone came originally would fix that issue, but obviously take away any new features that have been added to the dialer. But, this time when I tried to uninstall the app updates, it didn't fix the issue! Everytime I see an update for the dialer, I get excited that they may have fixed it, but to no avail. My girlfriend has a Nexus 5X and she does not have the issue. I have attached a screenshot, please let me know if anyone has a solution or is even experiencing the issue. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd8b277825ef665ffa607ce2aa8b3a0004b8109cba32e68655dcd11afd7834ec.png DynamikD I, personally, have never experienced this and I have the same device as you. By any chance, are you running any 3rd party app(s) that also integrated into the dialer? Carpentractor I don't think so, I did have Skype installed at one point, but I did uninstall it. What kind of 3rd party apps might integrate with the dialer? I guess I can try to boot up in safe mode.... Rod What's your font size? Carpentractor Large. Carpentractor So, I changed my font back to default and it did solve the problem. Is there no way to have my font set to large and have the dialer format properly? My girlfriend has her font set to large with no issues on her 5x. This is whacky! Rod Have you changed the DPI? Carpentractor Not as far as anything beyond having my display size also set to large. Morenicano $5 says this will be a new messenger app by next year Richard Dennis and they will move half of Allo's features to it.. So you now need both apps... And hangouts is a new email app. Yuku Sugianto Why do Motorola codes appear on Google's Phone app? Probably the next Nexus/Pixel line phone will be made by Motorola, and Motorola service staff are already accustomed to those codes to diagnose problems. Cody Toombs Sorry to kill this theory, but Motorola has a arrangement with Google to use a lot of Google's first party apps. It's been in place basically since Google bought it and began shipping the Moto X with nearly stock AOSP with some product specific enhancements. As far as I am aware, all (or most?) Motorola phones use Google's Phone app. Even if that weren't the explanation, the Nexus 6 would be. I mean, a Moto-made Pixel could still happen, but these phone codes aren't evidence of that. Kevin Burton Could the "paws" be for sequence dialing? When a "pause" is entered you get a "paw" displayed on the phone? AintaDamnThingFunny I like the phone app. My only complaint is it's not the most intuitive thing on earth to try and answer/reject a call by swiping up/down. I routinely need 3 or 4 tries to get it. Or maybe it's just me? I think swiping side to side is easier. Maxr1998 "somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we we're still watching" - that one "we" seems to be too much 😜 SomeGuy112 I notice the button animation is gone when pressing the button to bring up the dialer now.

The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. © AP In this Nov. 18, 2016 photo, a faded photo collage showing images of the 14 victims who were killed in the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino terror attack is adorned with artificial flowers at a makeshift memorial near the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif., where the shooting took place. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. © REUTERS/Mike Blake People light candles in preparation for a vigil in San Bernardino Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

CMOs know this but nobody wants to talk about it even though advertisers wasted $7.4 billion on poor-quality ad placement in 2016 alone,” the report found. “Brand marketers have to stop being seduced by the crack cocaine of low cost CPMs” said Randall Rothenberg, CEO of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry trade group. “The biggest culprits are the brand marketers themselves who are willing to turn a blind eye to the content.” He said Procter & Gamble, JPMorgan Chase and Johnson & Johnson are leading a push toward quality.

Comedian Kevin Hart, talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres and the comedy duo Rhett & Link are producing unscripted shows that will debut this year, YouTube will announce at an event for advertisers in New York Thursday. Alphabet Inc.’s Google also will increase its spending on YouTube Red, a paid video and music streaming service launched in October 2015. The plans mark a shift for Google, which has typically treated its huge video library as a web free-for-all rather than a home for TV shows. But as more digital rivals venture into high-quality programming, YouTube is feeling pressure to respond, devoting resources to more costly projects and aiming for a wider audience. The company will fund more than 40 original shows and movies in the next year, spending hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the plans. YouTube is betting high-profile stars will attract more advertisers like Johnson & Johnson, which is sponsoring “Best.Cover.Ever,” a music competition from Ryan Seacrest that’s scheduled for later this year. “We’re working with YouTube stars and big celebrities that we know have global appeal, advertiser appeal and are largely established on the platform,” Susanne Daniels, YouTube’s head of original content, said in an interview. YouTube’s mission at the annual Newfront presentations in New York, where online companies are introducing their latest initiatives this week, is to convince marketers to shift more ad money to the web from TV. Original programming is front and center, with YouTube pitching premium shows that it says merit big commitments from sponsors. Those efforts got more complicated last month when advertisers discovered some of their spots appeared next to extremist videos. YouTube adopted new rules and said the scandal had minimal impact on sales. Still advertisers are wary of a site that relies on so many user videos, which makes it harder to ensure ads run alongside high-quality shows. Who’ll Blink? “The two biggest players in the Newfronts are YouTube and Hulu, yet neither tells you exactly where your ad ran,” said Ben Winkler, chief investment officer of OMD USA, part of the Omnicom Group Inc. advertising company. “I expect YouTube will be the first to blink.” DeGeneres, who hosts one of the most popular talk shows on TV, will take viewers behind the scenes of her program. Hart, a popular comedian, will try a different trendy workout routine every week alongside celebrity guests in “Kevin Hart: What the Fit?” The show will debut on his Laugh Out Loud Network on YouTube. YouTube also will help Rhett & Link expand on their already popular “Good Mythical Morning” to create a series that feels every bit as grand as TV talk shows. While most recent episodes feature the two hosts at a desk, the revamped version, in its 11th season, will include more guests, challenges and correspondents. “We want to be seen as legit in ways by people who don’t see internet shows as legit,” said Rhett, whose real name is Rhett James McLaughlin. “But the way to do that is not to imitate late-night TV shows.” YouTube decided to fund ad-supported programs more than a year ago after executives saw a study on the growing number of TV shows being produced. Most of the new shows appear on premium services with no ads. That created an opening. Global Scale “We’re turning the infrastructure we’ve built for original programming into supporting our biggest partners,’’ Robert Kyncl, YouTube’s chief business officer, said in an interview. “Nobody is doing it the way we are. Nobody can release originals on a global basis with the scale we have in advertising.’’ YouTube’s parent Google reported more than $21 billion in ad sales in the first quarter -- more than the entire U.S. TV industry. Google has already captured ad budgets that went to print. Now the company wants a larger share from TV. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The funding of shows with commercials won’t reduce YouTube’s commitment to the $9.99-a-month Red, which doesn’t have ads. The company backed almost 30 programs on Red last year, and plans to spend even more this year and next. YouTube has talked to partners about releasing programs on Red that cost $3 million to $6 million per hour -- budgets comparable to HBO and Showtime, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the private spending plans. The big question for Hollywood -- and advertisers -- is where YouTube may go next. Five years ago, the company invested $100 million in dozens of projects, including ones from comedian Amy Poehler and basketball star Shaquille O’Neal. YouTube then shifted strategy, supporting popular filmmakers and actors with promotional campaigns and production facilities in major cities instead. YouTube operates large studios in nine cities, including Los Angeles, London and Mumbai. YouTube is taking a different tack with these new shows. For the new lineup, YouTube recruited a mix of traditional stars and new ones -- all of whom have large followings. Demi Lovato, who allowed cameras to follow her while writing and recording a new album, has more than 10 million subscribers on her Vevo channel. DeGeneres has almost 20 million on YouTube, while “Good Mythical Morning” tops 12 million. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The single-board computer (SBC) is now the most popular cornerstone for all sorts of DIY projects, from gaming emulators to the new Internet of Things. Jumping on that bandwagon, Google has teamed up with the Raspberry Pi Foundation to build RPi-compatible kits that will take users on a journey of AI discovery, starting with a Voice Kit. The Raspberry Pi is already being used for many AI experiments but most of those revolve around physical controls, be it keyboard or touch screen. Google says those are so 2000s, Voice is the new black, so to speak, and Google is only too happy to get you started on that path. Using its Assistant and Cloud services, of course. The Voice Kit that it is promoting has the complete hardware you’ll need to add audio capture and playback capabilities to a Raspberry Pi. Sans the Raspberry Pi itself. That includes a totally new Voice HAT (Hardware Accessory on Top) for the popular board, a speaker, and connectors. Amusingly, the enclosure for the kit, which has room for the RPi, is made out of cardboard, the ultimate DIY chassis and a nod to the Cardboard VR. Google Assistant isn’t the only thing you can run on RPi with Voice Kit either. Google has just opened up its Android Things, its name (for now) for its IoT thrust) to also work with this new kit. In fact, it is launching a whole new endeavor called AIY Projects, short for AI DIY, to try and bring the Maker community into the collective. The new Voice Kit comes free in every physical copy of this month’s MagPi magazine. You can also download a digital copy of that issue (PDF) but, of course, it won’t come with the kit. You can, however, buy it separately from Barnes & Noble stores.

By Tas Bindi | May 5, 2017 -- 02:06 GMT (19:06 PDT) | Topic: Legal Google has agreed to pay €306 million in back taxes to Italy and Ireland to end a criminal investigation into whether the company avoided paying the full amount on its revenues for more than a decade, Italian tax officials confirmed on Thursday. The agreement resolves multiple disputes including a criminal probe that saw Milan prosecutors accuse Google of generating revenues of €1 billion in Italy and Ireland between 2009 and 2013. The sum also settles other disputes for the tax years 2002-2006 and 2014-2015. what's hot on zdnet The death of the smartphone and the birth of the next big thing The new Surface Laptop is no Chromebook C3 IoT CEO Tom Siebel: CEO, boards driving IoT, digital transformation deals Hundreds of privacy-invading apps are using ultrasonic sounds to track you Tax officials said the settlement also launches a process to determine Google's proper taxation level in Italy going forward. Google said €303 million was attributed to Google Italy and the remainder to Google Ireland. This is "in addition to the corporate tax already paid in Italy for these years", Google said. The company worked out a similar deal with the UK over a year ago, paying £130 million to British tax authorities. A few months after reaching the settlement, the UK government introduced its Diverted Profits Tax -- nicknamed the 'Google Tax -- to prevent the practice of multinational organisations shifting profits made in the UK offshore to avoid paying tax. The Australian government also introduced legislation of the same name in March hitting multinationals -- with global revenue of more than AU$1 billion and Australian revenue of greater than AU$25 million -- with a 40 percent tax on all profits. In late 2015, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development released recommendations in a bid to claw back as much as $240 billion in lost revenue each year through suspicious tax practices across the globe, such as funnelling money through certain countries in order to pay a lower tax rate. Last year, European officials proposed new regulations that would require large, multinational companies -- with global revenues exceeding €750 million and with a presence in the European Union -- to report the amount of revenue they generate and the tax they pay in each European country they operate in, in addition to providing a summary of how much tax they pay in other countries. The European Commission estimated at the time that EU loses as much as €70 billion per year due to corporate tax avoidance. The new rules are expected to come into effect in 2018. The biggest outstanding dispute in Europe concerns a €13 billion tax bill that Ireland was ordered by the European Commission to assign to Apple. Ireland in December said it would appeal the European Commission's ruling that declared tax arrangements between Apple and Ireland -- originally established in 1991 -- had allowed the company to pay "substantially less tax" than rival companies, and were therefore illegal under state aid rules. Google is currently facing another case in France where the authorities believe it owes €1.6 billion in back taxes. France's finance minister Michel Sapin said last year that he won't negotiate a deal with Google, but will instead pursue legal action. However, at the end of 2016, France's Constitutional Council ruled against a new measure, dubbed the Google Tax, that would tax "diverted profits" up to 60 percent. The French government said it wanted to make it more attractive for foreign businesses looking for a new European location after Brexit. Italian tax officials have also reportedly started proceedings against Amazon last week, which could owe €130 million for passing its earnings through Luxembourg.

India obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter about us Atlas quartz index quartz app quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu HUNGRY FOR MORE Google and Uber are learning money can’t buy them victory in India’s brutal food-delivery wars Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Sourced 5 hours ago Quartz india The appetite hasn't been satiated yet. (Reuters/Danish Siddiqui) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Sourced 5 hours ago Quartz india India’s food-tech scene has been quite the party—but the guest list is starting to become more and more exclusive. Many of the nascent companies that set up shop during food tech’s heyday in 2014 could not deal with growing pains and started falling like dominoes in 2015: In October, delivery startup Dazo shuttered. Bengaluru-based delivery platform Eatlo closed its platform in December, barely a year after it launched. Others resorted to drastic measures to stay afloat. For instance, online food-delivery startup Swiggy started testing surge pricing à la Uber and Mumbai-based on-demand delivery firm TinyOwl laid off hundreds of employees and shut operations in a number of cities to streamline its business. In a candid blog post, Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of the Yelp-like restaurant-discovery and ordering platform Zomato, which fired around 300 employees—10% of its workforce—amid slipping valuations and widening losses, labeled 2015 “truly our year of learning.” In 2016, the bloodbath continued. Food tech investments plummeted from $500 million in 2015 to $80 million. Consolidation became the flavor of the season: In June 2016, TinyOwl was acquired by hyperlocal-delivery startup RoadRunnr; the two merged into a new company, Runnr. In December, Delivery Hero acquired rival FoodPanda. A slew of other startups—Zupermeal, iTiffin, EazyMeals, Zeppery, BiteClub—all bit the dust. This year, as food tech strives to get back on its feet, two Silicon Valley behemoths—Google and Uber—have chosen to dance in the rain in India: Google launched Aero, a restaurant delivery and home services platform, in early April. Uber followed suit on May 2, announcing that its on-demand food-delivery arm UberEATS was going live. The question is, will they ride the waves or will they go under? The playing field Entering the industry in the current climate looks like a recipe for disaster at first glance. In 2016, 56 deals—cumulatively worth over $88 million—were made in the food-tech space, according to data financial-research platform VCCEdge shared with Quartz. The first quarter of 2017 saw far fewer deals and a much lower total investment than the same quarter in 2016. However, the market doesn’t seem to only be spiraling down: Compared to Q4 2016, the total amount invested in Q1 2017 actually increased by over $5 million. A food-tech company succeeds by being at the “right intersection of innovation, speed, and cost,” says Venkat Shastry, a partner at global executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles’ Bengaluru office. Speed and cost seem relatively easy for big tech firms because of their deep pockets, technological prowess, and established sophisticated delivery mechanisms. But logistics is only half the story—companies need to innovate by developing a core understanding of Indian customer preferences. “For example, Unilever, Pepsi, and KFC made long-term investments in the market to customize experiences and appeal to the Indian customer’s palate,” Shastry says. To succeed, Uber and Google similarly will need to create a delivery model that caters to the price-sensitive, cash-dependent Indian customer. At the outset, both companies are being cautious and feeling out the market. So far, the online food delivery startups that have been successful have had their achievements concentrated in a handful of regions—more than 80% of orders come from the top five cities in India, according to a study published by Bengaluru-based RedSeer Consulting. Learning from the domestic companies that tried and failed to penetrate a large number of markets, Google and Uber are focusing on urban centers for now. The search giant has launched operations in India’s IT and commercial hubs—Bengaluru and Mumbai respectively. Uber’s food delivery service is just available to Mumbaikars for now. The upper hand Experienced Silicon Valley players do have a leg up on their Indian counterparts when it comes to time- and cost-efficiency. Amazon’s massive $5 billion investment in India’s e-commerce space is a drop in the ocean for the $430 billion dollar e-tailer, but completely eclipses anything local companies could spend. The e-commerce sector’s fate will likely play out in food delivery to some extent: Google and Uber can easily bite into local players’ market share by slicing prices, thanks to their massive capital base from their global operations. For instance, an UberEats customer doesn’t have to fill a minimum order size and will pay a Rs15 ($0.23) delivery fee—half of Swiggy’s Rs30 to Rs40 ($0.47 to $0.62) delivery charge (for orders below a certain amount). Having lots of capital also means you can take more risks. If Google’s food delivery doesn’t take off, its home-services section that lets people order plumbers, electricians, or painters, might still become a hit. As less successful startups get weeded out and larger international players make huge monetary and infrastructure commitments, it may feel like local entrants have no hope. But that’s not true. Local flavor Although the likes of Google and Facebook are making moves to bring more Indians online, only 26% of the population has access to internet. Brands like Uber and Google that are household names in the US are still not commonplace in many parts of India. And if the brands can’t reel in customers on the basis of their names, they have to compete more fiercely at a local level. “The biggest barriers [are] the local Indian restaurants who have been traditionally already doing the delivery service…[and] which already have an established network,” Shalini Prakash, of the India-based accelerator 500 Startups, told Quartz. Domestic services like Swiggy and Runnr already partner with a wide variety of restaurants. Even though there are no rules against restaurants selling on multiple platforms, customers may not switch delivery services—even if it’s cheaper—out of loyalty, convenience, or simple lack of awareness. Another way upcoming domestic businesses can compete is to “look it into unique food products which becomes their USP [unique selling point],” says Prakash, citing the Mumbai-based startup Raw Pressery, one of the first—and highest-funded—companies to package and deliver cold-pressed juices. In a country with 29 states where people speak at least 22 different languages and eat many different kinds of cuisines, there are myriad unexplored local and international food options that are still open to tech companies who can do them right, Prakash says. And let’s not forget that food tech is more than just online delivery—and non-delivery services is an area where local companies appear better placed to succeed. According to VCCEdge, funding in Q1 2017 backed a diverse range of startups—from those processing and packing fresh meats to those delivering run-of-the-mill household products like milk and eggs to others offering platforms to book professional chefs. Company Type of business Deal Value City Delightful Gourmet process, pack, and deliver chicken, lamb, and seafood $10 million Bengaluru Maverix Platforms produce and sell ready-to-cook food products $3 million Mumbai Love Food Ventures produce packed perishable goods $500,000 Bengaluru D I Infosolutions online food delivery $440,000 New Delhi Supr Techlabs delivery of daily need products like milk, eggs, etc. $120,000 Mumbai Pod Conceptions Services delivery of natural, artisanal, and homegrown food undisclosed Mumbai FreshToHome Foods e-marketplace for fresh, chemical-free seafood undisclosed Bengaluru Commercio Connectivity booking professional chefs undisclosed Bengaluru Supply Chain Analytics and Technologies online fruits and grocery store undisclosed Delhi Starting fresh “India is like the wild west right now,” says Sandeep Murthy, co-founder of Mumbai-based Lightbox VC. “So many businesses have been serving such a massive consumer need in such a fragmented way.” With the advent of technology, the sector is looking for businesses that can deliver consistent, scalable value over time. Beyond pizza chain Domino’s, India doesn’t really have highly penetrative brands in its food sector, Murthy notes. There are also no mega brands waiting to fill the space. “[In the US, I watch] some reporter talking about Amazon eating somebody else’s lunch…they’re always talking about old world retailers figuring out how to grow their business online,” says Murthy. Indian food tech companies won’t run into that problem. “If you think about who would the old-world guy be [in India], there’s no one.” This means new brands and chains can build themselves up on tech-enabled platforms directly. Startups operating on a kitchen-based model, wherein they cook, package, and deliver the food, are cut out for success. Controlling the quality of food keeps customers coming back and keeps these startups in the running while services that aggregate restaurant choices and do last-mile delivery are the ones fading out, according to Murthy. (He admits he’s biased. Lightbox VC backs on-demand food startup Faasos, which makes and delivers meals to customers’ homes from 9am to midnight daily across 15 Indian cities.) The American companies likely won’t cannibalize these kinds of businesses. In fact, Murthy views them as another retail avenue for local businesses. “It’s great. Let them distribute our product as well,” Murthy says. There’s still room for plenty more players, as long as they have a clear-cut business model that can work with or despite Google and Uber. “Pick your aspect, pick your strength, and try to compete,” says Murthy. “Whoever’s got the best pick and shovel can do some damage and find the right gold.” Most Popular This is what happened to the scientist who stuck his head inside a particle accelerator Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 74 Plus 1 on G+ 313 Share on Facebook 119 Share on Twitter Total Shares506 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Stock Android is always buttery smooth. Even when it isn't. Louis Smith I'm in the same boat. Sold my OP3, Loved the phone, but someone else wanted it. I just kept on going back to my N6P. Hopefully the next one will be the same size as the 6P Matt He wants to be exclusive. He's a jealous Pixel lover.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

With Map Maker closed, road segment editing is available to all users on Google Maps Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 8:49am PDTMay 4, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Applications Google News Map Maker was completely shut down on April 2nd and at the time, Google promised that its features would find their way to the main Google Maps app. Part of them was implemented long ago last September with the addition of missing info and fact checking cards, but that left the main Map Maker function of editing road segments. It was enabled for Local Guides a while ago and according to a post on the Local Guides Connect community, it has been made available for everyone on April 27. Sure enough, I checked on my phone and I can see the option to edit road segments. You have to open the side menu, scroll down to Send Feedback, and choose Edit the map. After that, you can pick any road segment and suggest a new name, say the road is 1- or 2-way, tell it the road is closed, and so on. I'm not sure how long these options have been there for — we're inclined to think at least a couple of months, depending on your Local Guide level — but they appear to be accessible to everyone since April 27. They might seem a little hidden away under the Send Feedback menu (that's usually a section users don't venture into that often), but it's probably precisely for that reason that they've been tucked there. You don't want any and all Maps users to suggest edits for the fun of it without knowing what they're doing.

The only real difference now is when you're reporting an issue with how a road is drawn or two-way status or something like that (something you could always do), you can now directly select which road segment you're talking about to make your report more clear instead of trying to describe the location. And there's still no way to report issues with lane guidance (aside from typing it in as a note on a report that is labeled as something completely unrelated to lane guidance), which has about a 2% accuracy rate around here.... catalysto Works for me. XerBlade Really? Because I just read through Google's official article introducing this "road editing" and how this works, and it was exactly what I just described. In other words, they are stretching the meaning of "editing roads" to the extreme. Literally the ONLY difference between what you could do before and what you can do now is you can select multiple road segments when making a report instead of just dropping a pin on a single spot. The reports themselves are the same. No actual editing any roads. Morten Ulv Map maker was never available in my country and reporting this way works great. Issues are usually fixed within a week. Getting these better tools now is just a bonus for me. iMarbot Like I said months ago. Google lied about bringing MapMaker into Maps. You simply cannot do anything as comprehensive. Ome Dries Despite the few pranks people pulled with Map Maker, I think it was a great product and a very important factor for Google Map's success. Were other maps (including the paid maps on my navigation system) are always outdated, not containing new roads or still having older roads, and almost almost missing details in roads (and bike roads) Google Maps was always better. It's an advantage they could now be loosing, because even with today's update they don't have a full substitute for Map Maker. PANDAMONIUM🚀 Since they restricted Map Maker I've found Google Maps to be very very slow in updating roads that have been recently paved or changed due to construction or new construction. Waze is a better option now for a more accurate navigation experience in my area. And their map editing tools are far superior. They also are heavily moderated, but they didn't do what Google did with Maps. Google just took a machete and cut off the whole limb because of a few bad apples. All they needed to do was follow Waze's guidelines and they'd be set. utack >Google Maps was always better I am guessing your sample size is only USA on this? Anjo Cerdeña It's still available for select regions only.

Anjo Cerdeña Because you're not following me on Google+ yet? 🙃 https://plus.google.com/+AnjoCerdeña/posts/CDKD2kXPJbW Rita El Khoury That's exactly the source of this post. But the reason I said we don't know when these started showing up is because they might have popped up before they were announced on the Connect community. Google isn't always fast in acknowledging something is happening and we've often covered features for Local Guides that weren't yet officially announced. Anjo Cerdeña Right, and the availability is geographically limited on announcement day too. I'm a Level 5 Local Guide in the Philippines and I still don't have it yet.

By Michael Kan U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 4, 2017 4:20 PM PT Credit: Michael Kan More like this Sneaky Gmail phishing attack fools with fake Google Docs app Russian hackers use OAuth, fake Google apps to phish users Google beefs up security in Android Gmail app following Docs phishing scam Video How to minimize the risks of phishing scams Google has stopped Wednesday’s clever email phishing scheme, but the attack may very well make a comeback. One security researcher has already managed to replicate it, even as Google is trying to protect users from such attacks. “It looks exactly like the original spoof,” said Matt Austin, director of security research at Contrast Security. [ Your guide to top tech conferences 2017 ] The phishing scheme -- which may have circulated to 1 million Gmail users -- is particularly effective because it fooled users with a dummy app that looked like Google Docs. Recipients who received the email were invited to click a blue box that said “Open in Docs.” Those who did were brought to an actual Google account page that asks them to handover Gmail access to the dummy app. While fooling users with spoofed emails is nothing new, Wednesday’s attack involved an actual third-party app made with real Google processes. The company’s developer platform can enable anyone to create web-based apps. In this case, the culprit chose to name the app “Google Docs” in an effort to trick users. The search company has shut down the attack by removing the app. It’s also barred other developers from using “Google” in naming their third-party apps. However, Austin found he could still reproduce Wednesday’s phishing scheme. He did so, by using the search company’s developer platform to create his own third-party app, and also called it “Google Docs.” Michael Kan Security researcher Matt Austin replicated Wednesday's phishing attack using Cyrillic script.  The only difference is that Austin used a Cyrillic character, used in Russia, for the letter “o” in his app’s name. “The Cyrillic letter o looks exactly like the other letter o,” Austin said. He then replicated the rest of the Wednesday’s attack, creating a fake email that uses the same design interface.   Austin has submitted the security issue to Google, and now its developer platform no longer accepts apps under that name. However, he and other security experts predict that bad actors are also working on replicating Wednesday’s attack. “There’s no question that this will be repeated again,” said Ayse Kaya, a director at Cisco Cloudlock Cyberlabs, a security provider. “It will probably happen much more often.” More traditional phishing email schemes can strike by tricking users into giving up their login credentials. However, Wednesday’s attack takes a different approach and abuses what’s known as the OAuth protocol, a convenient way for internet accounts to link with third-party applications. Through OAuth, users don’t have to hand over any password information. They instead grant permission so that one third-party app can connect to their internet account, at say, Google, Facebook or Twitter. But like any technology, OAuth can be exploited. Back in 2011, one developer even warned that the protocol could be used in a phishing attack with apps that impersonate Google services. Nevertheless, OAuth has become a popular standard used across IT. CloudLock has found that over 276,000 apps use the protocol through services like Google, Facebook and Microsoft Office 365. What aided Wednesday’s phishing scheme was that Google’s own services didn’t do enough to point out it came from a suspicious developer, said Aaron Parecki, an IT consultant who helps businesses implement OAuth. For instance, the dummy Google Docs app was registered to a developer at eugene.pupov@gmail.com -- a red flag that the product wasn’t real. However, the dummy app still managed to fool users because Google’s own account permission page never plainly listed the developer’s information, unless the user clicks the page to find out, Parecki said. Cloudlock The developer behind the fake Google Docs app only appears if you mouse over the product informaiton.  “I was surprised Google didn’t show much identifying information with these apps,” he said. “It’s a great example of what can go wrong.” Rather than hide those details, all of it should be shown to users, Parecki said.   Austin agreed, and said apps that ask for permission to Gmail should include a more blatant warning over what the user is handing over. “I’m not on the OAuth hate bandwagon yet. I do see it as valuable,” Austin said. “But there are some risks with it.” Fortunately, Google was able to quickly foil Wednesday’s attack, and is introducing “anti-abuse systems” to prevent it from happening again. Users who might have been affected can do a Google security checkup to review what apps are connected to their accounts. The company’s Gmail Android app is also introducing a new security feature to warn users about possible phishing attempts.   It's tempting to install apps and assume they're safe. But users and businesses need to be careful when linking accounts to third-party apps, which might be asking for more access than they need, Cloudlock's Kaya said.  "Hackers have a headstart exploiting this attack," she said. "All companies need to be thinking about this."

Google Chrome Is Ramping Up Warnings When You Visit Insecure Websites Adam Turner May 5, 2017, 11:00am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories google google chrome smh Share Image: Supplied Google's Chrome web browser is stepping up alerts when you use sites missing that all-important HTTPS security padlock designed to stop online eavesdropping. Of all the security and privacy precautions you should take to stay safe online, one of the easiest is to always check that a website uses HTTPS encryption before you enter sensitive information such as payment details. Unfortunately it's easy to forget about this when you reach an online checkout and finally seal the deal on that new thingamabob you've been waiting to buy. HTTPS isn't just for online shopping, it's important to check the security status of any website which asks you to enter sensitive information, such as online banking, webmail, cloud storage/services, social media, online forums and content management systems. Google also uses it to safeguard your online searches. Think of HTTPS a bit like a mini-VPN just for that individual browser tab. It doesn't stop people seeing which page you're visiting, but it creates an encrypted tunnel from your browser all the way to the webpage server to stop anyone in between snooping on your activities. HTTPS is still important even if you're using a VPN, as the VPN only protects your data as far as the VPN server. Perhaps more importantly, HTTPS also relies on signed security certificates to ensure that you haven't accidentally visited a spoof website masquerading as your bank or a legit online retailer. Google's Chrome web browser is already one of the best at drawing your attention to HTTPS. It displays a green padlock with the word "Secure" alongside the website address, plus it often displays the name of the company to which the security certificate was issued – something you probably see when you use online banking. There's a push to use HTTPS across the web, with Electronic Frontiers Foundation even offering the HTTPS Everywhere browser plugin to force sites to use HTTPS if the website developer has enabled it. At the moment the Chrome browser draws attention to any website which doesn't use HTTPS, although it only displays a subtle "i" symbol where the padlock should be. Click here for more information and you're told; "You should not enter any sensitive information on this site (for example, passwords or credit cards), because it could be stolen by attackers." Google is about to ramp up these warnings in an effort to force websites to lift their security game. Chrome already marks websites not using HTTPS as "Not secure" if they ask for credit card or password details. As of October, Chrome will mark non-HTTPS websites as "Not secure" as soon as you start to type anything into the page. Chrome will also ramp up HTTPS warnings when you're using Incognito mode, on the assumption that you're looking for a little extra privacy. Keep in mind that Incognito mode doesn't hide your destination from your ISP, it simply ensures that it doesn't show up in your browser history (and URL autocomplete) if someone else is looking through your computer. Eventually Google plans to mark all standard HTTP pages as "Not secure" in red, as it does today for HTTPS sites which fail the security check. So anyone who runs a website needs to start thinking about upgrading to HTTPS. Do you check for the HTTPS security padlock when entering data into webpages? What other tricks do you use to guard your security and privacy online? This article originally appeared in Digital Life, The Sydney Morning Herald's home for everything technology.

Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus May 5, 2017, 11:24am Certificate authorities have infrastructure and audit costs. You're also paying to some degree for the CA's reputation - there's nothing stopping you from running your own CA and providing certificates for free, but odds are people will trust "Pformagg" a lot less than "Verisign" as the signing authority. Reply 0 james @james May 5, 2017, 11:50am WHM can now generate them for free. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus May 5, 2017, 12:00pm If you're referring to self-signed certificates, I thought that had been available in WHM for a while. The problem is they're not certified by a trusted CA so browsers tend to give users very visible warnings, which you don't want for any kind of professional website. Reply 0 Cameron @moonhead May 5, 2017, 12:41pm For basic certificates, they can be - https://letsencrypt.org/ If you need things like EV for online shopping/banking, you still need to pay for those, but as you're now making money off your website, not just using it as a way to display information, that's more a cost of running that webstore. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus May 5, 2017, 2:08pm Fair enough, I forgot about them. They don't support wildcard certificates so I mentally wrote them off a while ago. Reply 0 ssl user Guest May 5, 2017, 1:01pm They are - see https://letsencrypt.org/ Reply 0 Cameron @moonhead May 5, 2017, 12:44pm I found it very amusing that the original site this appears on (SMH/The Age), doesn't actually support SSL properly as well. Their comment forms are submitted over plain HTTP, which will trigger these warnings in Chrome soon (and rightly so). Also, if you try to access the site through HTTPS it doesn't work as the certificates have not been correctly issued for their CDN. Perhaps they should get their own house in order before writing articles like this? Reply 1 superbird @hotfootdarth May 5, 2017, 1:21pm Apparently, not all certificates are created equal. When I go to some sites and hover the mouse over the little 'i' symbol in the address bar, it says 'This website only has domain validation issued by Comodo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA'. It is https but without the padlock. Beats me. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Adobe software has always been expensive, but at least it was one upfront cost. As it turns out, we were right. Another annual price increase for Creative Cloud is happening a month from now, and it represents the latest jump in a nearly 250 per cent price rise for some Creative Cloud plans since it started. Microsoft's Surface Laptop: The Gizmodo Hands On Alex Cranz 03 May 2017 12:30 PM The Surface Laptop might not have turned many heads if it had been the first mobile computer from Microsoft. It's not as radical and influential as the Surface Pro or as crazy looking as the Surface Book. From afar the silver Surface Laptop looks like something as easily made by Apple or Asus as by Microsoft. It feels like that too, with the same heft as a powerful premium laptop like the 2016 MacBook Pro or the exceptional Asus ZenBook 3. Despite being a good looking hunk of hardware, the Surface Laptop is remarkable for how perfectly mundane it in light of recent Microsoft computer products. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Most Google users are by now aware of the phishing e-mail scam that took place Wednesday, which many security experts called “sophisticated,” various news sources reported. A day after the attack, Google has rolled out a new safeguard to its Android Gmail app.   The phishing scam attempted to hack a user’s Google account after the user clicks a link that appears to be from a trusted individual. Google was able to stop the attack after about 1 million (just 0.1 percent) of all Gmail users had seen one of the e-mails. Now with the Gmail app updates, when a phony link appears in an e-mail, Google will warn the user, with an alert: “The site you are trying to visit has been identified as a forgery intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal or other sensitive information.” The company recommends Google users affected by the attack to change their passwords and report the attack.

Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. By: Reuters | Los Angeles | Published:May 5, 2017 6:59 am In December 2015, San Bernardino County health inspector Farook and his Pakistan-born wife Malik opened fire on a meeting of Farook’s colleagues, and were killed in a shootout with police. Family members of San Bernardino terror attack victims are suing Facebook, Google and Twitter for providing platforms to aid terrorists. (AP Photo) Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided “material support” to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. “For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,” family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook’s co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

Not long after, Google announced an Gmail for Android feature to fight phishing scams. Google is adding anti-phishing security checks to Gmail for Android. With it, you’ll get a “phishing suspected” warning when you click a suspicious link in your email. The warning explains that the site you’re trying to visit has been identified as a forgery, but it will let you continue if you believe it to be a false warning. This new feature is now rolling out, though it could take a few days to hit all users.  Google’s anti-phishing security check is a nice addition to Gmail for Android. Not everyone is technically savvy enough to identify phishing scams on their own, and so this new warning can help protect folks that might fall victim to a scam without them.

EDT May 04, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The scam confirmed by Google on Wednesday, where creators apparently targeted the company's G-Mail account holders, is reportedly contained. For some account holders, the problem is just beginning, because their accounts - and possibly their computers' entire operating systems - might be compromised. "An email was sent out to people that didn't expect it," said Senior Information Technologies Security Analyst Jeff Gouge at University of North Florida on Thursday. "That basically said 'You have a new Google document'." Making the worm email all the more stealthy, it was designed to indicate that the document had been suggested by a known source, such as a personal friend. "In the end, what it was trying to do was take over your email, so that [the hackers] could use it to spread the virus," Gouge continued. Gouge said viruses are constantly being written, sometimes only to glorify the ego of their creators. Often, it's created to steal personal information for later sale, or steal passwords, which creates an even greater vulnerability. The strategy, says Gouge, is to make you click before you think. His counter-strategy is simple, if sweeping. "Don't click links in an email," he summarized. "If it's an email from your bank, and it says 'Click this link to see your statement,' instead of doing that, just open up a new tab or browser, and just go to your favorites, go type it in yourself." As soon as you click, you're often already compromised, he said. If so, Gouge recommends three steps: 1) Change your password 2) Notify the vendor (e.g. Google) and follow instructions from that vendor 3) Re-install your operating system (e.g. Windows or Macintosh) The problem with re-installing is that you might lose plenty of wanted, but unsaved data in the process. "Backing up to a Cloud of some kind, backing up to another device or another computer," Gouge said is the best way to retain most or all wanted data ahead of any compromise. In the instance of the "Google Docs" hack, Gouge says Google has reportedly fixed the leak, but he warns that because of the constant threat posed by hackers, taking the aforementioned steps can help you protect your privacy and finances. © 2017 WTLV-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Video goes viral of IUD device in baby's hand Verify: Photo gone viral!

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Rooted Google Pixel, Pixel XL lose root access with May security update, Chainfir details fix By John Hoff - May 4, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google has just released the Android Security Bulletin for May, and it did something unexpected with Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones rooted using Chainfire’s SuperSU – that is, the May security update caused these phones to lose root access. The legendary developer details what went wrong, and how to fix it. The reason that these Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones lost root access, according to Chainfire who did some digging for the issue, is due to the fact that the bootloader included in the May 2017 security update no longer accepts flashing unsigned boot images. Of course, root via SuperSU would require to flash the bootloader – so the problem is there, and root access was nullified. Chainfire said that there is a fix. Google appears to be using Android Verified Boot (AVB) to verify that boot images are signed. The developer has given detailed steps for developers to generate their own custom signing keys so that users on the Pixel and Pixel XL with the May security update can enjoy root access. You can check the official thread and post of Chainfire on XDA, so that you can get root access back again on your Google Pixel. This will entail some developer knowledge on your end. Or, you can just wait for these devs – including Chainfire – to publish a fix that you can easily use.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 74 Plus 1 on G+ 313 Share on Facebook 119 Share on Twitter Total Shares506 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup USA Europe Asia Africa Middle East The Americas World Google Doodle celebrates 100th anniversary of Giro d'Italia Cyclists cover more than 170km per day in gruelling Tour of Italy. By Rachel Middleton May 5, 2017 01:59 BST Google Doodle marks the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia which kicks off on 5 May 2017Google doodle Google Doodle has marked the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia, or Tour of Italy, with a tribute to its mountainous route. Featuring cyclists labouring up the gruelling mountainous climb, it also has a few whizzing past on some less taxing hills, with a bright yellow sun in the background. And one cannot have the Giro d'Italia without a picture of a cyclist in the coveted and maglia rosa, or pink jersey, which is bestowed on the rider with the best combined time across all the preceding stages. The 2017 Tour of Italy will see a total of 22 international teams compete for three weeks. The scenic route that takes cyclists in their gruelling journey will pass through small towns and cover a total of 3,615km over 22 stages. The race offers six stages for sprinters, eight medium-mountain stages and five high-mountain stages. And it offers three rest days to facilitate the additional travel time needed. It also has two individual time trials. This effectively means cyclists will be covering an average of 171.7km a day. The race will kick off with an opening stage through Sardinia on 5 May and end on 28 May. "The Giro is especially well known for its mountain stages, where riders labour up long, gruelling climbs, then zoom down the other side (at up to 110km/h) on twisting alpine roads," Google says. Leaders in the four categories of the race will be awarded specially-coloured jerseys but the most coveted remains the maglia rosa. Google wishes Andiamo! and Forza! to all the racers and the spectators at the 100th Giro d'Italia. The first ever race took place on 13th May 1909 when 127 cyclists took part in the race. And the 100th race in 2017 will finish in Milan which also hosted the Grande Partenza and the conclusion of the first ever race in 1909. Controversies Michele Scarponi has died after being run over by a truck while training in ItalyReuters The 100th race has not been without controversy. The organiser, RCS Sport withdrew its short-lived classification of measuring cyclists on certain descents through the race, with a €5,000 prize offer for the person with the fastest overall time on the downhills. The new classification did not go down well, and the organiser subsequently decided to cancel the classification, saying: "The spirit of the initiative was to highlight an important skill which is an integral part of a cycle race without putting the riders' safety in jeopardy. Rider safety is, and remains, the priority of the Giro and race organisers." Although there will not be a cash award, the times for the fastest descent will still be kept, "for the fans," the organisers said. And on 22 April, professional cyclist and one-time Giro d'Italia winner Michele Scarponi was killed by a truck at a crossroads in Filottrano, in the central Le March region. The 37-year-old cyclist was training and was on his way home when he was hit. Scarponi, a member of the Astana race team since 2014, finished the Tour of the Alps in Trento just the day before on 21 April. He won the Giro d'Italia in 2011.

It’s called “woven technology,” or tech that’s woven right into fabric. Tech giant Google has partnered with the original jeans-maker Levi’s to showcase just how this technology could change everyday life. This partnership marks an inflection point in wearables. The launch of the Apple Watch was a watershed moment, marking the mainstreaming of wearables. Yet the sales numbers were not astronomical – the new product line generated only $1.7 billion for Apple in fiscal year 2015. Rather than ring the death knell for wearables, fashion is now pushing the category further. The promise of a new revolution driven by technology-integrated clothing is intoxicating. The latest example of wearable fashion moving from experimental to practical is Google and Levi’s new Trucker Jacket. The jacket infuses Google’s Project Jacquard technology into the jacket, which then acts as an interface for a smartphone tucked away in a biker’s pocket. In travel, this could be a revolution that increases operational efficiency of front-line staff while also boosting accuracy of the behind-the-scenes crews moving the industry forward every day. Levi’s and Google might just be on to something: here are four ways that woven tech could save travel suppliers money while enhancing the traveler experience in new and innovative ways. De-clustering customer support staff The introduction of tablets to the customer service workflow liberated staff from desks and led to the now-familiar “roving” customer service representative. Whether it’s the Virgin agent wearing Google Glass or the hotel clerk checking guests in on an iPad strapped to his wrist, technology has made customer service mobile. Google Glass even promised a new level of personalization for passengers in an experimental application with Virgin. Woven technology holds a similar promise. Uniforms come with built-in interfaces that connect to specific systems, liberating data and empowering front-line customer support staff. Rather than limit the customer service function to one area of the enterprise, the ubiquitous uniforms expand the scope and definition of customer support. Employees become hosts and brand ambassadors regardless of title. For example, a hotel experiencing a rush of incoming guests could temporarily re-assign a concierge or bellman to work the line. With the PMS right there on the sleeve, the employee can jump right in. And as the trend shifts to self check-in, the employee mix will shift to be more general support.The guest will walk straight to the door, and simply “sleeve in” to the room. Real-time data dispersal Embedded wearables liberate data from silos, bringing data to the employee in a direct and portable fashion. The employee benefits from real-time information pushed right to the uniform, and the durability of woven technology reduces costs associated with tech breakage. For example, a baggage handler can scan tags without a handheld barcode reader, or a wing walker could use her arms as the light cones for guiding planes to and from gates — while enjoying better visibility at night due to embedded LEDs. An airline could partner to create a fashion-forward accessory for flight attendants that shares all passenger information on a touch-responsive sleeve. Rather than walk the aisle asking first class passengers what they’d like for dinner, attendants could see exactly what meal each passenger had selected before boarding. Traveler experience is improved, as is operational efficiency. One existing concept of using wearables to personalize the travel experience is the “Happiness Blanket” from British Airways. The blanket translates passengers’ brainwaves into a color-coded representation of their state-of-mind. Woven tech facilitates this sort of “soft” customer service, allowing employees to adapt quickly and accurately to customers’ well-being. Reinvigorating the travel consultant Travel consultants often seek new ways of engaging with clients, especially during a journey. The proliferation of messaging services has increased complexity when communicating with clients; woven technology could bring this communication right to the traveler’s sleeve while in destination. This connection means that a consultant could quickly route updated information to the traveler and then use soft vibrations to alert the customer of a change in itinerary. Or the consultant dives into deep personalization through the use of wearable itineraries. The consultant, often an expert in the places being visited by the client, builds itineraries that deliver directions, background, and personal recommendations to clients. With GPS, these itineraries would prompt and nudge the traveler when a recommended experience is nearby. Improving the speed and accuracy of security A sensor embedded in luggage includes a unique code identifying that bag. Rather than rely on paper bag tags, each bag is simply tied to a PNR. This bag could be registered by different people; each time, the bag is registered to that new PNR and tracked. This gives security screeners a new level of data about a bag’s history, while also assuring travelers of the bag’s location at all times via a traveler-facing app integration. Barcode scanning could shift from having to rely on the smartphone, with either a sleeve- or skin-based interface eliminating the need to hand over an expensive smartphone. Passports already contain small chips embedded with traveler data, so an embedded sensor specific to travel could even replace ID altogether. Similar to PreCheck, travelers could purchase a line of garments that eliminates the need for ID through uniquely coded embedded chips. Realistically… There’s something intriguing about the personal touch of engaging with a digital interface on a textured surface. This woven interface suggests a new dimension of “bespoke itineraries” in travel, where a tailored fit happens twice: once upon purchasing a garment and then again when the garment personalizes the digital experience. Of course, like all emerging technologies, there will be certain use cases that are more economically viable than others. If the fashion remains elusive to the mainstream, then the impact remains niche to the luxury traveler. Standards also come into play, as any embedded sensor must be interoperable with others. A true wearable interface would also need to offer a larger screen with little interference due to fabric type. Regardless of use, the fashion designers and the technologists have come together to infuse technology in one of the last untouched realms of modern society: right into the fabric on our backs. And as the cost of chips go down and processing power goes up, the sky’s the limit as far as imagining just how technology could weave into the fabric of our travel experience.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Nick Vivion Nick Vivion is a writer and strategist.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Associated Press Share Comment Read Article MILAN — Italian tax officials say Google has agreed to pay $335 million to settle an ongoing tax dispute. Google has been under investigation by Milan prosecutors for the tax years 2009-2013, one of several European probes looking into the tax practices of international companies. Italian tax officials said the settlement announced Thursday also launches a process to determine the tech company’s proper taxation level in Italy going forward. The agreement covers the period under investigation, as well as 2014-2015 and 2002-2006. Google said it remained committed to Italy. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

One security researcher has already managed to replicate it, even as Google is trying to protect users from such attacks. “It looks exactly like the original spoof,” said Matt Austin, director of security research at Contrast Security. The phishing scheme -- which may have circulated to 1 million Gmail users -- is particularly effective because it fooled users with a dummy app that looked like Google Docs. Recipients who received the email were invited to click a blue box that said “Open in Docs.” Those who did were brought to an actual Google account page that asks them to handover Gmail access to the dummy app. While fooling users with spoofed emails is nothing new, Wednesday’s attack involved an actual third-party app made with real Google processes. The company’s developer platform can enable anyone to create web-based apps. In this case, the culprit chose to name the app “Google Docs” in an effort to trick users. The search company has shut down the attack by removing the app. It’s also barred other developers from using “Google” in naming their third-party apps. However, Austin found he could still reproduce Wednesday’s phishing scheme. He did so, by using the search company’s developer platform to create his own third-party app, and also called it “Google Docs.” Michael Kan Security researcher Matt Austin replicated Wednesday's phishing attack using Cyrillic script. The only difference is that Austin used a Cyrillic character, used in Russia, for the letter “o” in his app’s name. “The Cyrillic letter o looks exactly like the other letter o,” Austin said. He then replicated the rest of the Wednesday’s attack, creating a fake email that uses the same design interface. Austin has submitted the security issue to Google, and now its developer platform no longer accepts apps under that name. However, he and other security experts predict that bad actors are also working on replicating Wednesday’s attack. “There’s no question that this will be repeated again,” said Ayse Kaya, a director at Cisco Cloudlock Cyberlabs, a security provider. “It will probably happen much more often.” More traditional phishing email schemes can strike by tricking users into giving up their login credentials. However, Wednesday’s attack takes a different approach and abuses what’s known as the OAuth protocol, a convenient way for internet accounts to link with third-party applications. Through OAuth, users don’t have to hand over any password information. They instead grant permission so that one third-party app can connect to their internet account, at say, Google, Facebook or Twitter. But like any technology, OAuth can be exploited. Back in 2011, one developer even warned that the protocol could be used in a phishing attack with apps that impersonate Google services. Nevertheless, OAuth has become a popular standard used across IT. CloudLock has found that over 276,000 apps use the protocol through services like Google, Facebook and Microsoft Office 365. What aided Wednesday’s phishing scheme was that Google’s own services didn’t do enough to point out it came from a suspicious developer, said Aaron Parecki, an IT consultant who helps businesses implement OAuth. For instance, the dummy Google Docs app was registered to a developer at eugene.pupov@gmail.com -- a red flag that the product wasn’t real. However, the dummy app still managed to fool users because Google’s own account permission page never plainly listed the developer’s information, unless the user clicks the page to find out, Parecki said. Cloudlock The developer behind the fake Google Docs app only appears if you mouse over the product informaiton. “I was surprised Google didn’t show much identifying information with these apps,” he said. “It’s a great example of what can go wrong.” Rather than hide those details, all of it should be shown to users, Parecki said. Austin agreed, and said apps that ask for permission to Gmail should include a more blatant warning over what the user is handing over. “I’m not on the OAuth hate bandwagon yet. I do see it as valuable,” Austin said. “But there are some risks with it.” Fortunately, Google was able to quickly foil Wednesday’s attack, and is introducing “anti-abuse systems” to prevent it from happening again. Users who might have been affected can do a Google security checkup to review what apps are connected to their accounts. The company’s Gmail Android app is also introducing a new security feature to warn users about possible phishing attempts. It's tempting to install apps and assume they're safe. But users and businesses need to be careful when linking accounts to third-party apps, which might be asking for more access than they need, Cloudlock's Kaya said. "Hackers have a headstart exploiting this attack," she said. "All companies need to be thinking about this."

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Aurora Innovation Joins Pittsburgh's Self-Driving Tech Industry The company has quietly opened an office in Pittsburgh, basing about half its staff there and half in Palo Alto, Calif. by Aaron Aupperlee, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review / May 4, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- Another self-driving car company has rolled into Pittsburgh. It's headed by autonomous driving veterans and leaders from three undisputed heavyweights in the field: Tesla, Google and Uber. But you probably haven't heard of them. RELATEDHow Pittsburgh Built an Agile Product ShopUber Has Big(ger) Plans for Autonomous Testing in PittsburghSelf-Driving Ubers Return to Pittsburgh Aurora Innovation was started by Sterling Anderson, the former director of Autopilot; Chris Urmson, the former CTO of Google's self-driving car efforts, and Drew Bagnell, who headed autonomy and perception at Uber's Advanced Technology Center in Pittsburgh. Chris Urmson, Drew Bagnell and Sterling Anderson The company has quietly opened an office in Pittsburgh, basing about half its staff here and half in Palo Alto, Calif. Aurora's car, a 2017 Audi Q7, recently drove from Silicon Valley to the Steel City, collecting nearly 3,000 miles of data along the way that it's using to refine its self-driving models. "We see Pittsburgh talent as a key strategic element of the autonomy puzzle and wanted to make sure our footprint reflected that," Anderson told the Tribune-Review in one of the few interviews he's given about the new company. Anderson was hesitant to reveal some details about Aurora's activities in Pittsburgh. He wouldn't say how many people are based here or where the office is located. What isn't a secret is Pittsburgh's growing self-driving ecosystem. Carnegie Mellon University has been at it for decades. It's been nearly a year since Uber announced it was actively testing autonomous vehicles on the city's streets and in that time, several self-driving companies have set up shop. Delphi is testing its technology on Pittsburgh's streets. Argo AI headquartered its offices in the Strip District after it received $1 billion from Ford. And companies like Edge Case Research have flourished to support the industry. Urmson and Bagnell pioneered work on autonomous vehicles at CMU. Urmson was director of technology on the university's 2007 team that won the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Grand Challenge. Bagnell was a member of that team. Urmson went to Google a year later to lead the company's self-driving car project. Bagnell remained at CMU as an associate professor in the university's Robotics Institute. In 2016, he went to Uber's Advanced Technology Center. Anderson worked on self-driving technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. Urmson took notice of his work and invited him to Google to talk to his autonomous vehicle team. Anderson ended up at Tesla, where he headed the Model X project and the company's Autopilot program. The three kept in touch and founded Aurora about four months ago. They've stayed relatively quiet about their company. In January, Tesla sued Aurora, Anderson and Urmson. Tesla withdrew the lawsuit less than three months later and a Santa Clara County, Calif., judge dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning Tesla can't re-file it. The lawsuit alleged Anderson tried to recruit Tesla engineers to Aurora Innovation in violation of his non-solicitation agreement with his former company. It also accused Anderson of taking confidential Tesla information and destroying evidence to cover it up. Anderson and Aurora disputed the allegations all along and pointed to Tesla withdrawing the suit even before the first court date as proof there was nothing to it. Aurora won't solicit Tesla employees until February, which the company couldn't do because of Anderson's original non-solicitation agreement with the company, and Aurora will reimburse Tesla $100,000 for an independent forensic audit of Aurora. Anderson said the Tesla lawsuit won't affect the company moving forward. The company has about $6.1 million in self-funding and from close advisors. It plans to launch a substantial funding round this year. Aurora has nine positions listed on its website. All are in Pittsburgh and Palo Alto. Anderson sees Aurora developing and designing the hardware, software and data analytic systems for auto manufacturers to integrate into their production models. Aurora will work with auto parts suppliers and manufacturers to make sure everything works together, Anderson said. Think of Aurora's role in the auto industry as similar to Microsoft's in the PC industry. Microsoft designed and developed Windows and then worked with PC companies to integrate it in the systems. "Players should play their positions," Anderson said, meaning that Aurora will let automakers do what they're good at, making cars, and will look for camera and sensor companies that are good at that. Aurora will likely write its own software. Aurora expects to start testing its cars in Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley later this year. But don't expect to see an Aurora car or the company's logo on the hood of sedans at the dealership. Just like you might not know what company made the airbag or stereo in your car now, you also might not know that Aurora is behind the self-driving tech.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Intel Partners With BMW on Self-Driving Car System The company expects this foray into autonomous driving to leverage and bolster Intel’s strengths. by Ethan Baron, The Mercury News / May 4, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- SAN JOSE — Semiconductor titan Intel has officially jumped into the self-driving car frenzy, throwing itself into battle with Google spinoff Waymo, Apple and a host of other firms. “That is an arms race going on,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University focused on autonomous driving. “I don’t think they are late, but they have to execute, of course.” In an event for press and analysts Wednesday at its “Innovation Campus” in San Jose, Intel unveiled a sleek silver BMW sedan showcasing Intel’s partnership with the German automaker and the computer vision company Mobileye that Intel is buying. RELATEDIntel to Break into Virtual Reality, Autonomous VehiclesIntel Acquires Mobileye, Makes $15 Billion Bet on Self-Driving VehiclesColorado Taps Intel Exec to Lead State Broadband Office The partnership is intended to let Intel develop a “base functionality platform” for self-driving cars that it would license to car makers, said Intel spokeswoman Marcie Miller. The Santa Clara firm’s move comes as its business has been on the upswing after it missed the mobile-computing revolution and saw PC sales falter before it pivoted toward cloud computing and development of 5G wireless networks. Autonomous cars represent another new frontier in technology markets. “It’s very wise for them to diversify,” Rajkumar said. Intel’s semiconductor chips would act as the “brains” for an autonomous-driving system, Miller said. The chips would process data from vehicles’ sensors within the vehicle, as well as in Intel’s self-driving system, and for processing autonomous-vehicle data in the cloud, Miller said. The foray into autonomous driving will leverage and bolster Intel’s strengths, including its data centers, its work on 5G networks, and its processors, said Kathy Winter, vice-president of the firm’s Automated Driving Group. “It plays well to all of the things that we are already doing, and it’s another way to extend those businesses,” Winter said. Or, as AutoPacific analyst George Peterson said, “it’s a way to sell chips.” Intel’s gambit puts it up against companies from a variety of technology sector, analysts said. “One of their primary competitors is going to be Waymo, of course, they’re well ahead,” Peterson said. Another rival will be Apple, which probably won’t build a car but instead produce autonomous-driving software and possibly some hardware modules, Peterson said. In an additional arena of competition, Intel will do battle with companies like Bosch making components for self-driving systems, and in yet another competitive realm, Intel will strive against companies with expertise in mapping — including Google, Magellan and TomTom — that’s crucial to autonomous driving systems, Peterson said. Car makers like Ford and GM also represent competition for Intel’s self-driving efforts, along with Uber, which is testing autonomous vehicles, and smaller firms such as Aurora Innovation, co-founded by Google’s former self-driving project head Chris Urmson, Rajkumar said. Another chipmaker, Santa Clara’s NVIDIA, will put additional competitive pressure on Intel, via NVIDIA processors used within autonomous cars — including all Teslas sold in the last six months — and for processing self-driving vehicle data in the cloud, said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. Whether a dominant autonomous-driving player will emerge with a widely used platform, or whether car makers will pull technology from a variety of sources remains to be seen, Peterson said. The BMW 740i showcased Wednesday is a prototype for the “iNext” electric car that BMW plans to put on the market in 2021, with self-driving capabilities falling somewhere between mostly driving itself but needing human backup, and full autonomy, said BMW advanced technology engineer Kyle Moy. Intel in November announced a partnership with Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye, and in March, it announced it was buying the company for about $15 billion. It is Mobileye’s machine-vision technology that will act as the “eyes” of the BMW prototype. Intel, by its own admission, missed the mobile revolution. And with the company netting more than half its sales from shipment of PCs as of 2016, five straight years of falling PC sales led Intel last year to announce it would cut 12,000 jobs and focus on chips for the cloud and Internet-connected devices. However, Intel’s fortunes have swung upward of late, with CEO Brian Krzanich in the company’s latest earnings report highlighting record first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, and looking toward self-driving car technology. ©2017 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)

(Reuters/San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department/Handout, File) LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State terrorists to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided “material support” to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. “For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,” family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google, the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook’s co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist terrorists. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at a club in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016, the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users.

Twitter Facebook Google Docs phishing attack underscores OAuth security risks One security researcher easily managed to replicate Wednesday's phishing attack Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 05 May, 2017 09:20 - - - - print email Comments Google has stopped Wednesday’s clever email phishing scheme, but the attack may very well make a comeback. One security researcher has already managed to replicate it, even as Google is trying to protect users from such attacks. “It looks exactly like the original spoof,” said Matt Austin, director of security research at Contrast Security. The phishing scheme -- which may have circulated to 1 million Gmail users -- is particularly effective because it fooled users with a dummy app that looked like Google Docs. Recipients who received the email were invited to click a blue box that said “Open in Docs.” Those who did were brought to an actual Google account page that asks them to handover Gmail access to the dummy app. While fooling users with spoofed emails is nothing new, Wednesday’s attack involved an actual third-party app made with real Google processes. The company’s developer platform can enable anyone to create web-based apps. In this case, the culprit chose to name the app “Google Docs” in an effort to trick users. The search company has shut down the attack by removing the app. It’s also barred other developers from using “Google” in naming their third-party apps. However, Austin found he could still reproduce Wednesday’s phishing scheme. He did so, by using the search company’s developer platform to create his own third-party app, and also called it “Google Docs.” Michael Kan Security researcher Matt Austin replicated Wednesday's phishing attack using Cyrillic script. The only difference is that Austin used a Cyrillic character, used in Russia, for the letter “o” in his app’s name. “The Cyrillic letter o looks exactly like the other letter o,” Austin said. He then replicated the rest of the Wednesday’s attack, creating a fake email that uses the same design interface. Austin has submitted the security issue to Google, and now its developer platform no longer accepts apps under that name. However, he and other security experts predict that bad actors are also working on replicating Wednesday’s attack. “There’s no question that this will be repeated again,” said Ayse Kaya, a director at Cisco Cloudlock Cyberlabs, a security provider. “It will probably happen much more often.” More traditional phishing email schemes can strike by tricking users into giving up their login credentials. However, Wednesday’s attack takes a different approach and abuses what’s known as the OAuth protocol, a convenient way for internet accounts to link with third-party applications. Through OAuth, users don’t have to hand over any password information. They instead grant permission so that one third-party app can connect to their internet account, at say, Google, Facebook or Twitter. But like any technology, OAuth can be exploited. Back in 2011, one developer even warned that the protocol could be used in a phishing attack with apps that impersonate Google services. Nevertheless, OAuth has become a popular standard used across IT. CloudLock has found that over 276,000 apps use the protocol through services like Google, Facebook and Microsoft Office 365. What aided Wednesday’s phishing scheme was that Google’s own services didn’t do enough to point out it came from a suspicious developer, said Aaron Parecki, an IT consultant who helps businesses implement OAuth. For instance, the dummy Google Docs app was registered to a developer at eugene.pupov@gmail.com -- a red flag that the product wasn’t real. However, the dummy app still managed to fool users because Google’s own account permission page never plainly listed the developer’s information, unless the user clicks the page to find out, Parecki said. Cloudlock The developer behind the fake Google Docs app only appears if you mouse over the product informaiton. “I was surprised Google didn’t show much identifying information with these apps,” he said. “It’s a great example of what can go wrong.” Rather than hide those details, all of it should be shown to users, Parecki said. Austin agreed, and said apps that ask for permission to Gmail should include a more blatant warning over what the user is handing over. “I’m not on the OAuth hate bandwagon yet. I do see it as valuable,” Austin said. “But there are some risks with it.” Fortunately, Google was able to quickly foil Wednesday’s attack, and is introducing “anti-abuse systems” to prevent it from happening again. Users who might have been affected can do a Google security checkup to review what apps are connected to their accounts. The company’s Gmail Android app is also introducing a new security feature to warn users about possible phishing attempts. It's tempting to install apps and assume they're safe. But users and businesses need to be careful when linking accounts to third-party apps, which might be asking for more access than they need, Cloudlock's Kaya said. "Hackers have a headstart exploiting this attack," she said. "All companies need to be thinking about this."

Facebook reported on Wednesday that 98 percent of its quarterly revenue came from advertising, up from 97 percent a year earlier and 84 percent in 2012. Revenue from non-advertising sources fell to $175 million in the quarter, from $181 million a year earlier. Facebook has warned for some time about declining non-ad revenue. That part of its business consists almost entirely of video game players on desktop computers buying virtual currency, and it has fallen as gaming has moved to smartphones. Facebook takes 30 percent of purchases, with the balance going to companies such as Zynga Inc, maker of the game Farmville. The company's dependence on advertising is a long-term concern but it has time to find other revenue while building its core ad business, said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. "We have to remember it's still a fairly young business. It's not like they're an old-fashioned business that needs to move soon," he said. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment. Facebook's share price hit an all-time high of $153.60 on Tuesday before dipping to close at $150.85 on Thursday. The lack of diversification stands in contrast to Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. Its non-advertising revenue, from sources such as cloud services and Pixel smartphones, posted a 49.4 percent jump to $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter and now represents 13 percent of Google's total revenue, up from 10 percent a year earlier. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said during a conference call in February that the company was diversifying revenue by expanding its base of advertisers across geographic regions and industries. Facebook's non-advertising products, such as its Oculus virtual reality headset and the Workplace office software, currently generate little revenue. Some companies diversify through acquisitions, but most of Facebook's purchases such as Instagram and WhatsApp have been in adjacent markets. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in a conference call for investors on Wednesday that Facebook was not breaking out Instagram revenue as a separate line in financial reports because Instagram ads are sold through the same interface as Facebook ads.

When the Apple Watch launched, one of its most promising features was its app support. The App Store, after all, had been a key factor in the iPhone becoming all conquering, and there was a real chance of kickstarting a wearable revolution with the same trick. Well, maybe not, it turns out. While the Apple Watch is still the most popular wearable around, it's a small pond that isn't growing much. Worse, it appears that a number of high profile apps are withdrawing their support for the small screen. Apple Insider has spotted a number of apps – including Google Maps, Amazon and eBay – that have quietly withdrawn support for the Apple Watch. While Google has said that the company “expect to support it again in the future”, for now the Maps feature which sends directions straight to the wrist has been removed without explanation in the release notes. Amazon and eBay both removed Apple Watch support from their respective iOS apps in April, too. While I imagine nobody will cry for the loss of the Amazon wrist shopping, missing notifications when you're outbid on eBay could prove a touch more infuriating. American retailer Target, Apple Insider notes, has also removed Apple Watch support, though their standalone Cartwheel app still supports the wearable.   What does all this mean? Well, the most likely explanation is that nobody is using the features, making it a bit pointless to waste time and resources supporting them through each Apple Watch and iOS update. It's important to note that's not the same thing as the Apple Watch being an unappealing product – just that the original use case Apple envisaged wasn't matched by real world behaviour. Regular people almost always use technology in a way that's more basic than innovators would like. Reluctantly, it seems that the app creators are paring back their ambitions to match how real people use their services in the real world, where technology is just means to an end rather than the universal answer to everything.

It launched as a pretty rough-around-the-edges beta and has pretty much stayed that way ever since. Then, at CES, we were told that these apps would become more official alongside the launch of the Samsung Chromebook Pro — in April. Check the calendar there, friends: it’s May now. I don’t know if the two delays are related, but I suspect the bigger issue here isn’t Samsung, it’s Google. We did a deep dive on the state of Android apps on Chrome OS back in February and our takeaway: they are very far from ready. There were a multitude of issues that needed solving. Apps were jittery, broken, and most of all looked bad on big screens. Looking at more recent Chromebooks, little has changed on all of those fronts. It makes sense that Google is taking some extra time to ensure that Android apps on Chrome OS are a better experience. For one, it’s not good enough to ship half-finished products and call them baked. For two, the pressure on Chrome OS to deliver something new and good is higher than it’s ever been: Microsoft just finished unveiling an all-new version of Windows designed specifically to take on Chrome OS in the education market. Microsoft has app problems of its own, of course, but the competition in the cheap laptop space is getting really serious. Google can’t afford to take its lead in the education space for granted. When Android apps do finally leave beta, they’re hopefully going to be based on Android Nougat. That will allow for apps to be resized to any window size you like instead of limiting them to just tablet or phone layouts. Of course, we also need apps that actually look good at multiple sizes — and getting developers to recode their apps for that has been a challenge (to say the least) for Google. Even some of Google’s own apps still don’t look all that great on tablet-sized screens. One thing to note: even if you’re not running a beta version of Chrome OS, you might still have Android apps available on your machine. Until fairly recently, to get the Google Play Store and its Android apps running on Chrome OS, you had to join the “Beta” channel. But now several Chromebooks have it available in the more mainstream “stable” channel. But that doesn’t mean Android apps on Chrome OS are out of beta. Google has a whole chart about which Chromebooks support Android apps here — it was updated a little over a week ago. As for the Samsung Chromebook Pro, I don’t see any good reason for it to be delayed based on the hardware. We know that Samsung made a last-minute decision to switch the Pro’s color from silver to black, but otherwise nothing about the preproduction unit we looked at a few months ago was problematic. The stylus worked well, the machines were fast, and battery life was pretty good. Anyway, we reached out to Samsung for comment. A Samsung spokesperson emailed to say that the “Chromebook Pro will be available later this spring. Chromebook Plus is available for purchase online and in-store now.” We don’t know yet whether the release of the Chromebook Pro is still coupled to Android apps becoming official on Chrome OS. We do know that Google is going to need to bring it up at the big IO developer conference later this month. We also know that, technically, the last day of Spring this year is June 19th.

Google beefs up security in Android Gmail app following Docs phishing scam Trump administration is giving us a good lesson on Twitter security Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key Google has stopped Wednesday’s clever email phishing scheme, but the attack may very well make a comeback. One security researcher has already managed to replicate it, even as Google is trying to protect users from such attacks. “It looks exactly like the original spoof,” said Matt Austin, director of security research at Contrast Security. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] The phishing scheme -- which may have circulated to 1 million Gmail users -- is particularly effective because it fooled users with a dummy app that looked like Google Docs. Recipients who received the email were invited to click a blue box that said “Open in Docs.” Those who did were brought to an actual Google account page that asks them to handover Gmail access to the dummy app. While fooling users with spoofed emails is nothing new, Wednesday’s attack involved an actual third-party app made with real Google processes. The company’s developer platform can enable anyone to create web-based apps. In this case, the culprit chose to name the app “Google Docs” in an effort to trick users. The search company has shut down the attack by removing the app. It’s also barred other developers from using “Google” in naming their third-party apps. However, Austin found he could still reproduce Wednesday’s phishing scheme. He did so, by using the search company’s developer platform to create his own third-party app, and also called it “Google Docs.” Michael Kan Security researcher Matt Austin replicated Wednesday's phishing attack using Cyrillic script.  The only difference is that Austin used a Cyrillic character, used in Russia, for the letter “o” in his app’s name. “The Cyrillic letter o looks exactly like the other letter o,” Austin said. He then replicated the rest of the Wednesday’s attack, creating a fake email that uses the same design interface.   Austin has submitted the security issue to Google, and now its developer platform no longer accepts apps under that name. However, he and other security experts predict that bad actors are also working on replicating Wednesday’s attack. “There’s no question that this will be repeated again,” said Ayse Kaya, a director at Cisco Cloudlock Cyberlabs, a security provider. “It will probably happen much more often.” More traditional phishing email schemes can strike by tricking users into giving up their login credentials. However, Wednesday’s attack takes a different approach and abuses what’s known as the OAuth protocol, a convenient way for internet accounts to link with third-party applications. Through OAuth, users don’t have to hand over any password information. They instead grant permission so that one third-party app can connect to their internet account, at say, Google, Facebook or Twitter. But like any technology, OAuth can be exploited. Back in 2011, one developer even warned that the protocol could be used in a phishing attack with apps that impersonate Google services. Nevertheless, OAuth has become a popular standard used across IT. CloudLock has found that over 276,000 apps use the protocol through services like Google, Facebook and Microsoft Office 365. What aided Wednesday’s phishing scheme was that Google’s own services didn’t do enough to point out it came from a suspicious developer, said Aaron Parecki, an IT consultant who helps businesses implement OAuth. For instance, the dummy Google Docs app was registered to a developer at eugene.pupov@gmail.com -- a red flag that the product wasn’t real. However, the dummy app still managed to fool users because Google’s own account permission page never plainly listed the developer’s information, unless the user clicks the page to find out, Parecki said. Cloudlock The developer behind the fake Google Docs app only appears if you mouse over the product informaiton.  “I was surprised Google didn’t show much identifying information with these apps,” he said. “It’s a great example of what can go wrong.” Rather than hide those details, all of it should be shown to users, Parecki said.   Austin agreed, and said apps that ask for permission to Gmail should include a more blatant warning over what the user is handing over. “I’m not on the OAuth hate bandwagon yet. I do see it as valuable,” Austin said. “But there are some risks with it.” Fortunately, Google was able to quickly foil Wednesday’s attack, and is introducing “anti-abuse systems” to prevent it from happening again. Users who might have been affected can do a Google security checkup to review what apps are connected to their accounts. The company’s Gmail Android app is also introducing a new security feature to warn users about possible phishing attempts.   It's tempting to install apps and assume they're safe. But users and businesses need to be careful when linking accounts to third-party apps, which might be asking for more access than they need, Cloudlock's Kaya said.  "Hackers have a headstart exploiting this attack," she said. "All companies need to be thinking about this." To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

The relatives of victims of the San Bernardino shootings claim the tech giants have allowed ISIS to build a major online presence The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday at the US District court in Los Angeles by the families of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos, three of the 14 people gunned down on December 2, 2015 by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik. The couple targeted a Christmas party being held in a banqueting room at San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. Twenty-two other people were injured in the shooting. ‘For years, Defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group IS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits,’ reads the complaint, filed by lawyers Keith Altman and Theida Salazar.

Share this article Share ‘Even if Farook and Malik had never been directly in contact with IS, its use of social media directly influenced their actions on the day of the San Bernardino massacre,’ the lawsuit added. FBI Director James Comey said immediately after the shooting that although there was no evidence the couple was directed by a terrorist group, there were clues pointing to ‘potential inspiration by foreign terrorist organisations. ‘The Internet allows the opportunity for people to consume poison and radicalise,’ he added. The internet giants have faced growing outrage over the material they provide access to, including child abuse images and instructions for terrorist acts - which Google profited from through YouTube adverts - as well doing little to prevent online bullying. Syed Rizwan Farook, left, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, right, killed 14 people in the December 2015 shooting And this week Facebook bowed to pressure to crack down on live broadcasts of murders and suicides on the social network. The web giant is to hire 3,000 more staff to police what users post, joining 4,500 already in place to stamp out violence, hate speech and child abuse images. The company was forced to act after an outcry over a number of disturbing incidents broadcast via Facebook Live, its ‘streaming’ service that lets users put whatever they like directly on the network. A recent survey by the NSPCC found 80 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds believe social media firms fail to protect them from harmful content. According to the Los Angeles Times, the lawsuit contends the companies are liable for aiding and abetting acts of international terrorism, wrongful death and providing material support to a designated foreign terror group among other charges. The legal action mirrors similar lawsuits filed by families following deadly attacks at an Orlando nightclub last June and the slaying of five police officers in Dallas a month later. The father of a victim from the Paris massacre sued the same three companies for providing a platform to ISIS. A recent survey by the NSPCC found 80 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds believe social media firms fail to protect them from harmful content (stock image) The suits challenge the interpretation of the Communications Decency Act, a US law that states that Internet platforms are not liable for what their users post on their sites. While legal experts claim the lawsuit is unlikely to succeed in court and the statute has protected social media sites in the past, lawyers are claiming the secretive algorithms used to curate content can be open to abuse. In previous cases, Google, Facebook and Twitter have said they are sympathetic to victims of such attacks but are not liable for what happened. Asking for the Orlando lawsuit to be dismissed in court papers filed last week, the companies argued that accepting such an ‘unbounded theory’ behind the Pulse nightclub attack that left 49 dead ‘would have staggering consequences, exposing every online platform to possible liability for terrorist violence anywhere in the world, at any time, simply because terrorists who committed the attack may have been loosely affiliated with some of the platforms’ billions of users.’ A Facebook spokesperson said the company was ‘committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook. ‘Our Community Standards make clear that there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us. We sympathize with the victims and their families,’ the statement added. Twitter and Google have also said they are working to prohibit the promotion of terrorism. Among the initiatives is a shared industry database of unique digital ‘fingerprints’ linked to terrorism.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 21 shares Most watched News videos Cute orangutan is freed by rescuers after TWO YEARS in a box Shocking video shows family thrown off Delta flight in seat saga Great white shark circles boat off WA coast 'I can't stand up any more': Prince Philip jokes about retirement Caring motorist HUGS driver who nearly knocked him off his bike We sent a model out with a fake cold sore, will she be able to pull?

Reuters  | Posted by Sonalee Borgohain  reuters@intoday.com Los Angeles, May 5, 2017 | UPDATED 05:02 IST A +A - People holding photos of the victims during a moment of silence at a vigil in San Bernardino, California on December 7, 2015. (Photo: Reuters) Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. 14 PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES ON DECEMBER 2, 2015 Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on December 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, US-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on US soil since the September 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

[Is This Real?] Google Calendar's web interface should be getting a redesign in Q4 2017 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 5:33am PDTMay 4, 2017 56 Plus 1 on G+ 85 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares199 Google News Videos Folks, it's happening. Alright, it's not happening right now, but it should be happening soon. What every Google Calendar user has wanted for years, what every Google user who dared venture in the dark and murky waters of calendar.google.com has clamored for, what every piece of common sense has predicted: Google Calendar's web interface is getting a revamp. According to this roadmap of G Suite features that has appeared in a presentation from Google's Cloud NEXT 2017 event, Google Calendar has a "redesign of web interface" planned for Q4 2017. If that is what it exactly says it should be, then we will finally have that brand spanking new Calendar UI on the web that we've been dreaming of and that we can only achieve with themes and extensions right now. Below, you will find the entire slide of G Suite's usability features roadmap — check it out to see if there's something else planned that is interesting. I've also linked to the exact moment it shows up in the video of the "G Suite Product Roadmap — 2017 and beyond" presentation. (The video is from the EMEA satellite event with Dennis DeMeyere presenting, but it should be the same presentation as the one in San Francisco.) Nothing in here says "Material Design" or "new and shiny and colorful and clean and modern," so we can't jump to conclusions just yet. But at least we have hope that at some point in Q4 2017, Google Calendar on the web will look less like the lost bastard child of a 2013 one-night stand.

Yes, please! F4LL0U7 More reminder functionality, and let me guess, it won't integrate with Google Now, Keep, Calendar, or Inbox reminders? Maybe they'll introduce a new Gmail Messenger while they're at it... F4LL0U7 (I do realize this is most likely adding the ability to create reminders for certain emails that you don't want to fall off your radar, which I fully support!) catalysto This is exactly what Inbox is designed for. F4LL0U7 Right, but some of us just can't get into the Inbox interface, and would still like reminders on our emails. Cesar Cardoso "Gmail - create reminders. Yes, please!" And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE integrate with all the 70000 reminders on Google products. Even if it's more like "star on steriods", as F4LL0U7 speculates. The Swami i'd settle for something simple, like an actual usable recurring Tasks setup, instead of having to go out for other apps to integrate that functionality into Google Calendar (reminders are worthless to me for this). Unfortunately, Google puts in what Google wants, not what the customer wants. Geoff Johnson Since they love splitting one service into many, I wouldn't be surprised to see features stripped from Calendar and put into a separate app. Mark Curtis Another chat app. Midas Gordon-Farleigh With a bot that you can talk to to create an event. Leo Herzog Did you watch the video? That's literally a feature of their new Hangouts Chat product. Midas Gordon-Farleigh No, I didn't. Unfortunately, not being a GSuite user, I figured there probably wasn't much worth my time in that. That's a bit silly though. Sigh. Defenestratus I don't use calendar for work - but for my personal life it seems to work pretty well. Not sure what it is that people want out of a redesign. Sean Thomas that's the same for me but I only use the android app which is material already. if you go to the calendar website on desktop it's just kind of outdated compared to the app interface. Defenestratus Yeah I guess I can see that. I don't think the design ever really got in the way of my using the product though. The "Create Event" screen on the other hand... it needs some help. Suicide_Note My thoughts exactly. Dawid Kania Hi Rita! I can confirm that this redesign exists. What's even more interesting since yesterday I have access to it. (I'm a member of "New Google Calendar Web Trusted Tester Program" at my current company). We are a G Suite customer and have received invitations to join the trusted testers program on 26th of April. Nicholas Conrad Oops, just violated the trusted tester tos :/ Dawid Kania Hi Nicholas, Thanks for pointing that out. Not being aware of the tos doesn't mean I should assume there is none. My bad. Dan Well now I want to know what was said... Josh Flowers He said https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/72eaa756ce425ac019d0637e35838dcd5846e8e660c771d22950b13701f6eee4.jpg Nicholas Conrad I don't want a candy-coated calendar. Material design really does nothing for me, reminds me of: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/68423836fc3bc7576ed6e12686edeaa2f4b35db5c9c05a508d014f98b01e0b32.jpg Marcellus1 Disappointed the roadmap doesn't include more on Docs. It didn't have enough features I need to switch from Word. Leo Herzog The only thing left for me is custom fonts. What else are you missing? Kevfromspace A Show ruler setting would be great Marcellus1 I need a lot more formatting options. Trevor Kinsie I really hope that the redesign changes nothing about the functionality. I love Google Calendars as it is, I know it's not the purdiest thing, but that really doesn't matter to me. Please google just give it a nice coat of paint and be done, if you can add features great! Just don't take anything away. Rita El Khoury I love most of Calendar as it is, but for goodness sake, make it easier to set up notifications when someone adds an event to a shared calendar. Right now, users have to manually (and in a not-so-clear way or place) turn on email notifications for shared calendar changes, and that's it. Emails... In 2017. Miles∙Prower I know folks who love Google Calendar for what it is. Me? I'm old enough to have spent years on Palm, then on Pocket PC and Windows Mobile -- with integrations to Office desktop. When I switched over to Android and Google Apps almost a decade ago, I was surprised at the utter shittiness of the user experience in Google's productivity tools. Since then, Android's versions of these tools has improved immensely, while Google's web-based tools have remained as shitty as day 1. And Calendar is by far the worst of them. Come on, it's 2017, and you still have to navigate to a whole new web page that displays an entry form, just to see the details/notes for an appointment? Alex I'd like to see improved support for the quick entry feature on the web. In the app, it will autocomplete locations after you type "at", assigning the full address to the location field of the event. This doesn't happen on the web, at the moment. I usually end up going in to the app to manually set the location, as it works better. mondeca Congrats on finally doing things that needed doing a long time ago? James Donut Anyone uses here gmail as a journal (past dates) rather than scheduler (future)??? Daniel It's about time! The web app looks like a website from a decade ago... 4Ui812 This one's for you Rita 😁 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6e83fc9381904fe522d202244f0a29e30b87f3a4fe62d22351427aaaa3618cf6.jpg jwildman16 I've driven by there many times! Indian Hills, CO. bazsi44 A little bit of self ad maybe, but I waited too long for this, so I made a Material Redesign myself. :) You will need Stylish and Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey to use it though. http://balazsorban.com/google-calendar-web-material/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad239a2458b5009c1fa2637ba8d59dc2142593b759733b221e384075cf2fbd8e.png It may have some flows, as I updated it a long time ago. But It is still nicer than that we have now. aRvInD While design overhaul is needed, Mobile Calendar app while I daily use Only sync events/reminders only for past year! Why Google? We are using smartphone with GBs of storage these days. Giving the user with option to sync how history events need to be synced should be made..! Even now when storage is full to remaining 0%, it shows no space to save a small single SMS! Can't SMS memory reserve an MB space prior? Gonzales You'd think that Google loving the cloud there'd be plenty of room. I'm hoping this design carries over to the mobile app. I use that daily. Carson Saldanha Ink for Google's pretty good Anjo Cerdeña 👆 This, but I'm very biased. Diggle Link please? Carson Saldanha Just search for it in the Chrome Web Store Carson Saldanha It's an extension Ger PG Not really thrilled about this considering how the Contacts interface was "improved" some time ago... Winston Oh goody another way to add reminders is coming. Winston This will give me even more choices when adding a reminder, and cover so many use cases. Not confusing at all! /s EcE OMG!!!!!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19c21de580767556b5152df546358399957f9b59b55dafd30cff4d3a2553ab38.gif Nope.jpeg This might have to do for now. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clean-google-calendar/magodclodecbbnbdfpmoehfdddkhlfmm Diego S. It seems to be the end of the world!! I use Ink for Google Services Chrome Extension Butterpillar They better add flairs like in mobile apps, otherwise I won't use it. Rita El Khoury Meta: What would happen if during the revamp, calendar.google.com went down and Google forgot it had scheduled a Calendar revamp on its own calendar? wicketr What if their "revamp" is to replace it like Allo replaced Hangouts missing tons of features for an entire year.

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 5 May 2017 | MYT 7:10 AM Families of San Bernardino shooting sue Facebook, Google, Twitter by dan whitcomb LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

News Sports Life Obituaries E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Site Archive San Bernardino terrorist attack victims' families sue Twitter, Google and Facebook Thursday May 4, 2017 at 3:45 PM May 4, 2017 at 4:21 PM Families of three victims killed in the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino terrorist attack sued three media giants Wednesday, accusing Twitter, Google and Facebook of "knowingly and recklessly" providing Islamic State with a platform for years to spread propaganda, raise funds and attract new recruits. By Shea Johnson Staff Writer Families of three victims killed in the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino terrorist attack sued three media giants Wednesday, accusing Twitter, Google and Facebook of "knowingly and recklessly" providing Islamic State with a platform for years to spread propaganda, raise funds and attract new recruits. The federal lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of relatives for Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos. Each were San Bernardino County Department of Public Health employees and co-workers of shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. Filed in U.S. District Court's Central District of California, Western Division, the suit alleges that Twitter, Facebook and Google, through subsidiary YouTube, were liable for aiding and abetting acts of international terrorism and providing material support to terrorists, among other violations. The companies are accused of having "provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits," the lawsuit reads. "This material support has been instrumental to the rise of ISIS and has enabled it to carry out or cause to be carried out, numerous terrorist attacks, including" the San Bernardino attack, which killed 14 and injured 22. A Facebook spokesperson said Thursday that the company is committed to providing a service where users feel safe. "There is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it's reported to us," the spokesperson said via email. "We sympathize with the victims and their families." Twitter and Google didn't directly respond to emails requesting comment. But Twitter, which has rules prohibiting threats of violence and the promotion of terrorism, has suspended 636,248 accounts between Aug. 1, 2015 and Dec. 31 for violations relating to promoting terrorism. Between July 1 and Dec. 31 alone, Twitter suspended nearly 377,000 accounts. Yet attorneys for the plaintiffs claim in the lawsuit that ISIS accounts on Twitter had grown at an "astonishing rate" since 2010 and, until recently, its official accounts were unfettered. If it weren't for Twitter, Google and Facebook, attorneys argued, "the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible." Similar court complaints have been filed in the Pulse nightclub attack in Orlando where 49 people were killed and in the attacks in Paris that killed 130. In a June 18 report by Fortune on the Paris attacks lawsuit, interviews with legal experts by Ars Technica were cited to explain how that suit likely had little chance to succeed. The 1996 Communications Decency Act "establishes that user-generated content on digital platforms cannot be used in proceedings against the platforms," Fortune noted.

In it were several 3.5-inch floppy disks, each with the capacity of about 200KB. With that level of technology, the data needed today just for a smartphone would require a storage space as large as a fridge. Data storage efficiency has improved a zillion times. It will improve further, with researchers looking at atoms as the place to store bits and bytes. However, the demand for more storage space is increasing at an alarming rate. The volume of data that a billion people on the planet put in cloud storage is mind-boggling: pictures, songs, videos, text messages and information downloaded from the Internet. Industries send massive files across the world, multiple times to multiple recipients. In the old days, files were periodically shredded to make room for new files. With digital records and storage, people became infected with the hoarding "keep-it-they-may-be-useful" disorder. The Internet of Everything, a term used to describe the linking of devices over the Internet, will add enormous demand for more space. According to the Northeastern University in the United States, the total amount of data in the world was 4.4 zettabytes in 2013, and that is set to rise steeply to 44 zettabytes by 2020(1 zettabyte is equivalent to 1 trillion GB). A HUGE BUSINESS Big data involves "capturing, storing, analysis, data curation, searching, sharing, transferring, visualisation, querying, updating and information privacy", as Wikipedia defines it - which is as good a definition as any. According to Forbes magazine, the International Data Corporation said that worldwide revenues for big data and business analytics will grow from US$130.1 billion (S$182 billion) last year to more than $203 billion in 2020, at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7 percent. Just as Singapore is a hub of air and sea traffic, it is important to aim to to be a hub of the information highway. Singapore's renowned security regime and robust communication system make it an attractive place for hosting big data. Google's choice of Singapore for its $675 million data centre as one of only two countries in Asia to host such a centre testifies to that. However, Singapore faces challenges. It is in the tropics. The hot and humid weather means a higher operating cost for data centres. They generate a lot of heat that has to be removed by circulating cool air, gobbling up energy in the process. Countries with access to renewable energy (such as wind and hydro) or the cold air of high mountains are technically ideal places. Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon have data centres in the Nordic countries to serve Europe. China's largest data centre is 1,065m above sea level in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. Britain's foremost data centre expert Ian Bitterlin said: "The amount of energy used by data centres is doubling every four years (and) analysts forecast that data centres will consume roughly treble the amount of electricity in the next decade." According to Popular Science magazine: "The US alone annually sucks up the equivalent of the energy output of 34 coal-fired power plants. A lot of that energy goes to powering the actual servers, but almost half of it goes to keeping the servers nice and cool, so they don't overheat and crash." Data centres have immense footprints - sizes of 3ha or 4ha are common. They need to be scalable, which means they need land banks for future expansion. For a tiny island with the world's densest population, this is a challenge. This is where we need to think out of the box - and go beyond land. GOING OUT TO SEA I am an advocate of the sea as a space solution, and have written about this in previous articles. In this case, the sea is also a convenient heat sink, besides the fact that the thermophysical properties of sea water are far superior to air for the transfer of heat. Nautilus Data Technologies, set up in a naval base in San Francisco to exploit this concept, is building a floating data centre, which, it claims, will be "80 per cent more energy efficient". Microsoft is experimenting with data centres siting at the bottom of the ocean, where water temperatures are significantly lower. Google has filed a patent in the US for a "water-based data centre". The patent was "for platforms and support systems floating three miles (4.8km) to seven miles offshore in water 50m to 70m deep, using wave energy for power and sea water for server cooling, grouped into floating platforms and support systems". The Google project, although shrouded in secrecy, was voted one of the best inventions of 2008 by Time Magazine. Media reports in 2013 suggested that some floating data centres were in operation around San Francisco, although Google did not comment on the speculation. Microsoft, meanwhile, is experimenting with underwater data centres. NEW LEASE OF LIFE FOR SHIPYARDS Whether floating, semi- or fully submerged, offshore or near-shore data centres are more environmentally friendly. They consume less energy. They do not add to the heat load of the atmosphere. They do not compete for water resources as they can desalinate the water from the sea and, consequently, there is no need for miles of buried pipes to transport water to the plant to replenish evaporated water in cooling towers. Their construction generates no noise, nor does it involve earth-moving, piling or burdening roads with building material and construction equipment. Against that scenario, it should be pointed out that the oil-rig industry has suffered, and is still suffering, its worst crisis in its history, with headwinds from shale and renewables. Keppel and Sembcorp Marine have downsized their workforce and shipyard assets locally and abroad. Tens of thousands in the industry have lost their jobs. It is a dangerous situation. The industry may reach a tipping point when recovery will not be possible as has happened in the US, Britain and, more recently, in Japan and possibly South Korea. If Singapore's undergraduates lose interest in the field, the risk of an irreversible downward spiral in the industry's technological dominance cannot be discounted. In previous articles for The Straits Times, I called on shipyards to reach out to the limitless array of other floating assets, ranging from floating parks to floating nuclear power plants. Floating data centres are yet another type of asset that would fit well in the production systems of local shipyards. Floating data centres such as offshore oil rigs are exportable assets with values in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The nature of the product demands high security in the fabrication process and a strong balance sheet. It is not something for low-end shipyards with cheap labour. Singapore's larger shipyards, with their global footprint, certainly have the credibility to attract the attention of global service providers. They deserve seeding funds from the Government to test bed the concept. The Keppel Group is particularly well suited to lead the foray into this market as it is also a significant data-centre provider. The first prototype floating data centre can be a showpiece for its Keppel T&T and Keppel Offshore and Marine arms. BEYOND BARGES AND SUNKEN CAPSULES The technology and science behind floating data centres are nascent. The floating solutions employed by the pioneers in this field (Google, Microsoft and Nautilus Data) are just at the bottom rung. Builders of offshore structures, like Keppel and Sembcorp Marine, have much to contribute from their portfolio of floating solutions in shallow and deep water. They could offer solutions in international waters away from any jurisdiction and permitting environment, as well as being capable of self-sustenance in terms of water and power. These solutions have not been explored because, I suspect, the people involved lack the knowledge to stabilise and secure such structures in deep water. Semi-submersibles, with their excellent sea-keeping characteristics, could overcome that. The offshore people have also a suite of subsea asset designs, which could be explored. The power required could be conventional, nuclear or renewables, such as ocean currents, wind and Otec (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion), and could be maintenance-free as conceived in Microsoft's undersea data centre, Project Natick. To scale up, another unit could be built off-site, towed to site and fired up. If political instability undermines the security of the asset, it could be towed out of harm's way. Floating data centres for a world market could become a cornerstone of Singapore's economy. As in the case of oil rigs, they need shipyard facilities to make it happen but, unlike oil rigs, they do not need thousands upon thousands of semi-skilled workers. I suggest that the Government and Temasek Holdings, as major stakeholders of the marine industry, take the concept and turn it into another global brand for Singapore. The writer is managing director of Floating Solutions, a company using maritime engineering principles to provide floating structures for varied uses.

The plaintiffs assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the plaintiffs say. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook and Google could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. For more about Facebook and Google, watch: Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going — we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully be fixed before the KEYone is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55μm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design, the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used — I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish feels like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone — I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like — I just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see it every time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you — I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player — rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations — Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there — I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot quite hold its own next to the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing. Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades — you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84° wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up — this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone.   Nipping at the heels of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you.   DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or you can have it inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know when something accesses my calendar or to notify me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this — I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look — you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup.    The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options — I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything.   If you're super paranoid about people peering over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher — all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone — not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything with a production model when the phone is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even though it is a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting — honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it (I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do. It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me — I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...😉 Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them.

Google Wifi review: Probably the best home Wi-Fi system you can buy right now David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/12/06 5:59am PDTDec 6, 2016 67 Plus 1 on G+ 168 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares320 Google Wifi News Other Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Setup 2 Management 3 Performance 4 A great product for the average home I'm reviewing Google Wifi because my apartment sucks. Well, specifically: my apartment's walls suck. And the placement of my router is far from ideal. You see, because I need a hardline to my desktop PC in my office, that means keeping the router in the office, too, or snaking around fifty feet of unsightly ethernet from my living room along the wall (in-wall cabling is not an option for me). This presents a conundrum, because it means that if I want my apartment to have well-distributed Wi-Fi, I need a big, ugly, long cable running the length of the place. If I don't want to run the cable, it means lopsided Wi-Fi coverage. Even keeping my Shield TV's connection stable in the living room on 2.4GHz was an iffy proposition with my old ASUS NT66U router. While it performed its functions well for the past five years, signal penetration in the far corners of my new apartment simply wasn't there. In the bedroom, even surfing reddit became a frustrating fight for bandwidth at times, and no finagling of antennas seemed to help. Streams buffered, GIFs half-loaded, and sometimes I would just relent and use LTE, and my precious mobile data allocation, instead. Enter Google Wifi. You probably already know what Wifi is all about: simple, reliable, anybody-could-set-it-up mesh networking. No extra configuration required, no running cables between access points (unless you want to), and no messy multiple networks or channels. Google Wifi is designed to just work. Setup The proof of simplicity is in the setup pudding... as no one says. My experience setting up Google Wifi felt a bit slow-going at times, but was never actively frustrating (and in the end, didn't really take long at all). To start, I unplugged my old router, turned off my modem, and hooked up the first Wifi access point where my old ASUS router had sat. I flipped everything back on, waited for the modem to register, and opened up the Google Wifi app. The app asked how many access points I wanted to set up, and I selected three. Then it began to scan for the first one. For the first access point, you'll need to enter the setup network password or - more conveniently - use the QR code scanner in the Google Wifi app to automate this procedure. I used the QR code method and it went off without a hitch. A minute or two of spinning loading animations on my phone later, and the Wifi puck's light went from blue, the setup mode, to white, indicating it was now ready for use. I had set up my network name and password, and told the app the location of the first access point. Channel selection is automated and optimized based on scans conducted by the Wifi device every day, so there's no mucking about with advanced administration if you don't want to. The app prompted me to set up the next point, which I did in my kitchen, placing it underneath my Google Home. Once powered on, the app detected it, and went through the same spinning loading icon, then asked me again where the access point was. Then, it was on to the third one, which I placed in the bedroom. All said and done, it took me about 15 minutes to set up the three access points - less time than I'd spend on a typical router messing around in a web-based admin interface looking to make sure nothing silly was enabled out of the box or checking for firmware updates (Google Wifi does this automatically) that are invariably obnoxious to apply. That was it. I had a single SSID for my whole network, and devices would be intelligently sent to whichever access point provided them the strongest signal. I opened the Google Home app and reconnected my Chromecasts and Google Home (Wi-Fi password sharing is a great feature here), turned on my TV to manually connect the SHIELD, and that was it. I had a 3-point Wi-Fi mesh network. Management While not as robust as some router management interfaces, where Google Wifi (and OnHub before it) shines is in trying to make what has often been an exceptionally arcane concept - home network administration - more user-friendly. To that end, functions like device prioritization, guest network setup, administrator management, and family controls are readily exposed and designed to be simple for almost anyone to use. You still do have some more advanced features for the stuff many people consider required - DNS configuration, static IP, port forwarding, UPnP toggling, and IP reservations are in there if you need them. Beyond these and the aforementioned guest network, family tools, and device prioritization, though, there's not much else Google allows you to configure. For those who like to play pro network admin at home, Google Wifi isn't and probably will never be the kind of tool you're going to want. For those who are sick and tired of looking at a router's convoluted, jumbled mess of a web interface, though? It's almost heavenly, in a way. Previous Next Now, none of this is particularly new: OnHub did it as well. You can also look at how much data individual devices are consuming, nickname them for easier reference, and see which of your Wifi access points they're currently connected to. The app allows to remotely reboot your access points, or even factory reset them. A new feature specific to Wifi lets you control how bright the LED light on the access point is. This is handy if you put one in, say, your bedroom, where a white LED could be rather annoying. The app lets you know how strong the mesh is on each of your extended Wifi points, so you can optimize placement and proximity for the best performance. All in all, managing Google Wifi through the Wifi app (previously the OnHub app) is a straightforward and unintimidating affair. Having never used OnHub myself, this is a refreshingly streamlined network management and monitoring experience, one that would make going back to the "old" ways not unbearable, but at least annoying, at least for someone at my level of networking knowledge. Performance This is the big question for many: Does Google Wifi provide meaningfully better home network performance than a single, high-end home router? The answer, of course, is that it depends. If you currently find your existing router serves all corners of your home well, Google Wifi could actually decrease your network's performance in some conditions if you're using the 3-pack setup, which is what Google anticipates most buyers will do. I know that sounds counterintuitive, so bear with me here. Google Wifi's mission isn't to maximize your network's peak performance - it's to make the performance of that network on average more consistent and reliable. If you want the very bleeding edge of network technology and transfer speeds, there are probably better products out there for you. Similar to the management aspect of Wifi via the Wifi app, Google Wifi wants your home Wi-Fi network to be something you just have to think about less. Do I get poor signal in the bedroom? Doesn't matter anymore: just stick an access point in there. Do I need to hardwire my smart TV or game console to ensure good latency and throughput? Add an access point as part of your entertainment console. Obviously, this approach of meshing the network access across a wireless backhaul has drawbacks, namely in peak performance. My secondary mesh points on Google Wifi max out around 130-140Mbps using Speedtest.net, while the primary Wifi hub connected directly to my cable modem manages nearly 300Mbps, or more depending on the device (my connection peaks around 350Mbps on my hardwired desktop). The reason you see such a drop-off is because of the natural compromise in throughput capacity a mesh network creates. Because you're using a big chunk of the wireless radio's performance to send data between the mesh points on the network, you're losing significant total network capacity at the "meshed" points. Think of it this way: instead of merely acting as an access point, transferring data to and from end devices, Google Wifis not hardwired into your network must also do the job of then sending data back and receiving it from the hub Wifi device that's directly attached to your modem.* (*And yes, for those of you who have your homes hardwired for ethernet: Google Wifi points will default to wired network mode when you plugged directly into your network, no additional configuration required, avoiding this performance pitfall and maintaining the single SSID and intelligent access point switching of the mesh network. You do need to set them up wirelessly first to configure the mesh network. But after that, just plug in the ethernet and they'll disable the wireless backhaul mode as long as you have a supported network configuration. The short of it is that your secondary mesh points must be downstream of the primary Wifi device.) Theoretically, this could eventually be resolved by having a separate radio on each hub utilize a second wireless network completely devoted to the task of providing the wireless backhaul, but the cost and complexity compromises involved would seem to be too great to tackle just yet. But as is, the Google Wifi point farthest from the hub in my apartment still provides more than enough headroom to stream 4K Netflix... on four separate devices at the same time (in theory). I'll still leave tackling big downloads to my ethernet-wired desktop, but even a 3GB mobile game in the bedroom would still take well under five minutes. That's a far cry from the off-and-on, 2.4GHz and 5GHz switching madness I'd been enduring with my old router for the last few months, which was lucky to cap out at 30Mbps in the bedroom, even if it managed the same 300Mbps in my office that Google Wifi does now. Your next inevitable inquiry: How does it compare to other similar solutions like Eero or Luma? All I can tell you is what Google's told us. I don't have an Eero or Luma to compare to. Other similar solutions from other companies are cropping up now, as well, and I can assure you I'm just as curious to see how Google Wifi stacks up in less controlled competitive testing. But compared to my old ASUS NT66U, one of the most popular wireless routers in recent years? The fringe coverage provided by Google Wifi is immeasurably superior. Even if you can compare speeds, that's simply not what matters. By having my apartment truly blanketed in a 5GHz AC mesh network, the reliability and consistency of the network is a night and day difference. I've gone from hating our SHIELD TV, which constantly needed reboots because of Wi-Fi connectivity issues, to barely thinking about it anymore, because it just seems to work. As for my testing environment, our apartment is small, at around 1000 square feet (93 square meters). But the walls are uncompromising in their rejection of Wi-Fi signal, and due to my need for hardwire access on my desktop in the office, it means our router is placed about as far as possible from the bedroom and living room. We could probably get away with two Google Wifi points in our particular case, but three means we can have one access point for every major space in our apartment, including one in the kitchen which manages to reach well outside the door and into our building's gym room. So yeah, I'd buy three, even if it isn't strictly necessary for my case; the benefit is still there. A great product for the average home At its best, Google Wifi is an astonishingly simple way to make a home network that gives you headaches suddenly not suck. If your single Wi-Fi router is driving you and the other occupants of your domicile mad with unreliability at the edges of signal and poor throughput, Google Wifi is for you. Even if your home internet connection isn't all that fast, you can see a dramatic improvement in connection stability and reach, which can make your network feel a whole lot faster even if your ISP is only giving you 50Mbps to work with. I do have a feeling true network warriors will scoff at Wifi - it simply doesn't offer the configurability or uncompromising technical boundary-pushing that professional-grade networking hardware does. Of course, Google doesn't market it that way, and I don't think they're attempting to make an appeal to this crowd. So, there's really no point in exploring that much further. If you don't want it, you probably already knew you didn't want it. For the rest of us, by virtue of it providing a consistent and reliable experience, Google Wifi feels a bit like - and I do hesitate to say this, but I'm going to anyway - the iPhone of Wi-Fi routers. Not only does it just work, it says goodbye to the mythos that home networking has to be intimidating and that Wi-Fi is just going to kind of always suck in some parts of your home. Simple but useful tools like data usage monitoring, family controls, individual device prioritization, and guest access are just icing on the cake, if you ask me. Google Wifi shines most when you're not thinking about it, and I find myself forgetting it's part of my home more and more every day - which is the highest praise I think one can give in the very unsexy world of networking equipment. Google Wifi gets a strong recommendation from me, and further yet, I'd say skip the individual access point and just buy the 3-pack without further consideration of the "two or three" question. Three will be just as good and probably better, and the $40 you'll save picking up two is near impossible to justify. The one exception, I suppose, would be those of you with the OnHub, in which case a single Wifi might make sense, but I'll leave that call to you.

David Ruddock lol ok PerhapsNever The "typical" home user this is targeted to doesn't really need LAN ports. For those that do, a 5-8 port switch would usually suffice (and is pretty cheap to boot). Those of us that need additional LAN ports are not the target audience. David Ruddock Nah, switches don't exist. They're like bigfoot. PerhapsNever Hubs? What do the cool kids call them nowadays? lol MJ You would want a switch and NOT a hub. PerhapsNever I know. I was being facetious. LOL Carson Saldanha You could use a splitter ;) Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Switch. Carson Saldanha Haha, thanks. I always get them mixed up Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A splitter works for one-way output, such as audio or video playback. Anything that requires two-way or combining information requires something more complex. Carson Saldanha Aren't splitters only for cable television Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Splitters exist for all sorts of things. Headphone splitters, video splitters, you name it. Pretty much any sort of output can be split, so long as it also doesn't need to receive and recombine input. Carson Saldanha Man, I need to step up my networking game! 😂 UtopiaNH That would be unwise. You need something to manage the traffic (AKA a switch) whether it be a dumb switch or smart switch. Gregor Smith I said that about the OnHub and it's single LAN port, a year later and it's still not being used... James Carnley Learn about switches. Even Cisco APs only have 1 wired connection. Wireless devices are not meant to be switches. They just have them sometimes for convenience. limeypete33 If the hubs only have one ethernet port, I would still need a router/hub. My cable modem only has one ethernet out, so to plug in my desktop PC and the google wifi I would need a hub of some kind right? (or keep my old router and turn off the wifi...) David Ruddock the hubs have two ethernet ports... Ibrahim Awwal But is that one LAN and one WAN? David Ruddock One is LAN and one is WAN/LAN. demarcmj You didn't even need to read the article... just look at the pictures. mmark27 I'm assuming most people will be in the same boat. At the main hub point, where your old router used to be, you'll probably need more wired things. For example, I have a plex server, Dish Hopper, and Xbox at the point of router. So I'll just be putting that router into dumb switch mode to power those. Then let the wireless backhaul power the rest of the WiFi nodes. Seriously cleans up my setup even with having to use the router switch in the A/V closet. demarcmj You could continue to use your existing router as a router (you'd probably want to turn the wireless off on the router though)... Just plug all your existing "stuff" AND the primary Google Wifi point into the router. Carson Saldanha You could use a splitter Geoff Johnson No, you can't use a splitter for ethernet. id10terrordfw Yeah, the packets get congested trying to go upstream. Like too many Salmon in a stream. Just a big smelly mess! Not to mention the bears. newtonfb I have an Onhub, while my house isnt big enough to get another Wifi AP its a nice feature to have if i need it. Also people complaining about the lack of ethernet ports, just turn your old router into a switch. Very easy to do, takes all of 2 min. JD Wait so this supports roaming? Real roaming? Seamless roaming if you have a wired backbone would be neat at this price range. Otherwise I'm still waiting on Unifi. David Ruddock Yes, though it's not especially aggressive in deciding when to "hop" over to a new access point. You have to get to pretty degraded signal before the network will decide to bump you to a different access point. JD Is it true seamless. If I was playing a game of CS:GO and walk around my house I shouldn't experience any dropped packets. Jordan L I thought the device (not AP) is what has the final decision to hop to a new AP. right? I don't think the AP can make a device get on a different AP. (I could be wrong!) David Ruddock That's a good question, actually: I'm not sure. JD Not if it's true roaming. The AP will work with the device to say hey connect to both your packets are coming from here starting..... NOW and eventually disconnects. I can't see this working without a RADIUS server or certificate being involved. That's why I keep questioning if it's true seamless handoff. Francois Roy If you get a poor signal a poor signal in your bedroom and put an access point in there, shouldnt the access point get an equally poor signal? My logic tells me the AP should go just outside the bedroom, in order to get both a better signal AND THEN push it further. Just sayin. David Ruddock There's another AP between the main hub and the one in the furthest corner of my apartment. So no, that wouldn't make sense. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I would also assume the antenna on the APs are probably much higher powered than the ones in our devices. On top of them simply having more space for the actual antenna wire itself. Francois Roy Disposition of an optimized meshed network composed of 3 APs should either be some sort of triangle, or in the case of a straight line, at least have the device in the middle be the one connected to the Internet; If your signal has to go through B to go from A to C, you're kind of missing the point.. =P David Ruddock you could try actually reading the article to see why I did it this way though Francois Roy I did, but I guess I skipped the plan showing how your apartment is shaped more like a I than a square. Apologies dear sir. David Ruddock This is fair: I did not explain the shape of my apartment. It is indeed more of an "I" than a square. David Ruddock Here is a basic layout. Red is the hub, blue are the mesh points. (Google does not recommend having more than point in a single open area, because then they fight or something.) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0cee2bbaaf6e57df7314374fd3180950e42302111952559e7804336faeade1c8.png dogerRodger your place looks like an angry man (on left) with something exploding from his head. very nice! JD An Angry man getting forced to go down on another man. disgusting1 I can attest to that "fight" between devices. When I received my 3rd OnHub to finish my mesh, I performed the set up in the same room where I have the main OnHub router, ALL of my connections went under 1Mbps (I have 100/10Mbps, very steady 98% of the time). Until I moved the new OnHub to it's rightful place, I wasn't even able to receive whatsapp texts. Geoff Johnson The 2nd and 3rd APs only extend the quality of the signal it receives. If the AP is receiving a poor signal from the main hub, than that is the most you can obtain from any device attached to it. Ideally, each additional AP would be between the main hub and where you have performance issues, not in the same location where you have problems. David Ruddock Yeah, but the signal isn't poor. The Wifi app lets you know the strength of the mesh signal - my weakest one isn't at the maximum, but it's still well above the 50% strength rating. The point actually is to place the AP in a weak signal area (within reason), because the product's purpose is to maximize the stable coverage of the network, not to maximize peak performance at each AP. It's about providing stability and reliability at the edges of network reach. I'd happily give up 20-30% peak performance with a "non-ideal" placement if it means the weakest coverage area in my apartment now has extremely stable AC Wi-Fi. TechGuy22 can this beat my nighthawk ? David Ruddock like, in a fight? TechGuy22 hell yeah lol Dmitry Stepanushkin no, Google WiFi is for noobs. Tech guy must have much better advanced things at home, not these overpriced silly toys. David Ruddock Tech Guy, he's always got the coolest shit. Geoff Johnson No UtopiaNH Absolutely if it performs anything like the TP-Link Onhub. I owned a Nighthawk, and could barely get coverage in my bedroom. The peak speeds near it were pretty solid, though I was capped by my internet connection speed so it wasn't really all that important to me. However, I bought an Onhub because I planned to daisy chain and route it into the bedroom, but while I was testing its coverage and speeds side by side with my Nigthhawk, I noticed my connection in the bedroom was stable and speedy, and even despite plaster & metal lathe walls and brick siding, I actually got wifi signal down the street from my Onhub. Peak speeds were slightly lower next to the device, but not by much (and again, still very much capped by my internet speeds). Add in the fact I no longer needed to care about 2.4 vs 5 ghz connections and it using it all dynamically as a single SSID, better management/software, and an extremely stable connection I've literally never had to reset since I bought it over a year ago. Myy Nighthawk died 1.25 years in, shortly after I got my Onhub, but even if it hadn't died I would have replaced it. If Wifi has anything close to the experience of the TP Link Onhub, this can absolutely and completely take the Nighthawk. Ibrahim Awwal Have you tried OnHub by any chance? I've got the same Asus N66U and I'm perplexed by the now shitty wifi performance I'm getting in a measly 750 sq ft apartment, when the original apartment I was in when I bought the router was twice as big and the router seemed fine then, especially on 5ghz. Now I'm constantly fighting the wifi on my Nexus player and I don't understand; I shouldn't need mesh networking for a 1 bedroom apartment, yet that seems to be the state of affairs in 2016. Since it seems like OnHub is actually selling for the same price as Wifi these days, it seems like a safer bet since it's probably a stronger individual router and can still mesh with Google Wifi if you have others. But I'm still just perplexed that ten years ago, a single 54g router was fine for a small house, and now a MIMO N router can't cover a tiny apartment. Damn interference I suppose, but even 5ghz is crap for me lately. David Ruddock Tbh I think that OnHub works with mesh is just Google throwing a bone to current owners who got kind of shafted here (especially on the value front). I'd go with Wifi - it has better prospects for future support / features and there's no doubt Google designed it having learned from mistakes they made with OnHub. JD Google Selling beta products all the time is why I'm never buying another Google Branded product again. All those poor OnHub owners. demarcmj Why not just avoid first generation products? JD Because with Google they're all First Generation products. demarcmj oh of course... Lateef Alabi-Oki Poor OnHub owners? The OnHub is still being supported. And it's a better value than the WiFi right now. Got one for $89 on Amazon on Cyber Monday. And it works as a fantastic mesh WiFi point. It also has better range than the WiFi, and uses the same firmware. JD You heard me poor OnHub Owners. Supported? Ha more like Abandoned and firesold at $89. When the OnHub was launched there was promise of it being the central hub of Google's smart home, it has a dormant Zigbee radio. Many sites said that if Google activated the many hidden features of OnHub it would totally be worth the overpricing they did but alas Google abandoned the OnHub and launched Google Wifi and Google Home. Lateef Alabi-Oki The OnHub is not abandoned, but whatever. JD It's abandoned in the same sense the Nexus 5x and 6P are. No more fancy features are coming to these devices. It's Google's business model, everything is always beta we just release a new product with the fixes from the old but never fixing the old. Like I said every product Google makes is a first generation product. Lateef Alabi-Oki It just got mesh networking for crying out loud. It's gotten monthly security and feature updates for the past year. And Google has confirmed they'll continue to support them. But again, I see I'm wasting my time. DeePo "...which can make your network feel a whole lot faster even if your ISP is only giving you 50Mbps to work with."... Only? ONLY??? I would sell a kidney for a consistent 50Mbps connection, mine is around 5, (should be 10), which is still more than double the one I work with in my office 😤 DeePo "...which can make your network feel a whole lot faster even if your ISP is only giving you 50Mbps to work with."... Only? ONLY??? I would sell a kidney for a consistent 50Mbps connection, mine is around 5, (should be 10), which is still more than double the one I work with in my office! Dlang123 I'm just going to leave this here. I'm sure someone with fiber will come in behind me.. but just upgraded last week. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/82b58d57a4868bb45ae0b80549a622b3191b56bbb1acaee3e4f5178673bdb661.jpg David Ruddock Fucking America, the home of chronically crippled upstream. I'd halve my 350Mbps connection just to get symmetrical upstream. Dlang123 Agreed. I upgraded from 30Mb down and 5 Mb up just to get the upload halfway decent. Across the street is fiber, Gig down and Gig up.... but of course we can't get it, but the other side of the subdivision gets it. Teaches me to pick the side of the hood with the lower taxes. Geoff Johnson That's where fiber comes in vs cable/DSL, which has much more channels allocated to downstream than upstream. EowynCarter Can I play too ? http://www.speedtest.net/result/4703023237.png Upload is a shame for sure. And I though we had it bad; ProductFRED Verizon FIOS. SickoPsycho Although I'm not at home so I don't have the speedtest to back it up, AT&T came by my house a couple months ago offering me fiber. I scoffed at them and said I was waiting for Google to bring fiber (I'm in Raleigh, they are in the process of installing now). They asked why I was waiting- I said because it's supposed to be $70/month for 1Gb up/down. They offered me the same service for the same price. I couldn't refuse. And damned if it isn't full Gb up and down. I went ahead and wired my whole house because my wireless couldn't take advantage of the speed. =D Not only that, but they just killed the 1TB/month data cap- so now we have unlimited data usage per month at full Gb speeds. Works pretty well to host my Plex server, lol. rmkilc You got that right. Mine is 10/0.75Mbps. Not a typo. 0.75. TechGuy22 damn mine is not even 20 up smh vn33 Sometimes I get those numbers, but in Kb/s Nick https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/40a55d93d6b17eb1eae468d810ddfc35550f079cda14577de895b3133ad70165.png I'm the fiber guy you requested. Interested to try my Google WiFi routers. Actually had the Asus 66u as well, so I can't wait to compare. Dlang123 That's what I'm talking about. I need Fiber. humulos Damn, that Gigabit speed isn't just talk, huh. Cameron Please post your results. I have GF in Kansas City but wireless in my house is only about a 1/3 of capacity and my home office is the worst location in the house. Very curios if GWifi will make a difference. I have the google black box router currently. Nick Yeah I will do. Ill do some base tests with a few devices on my Asus router between the 4 floors of my house then again with the google router. Not sure how ill link all that data though... not sure if links to google docs are ok. :/ Tyrolis This is what I am interested in- '4 floors of my house'. I am sure they work well passing the signal to multiple floors but all the diagrams I have seen show single story layouts. Nick Ok, so after my testing here are the results. For your information my house was built in 1927 and still has all the original plaster walls / with brick, so my WiFi network is pretty slow compared to my wired network. I tested on my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floor and excluded the basement for these tests. The router is located on the 2nd floor and is pretty open on the shelf where I set it and my laptop that I used for these tests was verified on the 5Ghz network on each of these runs with all other devices disconnected. If you would like the speed test links I can supply, but its just the same data. For base comparison and a more recent speed test on my Wired desktop (Which is using a z87 Asus Sabertooth Motherboard, can check the Nic specs if you want): 956 Mbps Down / 967 Mbps Up First set was performed with a Dell XPS 15 9550 and my current Asus AC66r which has been doing its duties for about 4 years now. 1st Floor: 95.5 Mbps Down / 20 Mbps Up 2nd Floor: 100 Mbps Down / 90 Mbps Up 3rd Floor: 7.7 Mbps Down / 10.1 Mbps Up As you can see, much, much slower then my wired connection. The 3rd floor connection is pretty bad which surprises me since I would expect the broadcast to be more upwards in direction then downwards. Second test was with the same Dell XPS 15 9550 with a single Google WiFi module and in the same room. I wanted this as a raw comparison of performance before I add more complexity to the system. 2nd Floor: 467.3 Mbps Down / 476.2 Mbps Up (Getting excited a little!) Third set of tests uses the same Dell XPS 15 9550 but now with all the Google WiFi modules configured (3 connected / 1 on each floor) 1st Floor: 202 Mbps Down / 198 Mbps Up 2nd Floor: 205 Mbps Down / 200 Mbps Up 3rd Floor: 183.4 Mbps Down / 175.3 Mbps Up I was pretty surprised the see the speed decrease from the previous run, but at the same time understand that now the base hub is transmitting and doing a double load of sending and receiving data. I would like to also mention on the 3rd floor I had to move the hub closer to the center of my house (which is where the wired hub is located) to get a signal. I only had to move it maybe 5ft but still a little odd that the short distance made that much of a difference. Regardless the performance is great and the app features are just enough to mess with. While I am a little sad that I was not able to get a full 400Mbps out of all the routers, but I am very pleased with the increased performance over all, especially on the 3rd floor. Hope these tests give you some insight into this product. Cheers. disgusting1 Are you able to do a single test on the second floor, but with an OnHub router instead of a Google WiFi puck? Nick Sadly, I do not own an OnHub router. These Google WiFi modules are to replace my "old" Asus AC66R router. Nick Ok, so after my testing here are the results.

Cameron Okay when I got to the middle of your post and saw the results and then your "getting a little excited" comment it made me belly laugh out loud as I had the exact same reaction and it wasn't even my house. Thanks for taking the time to test as thoroughly as you did and share the results. Did you see an increase on 1 and 3 with only one GWifi. Just curios as the increase on floor 2 was awesome...my initial reaction was dang just get one then! But then you may not get any better coverage on 1 & 3 with just one. Right now I just have the google fiber black box and getting 85-90 down and 65-70 up. Nick I didn't do the single hub comparison on the 1st and 3rd floor unfortunately, but it would not be hard to get. If you don't mind waiting another day. Cameron Sure that would be great but only if you have time. I have the same 3 floor issue and curious about the boost from just changing from google fiber router to GWifi router without the additional units. Seem to be sold out everywhere so not in too big a rush to order today necessarily xunknownx damn how much do u pay for that? i'm paying like $80/month for comcast for 100Mb down and 10Mb up. Nick $50 a month. disgusting1 DAMN. You are in heaven. Cameron Amazon finally has the GW back in stock and I should have a set delivered on the 3rd. I am going to try and hookup one first and then test the speeds after disabling the wifi on my Google Fiber modem/router box. Cameron Got my set of three and hooked them up and tried to measure the numbers as I went adding one unit at a time....sometimes speeds seemed to be all over the place so I did averages, I still had to have other devices connected during the testing so my numbers aren't quite as pure as Nick's but you will get the flavor of the benefit. I have 3 levels basement, main and upstairs. Avg Base wifi speed all locations with existing google fiber box 24 Mbs down/34 Mbs up Adding 1 Google Wifi (GW) on the middle floor at same location as GF box 179 Mbs down/138 Mbs up Adding 2nd GW to basement level 219 Mbs down / 178 Mbs up Adding 3rd GW to upstairs level 202 Mbs down /169 Mbs up (all speeds are averages at about 20 locations in my house) So the speed increases are dramatic. Adding the 3rd unit did bring down the totals a little because of how it shares the load and that is the price of net increase of coverage especially in some previous hard to hit areas like master bedroom and garage. I still saw an overall all percentage 24%/337% increase from the 2nd to 3rd GW units so I will want the 3rd unit. So I went from a max of 50 Mbs down at the best location to 450 Mbs. Adding one was terrific if that is all you want to spend. Adding the three pack was worth it to get the most out of what I am already paying for. h4rr4r Why is your upload so terrible? demarcmj You get 5? I'd sell a kidney for 5! Half of the time my internet just doesn't work, and the other half it's like 2 or less. Sebastiaan Bakker Do I win then with my symmetrical half gigabit connection? I don't reach 500mbit because of mobile WiFi, but I do on my wired desktop. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e5de6f6e3b402cdeaa0d0ba79facd2d3df6cc98f6fc7fed82cc9227dfed06a07.png Orlando aka Pixel XL Dang man, that's fast Lars Jeppesen 1000mbit sync here, sorry dude... Nishant The place i live in india the max broadband speed i get is 2Mbps.... that above speed is a dream!!! :( ReallyMen You haven't head about ACT then. Mine is 1049₹ plan with 50 Mbps download speeds. Nishant I definitely heard about ACT , But its not available in Goa yet :( I pay ₹1932 for 2Mbps Unlimited!!! abc A rural area will never get the broadband speed a large city does.

My mind boggles at reaching those kind of numbers on a wifi network. A few months ago my house upgraded to 75/15, and I thought THAT was fast. Nick https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/40a55d93d6b17eb1eae468d810ddfc35550f079cda14577de895b3133ad70165.png Anyone else get more upload then download? Roy Same! I pay for 5, but only get around 3. There is a fiber option where I live but since Verizon sold off to Frontier, the internet connection disappears for hours at a time and the speed for some reason became ridiculously unstable... UGH. As much as I hate Bright House, at least their connection is stable if not as fast as advertised. Although they also got bought out, it hasn't impacted performance the way Frontier did, fortunately. Go America! Cenarl Don't sell your kidney for so low, 50Mbps will be obsolete soon enough. h4rr4r You need FIOS. 50 is slow. Dmitry Stepanushkin I have a question. Is it compatible with PornHub? /s Not for you How do the three seashells work? David Ruddock you hold them up to your ear and whisper google searches then you hear the sound of the ocean, because they're not connected to electricity Arsene’s zip By the seashore. Not for you I am disappointed that a gooner is not familiar with the 90's Schwarzenegger classic "Demolition Man". Matt I'm disappointed that you think Schwarzenegger was in it. He was only mentioned in it as having been the president. Shane C. Boom! Not for you Gold star for you! demarcmj You mean that 115 min Taco Bell commercial starring Sandy B and Sly Stallone? techinv I have multiple hard wired points in my home that I'd like to continue to use. Can I use 3 of the Google devices simply as access points with one plugged into my wired router? David Ruddock Yes, and this help article explains supported configurations (of which the one you suggest is). https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/7215624 BBpost I'm guessing this doesn't have more than one channel for each frequency? Therefore slow and fast devices will be on the same channel, thus making them all slow? DrPyro David Ruddock, Any Idea? My understanding is that wifi really only works as fast as the "slowest" device, which is my concern as I have several "old/slow" b/g devices. So I have my router setup for a 2.4GHz network for the "old" devices and a 5 GHz network for my newer devices. This way my devices are fast and not slowed down by the other family devices. However, I don't have great coverage with the single router at the edges of the house, and a mesh device (with wired backhaul) would be helpful. PacoBell The 802.11s spec never really had any concept of multi-radio/multi-channel operation, so it's unlikely that Google implemented such a thing in their product. There's another product called Plume, however, that does and I'm really curious how it stacks up to Google's attempt at mesh. vn33 David, just curious why you didn't try the Eero system since they came out first? I have a set and they have been great at pushing out updates to improve the performance. demarcmj I think being made by Google, this particular system is more relevant to a site called "Android Police" vn33 LOL! demarcmj Why was this funny? Ha vn33 Just having a chuckle at how you're making the relevance/connection of Android Police = Android = Google = router, while I was just curious if David had thought about using the Eero to address his WiFi difficulties. Not asking if he would review the Eero system. Anyway, not trying to offend you .. just find your connection amusing. demarcmj Yea I guess I misread/misinterpreted your initial question. I thought you were asking why they didn't review it. Now I get that you were referring to David's specific apartment headaches and wondering why he didn't jump at Eero when they arrived on the scene. Dubs816 Because he's a Google fanboy? Davor G. If I buy the three pack is it possible to use them 1 in one home, and 2 in another (or are they somehow linked)? David Ruddock Yes. There is nothing special tying them together. All three devices in the pack are identical - there is no special "hub" device. Any device in the pack can be a hub or a mesh AP. JD Google should have added integrated EoP networking it would help get around the Repeater bridge bandwidth penalty. PerhapsNever Except that EoP is only good with newer wiring over short distances (I believe the recommended range is still around 500 feet, give or take?). Many places have crappy wiring (like my old house) and EoP (which I tried briefly to get around the cinder block/concrete wall issues) was absolutely horrendous. Plus, if you have a place that has a lot of GFCI/AFCI outlets, you are going to get noise on the network that will hamper performance. Add onto that power strips that bleed noise onto the lines and you get the picture. If Google had added EoP, it would have been a support nightmare. JD Have you used the new "Gigabit" rated EoP hardware? I know it'll never hit Gigabit speeds, but it's just the newer generation. They are significantly better than Mesh networking and significantly better than the old EoP hardware that's rated for 200/500megabits. It's on par with a wired 100Megabit network once all the overheads are accounted for. Which is faster than the 120-150Megabit "connected" speeds of wifi. PerhapsNever Yeah, I tried the Netgear Powerline 1200 and also one of the ActionTec models. The fastest I got was ~45 mb internally. Granted, the wiring in my old house was done in the 1960s, so really old and I also run a TON of equipment (entertainment centers in 3 rooms, about 10 power strips of varying ages, plus home automation stuff), so I know my lines are not free of noise at all. I haven't tested any of them in my new house (which was built in 2010) though. JD I've used them in houses that were built in the early 60s and in homes in the last 10 years. You do have to make sure some of the circuits are clear and if you can try to have them on the same phase. I get about 80% of the theoretical speeds in perfect setups, and faster than 100Megabits in non-ideal setups. They don't like power strips, they don't like circuits that have large motors on it, but they work better than strict wireless repeaters PerhapsNever Good to know! Thanks. disgusting1 You seem to be missing the point of Mesh here. Mesh is meant to give you 1 SSID for all of your WiFi, in order to make the handoff from 1 point to another seamless. You can do the same exact thing, only better with mesh, just by wiring the wifi points instead of meshing through wifi. That's what I did with my OnHub mesh (well, 1 point anyway, the furthest one from the main router), and it beats the new EoP Gigabit hands down. "On par with 100 Megabit", what a joke. JD You seem to be missing the point. But that's ok. You think you know what you're talking about but you don't. Ignorance is bliss as they say. disgusting1 Ooook. Total Insecurity Do you need one modem per Google WiFi? Or do you just need one modem for all of them together? PerhapsNever Just one for all of them. Total Insecurity Wow, that is nice! PerhapsNever The beauty of mesh networking. LOL YEah, once you connect your modem to your "main" hub, you then attach the other ones to power and then hook them up through the WiFi app. Total Insecurity Great, thanks for the reply! :) Total Insecurity So if I understood it correctly you just connect the others to the electricity port socket? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Nobody has multiple modems. Your ISP wouldn't support them unless you were paying for a connection for each of them. Tyler Lamb So can you use one of the LAN ports to hook up a non-wifi device to the network? (Not to the device that is plugged directly into your modem) PerhapsNever Yes. WifI has a WAN/LAN port (for your modem connection) and a LAN port (for local network access). David Ruddock And the WAN/LAN port can serve as either, in case that isn't clear in this reply. Tyler Lamb Nice. Makes this a little more interesting got a few devices with no wifi so would be useful to get them hooked up. sebastianer Can you enable "Wake On LAN" with this router? I like to wake up my Desktop (which is usually sleeping) in order to connect to it using Chrome Remote Desktop or Windows RDC. PerhapsNever There's no setting for WOL in the WiFi app, so beyond doing it locally on your network, I don't think it'll support it externally. sebastianer That's so sad I was really interested in this router. I have 300/30Mbps internet and the TP-Link Archer C2 I have doesn't work well at 5Ghz (after a few days of rebooting the device) so I was considering Google WiFi as an alternative. Do you know if OnHub supports WoLAN? PerhapsNever Do you do WoL outside of your home network? sebastianer Yes, when I'm outside home. I have a port mapped to the MAC address of my PC in the router. My Desktop enters sleep mode (consuming 3.5W instead of 45W when awake/idle) after a few minutes. That's why I find WoLAN very interesting. PerhapsNever Totally agree. You MIGHT be able to do it with port forwarding (which is supported for both TCP and UDP), but I haven't tried it. Typically, if I need anything from my home PC, I just sync it to Drive and grab it from there. Plus, I'm notorious for always having my laptop with me anywhere I go. LOL Tom Hallman I do the same thing, sebastianer. One option I'm considering to improve overall wifi range is turning my existing wireless router (which supports WOL) into a switch, and then connecting the Google Wifi behind that. That way the wireless clients get better internet coverage, but I can still WOL & RDP in from outside. Haven't actually done this yet, but I can't see why it wouldn't work... Matt How is this any different than adding traditional wireless access points? Google says "While one solution to increase range is an extender, they can decrease bandwidth and have limited reach as well." But then your description of how this works sounds identical. jm9843 Single SSID with seamless handoff. Matt You can set up a wireless access point to have the same SSID, and if this does do seamless handoff, that's nice, but that isn't relevant to the bandwith issue that WAPs suffer from that Google WiFi seems to suffer from as well, even though they advertise it like it doesn't. JD Is It truely seamless handoff. I can't get a straight answer out of any of the sites that reviewed it. Seamless means no dropped packets and no interruption of any kind. humulos *Looks at current wifi router* *sees four ethernet cables coming out, in use* Darn... guess it's not for me... demarcmj You could still keep the old router for the ports. humulos Does the Google Wifi piggyback off of non-Google Routers? demarcmj The Router would be upstream of the Google Wifi. You would just turn off wireless on your router and take one of the "four Ethernet cables coming out" of your router and plug it into the primary Google Wifi hub. EDIT: Whatever device that wire was previously serving could be connected via the second port on the Google Wifi hub. humulos Good point! Thanks for the tip hunter2 If this google wifi has features you need, you could easily work around your issue with a switch. humulos Need is a very strong word. Honestly I have no issue with my setup right now, I just have a terrible issue where I want the latest hotness. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman You get a cheap gigabit switch. Same solution as the OnHub. aschesiegen Or you could use powerline adapters... PerhapsNever Powerline adapters are not nearly as resilient as mesh networking is. Plus, you run the risk of noise on the lines and old, crappy wires can tank your network speeds with EoP. JD The newer EoP hardware is significantly more resilient and faster than Mesh networking,. aschesiegen Have been using powerline adapters in a home built in the 60s for the past 6 years. They have given me almost the same speed as a direct LAN consistently. PerhapsNever I didn't have nearly that nice of an experience and my wiring was about the same age. JD What was the vintage of Powerline adaptors you used? The earlier generation of hardware was garbage. But that's like everything. Just like 802.11B terrible compared to wifi these days. PerhapsNever LOL True. I was using Netgear Powerline 1200 adapters. aschesiegen The one I'm using currently is the Cisco PLWK400 with the built in WiFi YaKillaCJ This setup would be horrendous on my current in use devices. I have minimum 12 devices using WiFi on at all times. This doesn't even include phones, tablets, laptops, game systems that can be turned off or taken outside. Question, your apartment doesn't have any carpet, base boards, crown molding? I understand it being an apartment means ya don't want to do any big modifications or upgrades tho. hunter2 Can it update a DDNS service? I can probably make due without 90% of the features my router has, but letting me update my ddns server is one that I really need because it would kill off so many other things if I couldn't get into my home network via duckdns. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I was wondering the same, especially since my registar and name services are all done through Google now anyway. I would hope they'd support their own. PerhapsNever They do support custom DNS servers (which is what I am assuming you mean as opposed to dynamic DNS?) through the WiFi app. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman No, completely unrelated. PerhapsNever Nope. zlink44 For those of you who are more technically inclined (even more technically inclined than the baseline of "reads an Android fan site"), I cannot recommend Ubiquiti's Unifi AP-AC-PROs highly enough. They're also $129 (though often on sale for less), and the range and stability is bananas. They're designed for commercial-level reliability and features, but priced like consumer routers. We have two of them covering our 4 floor, 2500 square foot home, and the connection is rock solid everywhere in the house. At work, 5 of them cover 20,000 square feet. Particularly important to me is a feature called band-steering, something generally only available on high end commercial routers, which pushes devices to the substantially faster 5 Ghz band even though most devices will try to default to 2.4 Ghz if you have a single SSID for both. Google OnHub and WiFi can do this, in theory, but my understanding is that in practice they don't (Perhaps David can confirm). That said, I'm really not kidding that you need to be technically inclined. They are just access points, so you need a separate router to do the actual routing (your old router will work fine for that, just disable the wifi part of it). Additionally, you need to have controller software running on your PC to do management (unless you get REALLY fancy and host it on an Amazon S3 instance or something). JD Yes Love Ubiquiti's stuff. Typically love pairing it with pfSense boxes or Sophos UTM. Just waiting for Unifi to hit that sweeter price point in Canada. zlink44 Is it that much more expensive in Canada? Is there money to be made smuggling Unifis across the border? dangle_me Try the AmpliFi line also a Ubq product. JD That's what I'm waiting for, waiting for it to hit Canadian markets. Sootie The ruckus stuff is pretty rad too and you can apparently do controller less now too but again enterprise grade and probably way overkill at home (also $$$) thespacecowboy Once they switch on the Family Wifi pause, two of my kids are going to kick up merry hell :) dangle_me Kinda biased aren't you? The AmpliFi LR or HD worked better for me. Google's app didn't have some of the features of the AmpliFi. And performance wise, Google was not as good Christopher Bement Maybe if the article was a comparison, then yeah. But this is just a review, and he didn't even mention Amplifi. dangle_me Oh I understand that, but it implies it the best on the market. Arthur Dent "Your next inevitable inquiry: How does it compare to other similar solutions like Eero or Luma? All I can tell you is what Google's told us. I don't have an Eero or Luma to compare to. Other similar solutions from other companies are cropping up now, as well, and I can assure you I'm just as curious to see how Google Wifi stacks up in less controlled competitive testing." Um, it pretty clearly does not imply that. You seem unhappy that he liked the product for some reason. disgusting1 How much is Ubiquity paying you? robertlwalters Anyone know how I can use this with Verizon Fios and its Quantum Gateway (G1100)? j6nguyen Just plug it into your Wireless Router from Verizon. I would disable the wireless signal on your router, and just use Google's. robertlwalters Will this screw up my set top boxes for its menu and on demand? j6nguyen Nope! exquisitemb My 3 pack is arriving today. I cant wait. Jefferson Ietto Novo but does it support VLAN tagging? My fiber ISP requires this feature. multiplechaos That's nice and all, but I'm quite happy with the two UniFi AC-AP Lite's in my house. These are not connected in a mesh, therefore if one fails I still have the other. Lateef Alabi-Oki I saw a dramatic improvement in WiFi performance when I hooked up my OnHubs as a mesh. I was pretty surprised and very impressed. I'm still going to buy the 3 pack WiFi. I've noticed that with WiFi, redundancy matters. Vivek Rameses I'll stick with my linksys, I wouldn't trust this at all. Arthur Dent Why? Corey Munns I wish they would have gone the Apple AirPort route and thrown a Chromecast Audio inside it. David Hyman I was really hoping it would rely on IPoE for connecting the hubs together. Considering it has a type c port and that tech is quite mature now it would eliminate the bandwidth limitations of a pure wireless setup James Sarino I'm curious, would you have better performance if you had a OnHub and Wifi combination, than a straight Wifi mesh setup? keithzg Almost certainly, since the OnHub units (both the TP-Link one and the slightly superior ASUS one) have higher wireless throughput. That's probably what I'd set up at my parents' house if Google would deign to sell these units to Canadians. James Sarino Thanks! I feel I don't need a set of Wifi devices, but want to setup a mesh of two. So, having the OnHub and Wifi sounds like a better option then. disgusting1 If you already have an OnHub, get a second one, and mesh that. It will give you moree coverage and better speed than Google WiFi. James Sarino Hmmm, hadn't thought of that! disgusting1 Buy them from Amazon. MReprogle No DDNS Hostname support makes this a no go for me. Not sure how Asus can implement this, then have it stripped out when they built OnHub, and even with quite a few people asking for this support, Google just continues to say that they are looking into it.. Sure, they are.. tintin.92 I'm still using the modem/router that Comcast gave me, and I don't really have any complaints at all in my tiny apartment, other than the $1- per month rental. Should I wonder Google WiFi, despite the fact that I'd have to buy a modem as well? Iamsecond I have 50Mb... plus free healthcare and a much better range of baked goods, cakes, bread, cheeses, pâtés... really most good food... than most Americans. Oh, and chocolate that doesn't taste like a hobo's vomit... Oh, and mobile contracts that don't suck... Oh, and free digital TV in HD* that doesn't suck, and free digital radio that doesn't suck... Oh, and few natural disasters, no major predators, and no rabies... Oh, and no Donald Trump... Do I win? :) (Let me have it Scandinavians!) *Disregarding the TV licence, which is worth every penny for the benefits we get. Gonza The big question for me here is , if it can support just a layer 2 WLAN mesh network, to use with an external router where I can configure anything I like. Sadly, I guess the answer is no.. but I still would like to confirm, that is if anyone knows. Sk0ly My girl is pushing me to buy this purely because of aesthetics lol but I can't really justify it when I have an Asus RT AC68U in my tiny apartment regardless of how ugly it is. It's an amazing router! oGre X Ok, So I have 250/100 Mbit connection with a wired router doing the firewall/NAT stuff. Then I use an ASUS RT-AC66U and an ASUS RT-AC87U in AP mode for wireless access. Both APs are wired on a Gbit backbone. Can Google wifi replace that setup, i.e. act as AP only or do I need to use one as firewall/DHCP server for my LAN? My current setup can max out my Internet connection on all wireless devices, but I have spots in the house where the devices might loose connecton before reconnecting to the other AP. Google wifi sounds nice, but only if they can work as APs with a better coverage than my current setup and not loosing speed. dabug91 Excellent review David. Though it would seem that for the price, many people would be better off buying a high-end $300 router from Asus or Netgear rather than a $300 mesh network from Google. Routers are more than simple enough to setup. Anyone with a 3rd-grade reading comprehension level can go out and buy a high-end router and simply follow the included instructions to have it up and running in a matter of minutes. Adam Margeson As someone that can do all that, I beg to differ. The moment computers and numbers come into play, normal people's brains shut down, even the semi-intelligent ones. I work in the low-voltage electronics industry and only support "professionals", yet when they call and I ask them to measure the incoming AC terminals, I have seriously been asked, "Do I set my meter for AC or DC?" Don't even get me started on getting these guys to setup a computer. ibsgaard Looking forward to receive mine, I have pre ordered from B&H, could not wait for Google to announce it in Denmark on_the_fence i think i need to look at the Ubiquiti's AmpliFi as mentioned in these comments. The wifi looks like it may have issues with more complex environments needing a mesh and bridge mode. https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/onhub/idqXWjr69Ek;context-place=forum/onhub Sava D. omg dat speed.. you people are spoiled.. :) Justin Cornelius On an other review it says you can't reach your hard wired devices if you place the Google Wifi after a router where those hardwired devices are on. Is that correct? disgusting1 That is correct, because those would be under a different LAN (network). Justin Cornelius Thanks for confirming... Than it's a useless product for me. Guess have to wait what Asus and sitecom has in store before I decide. Midnight Blue I currently have an 8 port switch attached to my FiOS router and all of my hardwired devices (including a downstream 5 port hub) are connected to that. My plan is to connect the 8 port switch to the Google Wifi LAN port so that all hardwired devices are downstream from that. Wouldn't that work? FiOS router would have just one connection between it and the first Google Wifi unit (WAN port). Will the FiOS app on my phone see the DVRs assuming the phone connects to the new Google Wifi WLAN? disgusting1 If you have 2 or more OnHubs, your Mesh will be way more solid than with Google WiFi. Granted, it will also be infinitely more expensive, but if you have the money to spend, definitively go that extra mile, and enjoy a full WiFi blanket with NO dead spots, in my experience, over 2 floors of 3,000 sq.ft. each, with solid concrete walls in between. use_the_force Sounds like the downstream repeaters are operating in half-duplex mode, since they have half the available bandwidth of the main router. daraghfi I pre-ordered so have been using this for months. 1. Google WiFi support SUCKS, although the app keeps dangling that option. Email is okay, but if you call, expect long wait times (I'm at a 50 minutes-and-counting hold, without talking to anyone, right now). Oh, and the app even offers a call-back service, and it does call you right back - so that you can join the wait queue - NOT called back when a technician is actually available. So that's useless and deceiving. 2. It is not a 'mesh', it is a hub. Evident when placing a third wifi point, it wants to connect to the primary, which is further away than the second wifi point, and even complains of such. Another deception. Otherwise, the app is o-kay - needs a lot of work (ironically if it was better then there would be less dependent on support), and the infrastructure is generally very reliable. It still needs technical knowledge at times, but is what I would recommend for the technically challenged - but expect them to call you instead of Google. Overall, this is a big ding on the Google brand for me. I have a Pixel XL & Chromecast, use all the services at home, school and at work, and this is a low-point.

News Nation & World Science Technology approaches real human voices; could 'new reality' of fake audio be on horizon?

Asher Labovich, 13, and his 10-year-old brother, Emerson, left, mess around with the family's Alexa, an Amazon Echo voice assistant, while their mom, Laura Labovich, watches in Bethesda, Md. (Bill O'Leary / The Washington Post) Avi SelkWashington Post What if you could make President Trump say whatever you wanted? How about listening to the vaguely robot-like voice of yourself, programmed into an app based on a sample of your speech? The technology will be ready "soon," according to a team of researchers from the University of Montreal's institute for computer-based learning algorithms. Now they're seeking investors for their product, Lyrebird, and hope to join Google in the fast-expanding business of mimicking human voices. Virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri have driven the voice technology into the mainstream, where we can control our phones, cars and even refrigerators through verbal commands. And now we face a future where the perfect vocal replication of the president of the United States -- or you, or anyone -- could be just a few years away, some experts say. How does that future sound? Whoever wins the development race, experts in technology and ethical fields are gearing up for products that will do to voice what Photoshop did to photos -- make reality very difficult to tell from a simulation. Lyrebird is aware of the downsides. The technology is exciting -- with potentially "dangerous consequences such as misleading diplomats, fraud and . . . stealing the identity of someone else," according to an ethical disclaimer on Lyrebird's website. The developers did not immediately respond to an interview request. Nevertheless,the inventors plan to begin selling what they call the first technology "to allow copying voices in a matter of minutes" -- with fine tuning for emotional control. Scientific American notes that Lyrebird and a competing Alphabet-owned project called WaveNet use neural network technology -- code patterned after neurons in the human brain -- to simulate human speech on the fly. In contrast, existing voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa "work by cobbling together words and phrases from prerecorded files of one particular voice." Lyrebird says its technology, once released, will be able to mimic any voice based on as little as a minute of audio recording -- though one of the developers told TechCrunch that longer samples would reduce the "distinctly metallic rasp" that the outlet noted in clips released so far. While Lyrebirds developers have not announced a release date for their product, they claim it will simulate audio much faster than Google's WaveNet. When the tech giant's artificial intelligence unit demonstrated WaveNet last year, listeners rated it as the closest simulation yet of human speech, according to the Verge. However, the outlet noted, Google's team had to manually tweak the audio output or it sounded like AI baby babble. Timo Baumann, a speech processing researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, told Scientific American that Lyrebird's audio sounded a tad robotic but that convincing human simulations -- voice assistants that people might treat like friends -- were a few years away. Five major tech giants: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.com are pursing what The Washington Post's Elizabeth Dwoskin called "an arms race" to create the next generation of virtual assistants to make our personal devices converse like humans, if not also sound like them. "It's about taking the way that humans have naturally interacted with each other for thousands of years and applying that to the way they interact with services," Dag Kittlaus, a co-f0under of the Siri app now in every iPhone, told Dwoskin. He was working on a conversational artificial intelligence technology he hoped would replace it. The prospect of computer-simulated voice concerned a security technologist from Harvard University, who told Scientific American that a "new reality" of fake audio clips was on the horizon. "A refined version of this system could replicate a person's voice with incredible accuracy, making it virtually impossible for a human listener to discern the original from the emulation," Gizmodo warned. "The day is coming when vocal speech, like an image processed in Photoshop, can be manipulated without our knowing." When Adobe demonstrated yet another form of voice-faking software last year -- one that rearranges words in pre-recorded audio clips -- a technology researcher at the University of Stirling expressed horror to the BBC. "It seems that Adobe's programmers were swept along with the excitement of creating something as innovative as a voice manipulator," Eddy Borges Rey told the outlet, "and ignored the ethical dilemmas brought up by its potential misuse." The creators of Lyrebird said they want their technology to be used for good: "Giving back the voice to people who lost it to sickness, being able to record yourself at different stages in your life and hearing your voice later on," one of Lyrbird's developers told Gizmodo. The team told TechCruch it plans to make its voice simulator available to anyone with an Internet connection -- with free samples for fake audio in a voice of one's choosing, and a fee-per-sentence thereafter. "We hope that everyone will soon be aware that such technology exists and that copying the voice of someone else is possible," the developers wrote.

In 2017, that means it’s on May 14. Most moms (even geeky ones) A Day In The Life: Two Tech-Savvy Moms & Geeks A Day In The Life: Two Tech-Savvy Moms & Geeks With the introduction of ever more sophisticated smartphones and tablets into the market, and the availability of some of the most amazing apps out there, it should come as no surprise just how dramatically technology... Read More generally don’t ask for much from their children, but celebrating Mother’s Day in some way is always appreciated. Depending on when you’re reading this you’ve probably still got time to pick a card, buy a gift, and arrange a nice meal out. If that’s your thing. However, just in case you’ve left it too late, or are too tight to treat your mom well, Google has your back with a new feature on Google Photos. A Mother’s Day Movie Starring Your Mom This tool lets you make a Mother’s Day movie using photos you’ve stored on Google Photos. All you need to do is visit photos.google.com/mothersday, select which person is your mom, add some kids (you, your siblings, or even people you barely know), and Google Photos does the rest. After a few minutes of processing, your Mother’s Day movie will appear in your Assistant tab. And, thanks to facial recognition, Google Photos should have chosen photos featuring your mom with whoever you indicated were her children. Even if that’s the weird guy who lives down the street. There are some limitations to this feature. Firstly, you’ll actually need a decent number of photos of your mom stored on Google Photos for it to work. You could upload some fresh images just for the occasion, but that may be too much effort for what is essentially a last-minute gift idea. Also, unlike with Facebook’s friendship anniversary videos, you can’t manually choose the photos used in the movie, or edit the video after it’s been made. Still, beggars (or, more accurately, forgetful sons and daughters too busy to actually care about their parents) can’t be choosers. Taking the Credit for Google’s Hard Work As we said earlier, moms don’t tend to ask much from their kids. So the least you can do is make a Mother’s Day movie showcasing photos featuring the two of you together. After all, Google Photos is doing all of the hard work How to Make Google Photos Work for You with These Tips How to Make Google Photos Work for You with These Tips Google Photos could be the much-awaited solution to manage all your photos. But is it the best among all online photo sharing sites? Read More , leaving you to take the credit for being a loving son or daughter. Do you use Google Photos as your default camera app? If so, what’s your favorite feature? And what would you change about the app? Are you going to use Google Photos to make your mom a Mother’s Day movie?

In the Trading With Cody Chat Room today, people are upset about our losses in Gigamon and the fact that I'm cutting those losses this week. "Hi Cody as you have probably read myself and few others have been discussing exit strategies on some stocks. I have one I use but am curious on what you think. I'm not talking about stocks like Apple and Google and Amazon and Facebbook but stocks like GIMO, FIT, and even FSLR, AMBA. Why let these run down 50% or more without some kind of risk control which, for me, is needed in investing or trading?" And "I was right there with you on $FIT, and took my lumps too, so I feel you pain on both stocks (although I have not sold $GIMO yet). Both of those names are good reasons for the discussion that we have been having on the board about trying to be strategic in having an exit plan as well. I think one thing we really cannot afford to do in our portfolios have big losers. It would be really good if we could get some feedback from Cody on how to handle these stocks that lose a lot of value, fast." Look, if there were some sort of a magical system that could prevent me from ever buying any stocks that I end having to sell for a loss, I would do it. Don't you think Bill Ackman would have spent a billion dollars to find that magical system that would have kept him from losing 90% of his investment, a loss of $4 billion, in his fund's largest position, Valeant, from 2015 to 2017? One of the systems we can use, and which I have indeed used on Fitbit last year and Gimo this week -- cutting our losses and moving on. You might think you can simply employ some sort of "I'll always sell if the stock is down 20%" or something. But then you'd have sold Apple and Google and Amazon and Facebook many times over the years while I've held onto them and trusted in my analysis. You'll simply never be able to find a system that would enable you to sell out of a stock before it drops 30% or 50% or more and then be able to get back into it before it goes back up 3-fold or 5-fold or 100-fold like Apple has since we bought back in March 2003. I always hearken back to the memories of $AAPL, $GOOG, $FB and $AMZN having been down 50% or more at many points during the many years that I've been owning those names. If you try to out-trade the long-term value creation of investing in Revolutionary Companies you'll end up missing most of the 1000%, 10,000% returns over the years. My analysis is my best risk control, by which I mean that analyzing stocks and trends and getting positioned for the big cycles in the market properly is the best way for me to control risk. Not trying to control risk through trading in and out of individual stocks -- which is simply impossible to do consistently over many years and decades. So yea, it's easy to be like: FB and Apple and Amazon and Google are mega-cap stocks and they're different than non-mega cap stocks. But I'm here to remind you that I was buying -- investing (not trading) each and every one of those four stocks long before they were mega-caps. Facebook's market cap when I bought it: $50BB. Market cap now: $440BB Apple Market cap when I bought it: $4BB. Market cap now: $770BB Google - Market cap when I bought it: $30BB. Market cap now: $670BB Amazon - Market cap when I bought it (though I have bought and sold this stock entirely several times over the years since I first bought it -- regrettably, because I'd have made much more money if I'd just held it): $70BB Market cap now: $450BB Want some more context? Here are the market caps of some of our stocks not named Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook right now: Nvidia's market cap when I bought it a couple years ago: $18 billion. Market cap now: $60 billion. Axogen's market cap when I bought it about three years ago: $120 million. Market cap now: $400 million First Solar's market cap when I bought a few years ago: $3 billion Market cap right now: $3.6 billion Ambarella's market cap when I bought it a few years ago: $800 million. Market cap now: $1.9 billion Sony's market cap when I bought it a few years ago: $15 billion. Market cap now: $42 billion Palo Alto's market cap when I bought a few months ago: $13 billion. Market cap right now: $11 billion Snap Chat's market cap when I bought a few weeks ago: $23 billion. Market cap now: $25 billion. And as for the losers mentioned above: Fitbit's market cap when I bought it: $5 billion. Market cap when I sold it: $2 billion. Gigamon's market cap when I bought it: $1.6 billion. Market cap now as I'm selling it: $1.2 billion Certainly I've had other stocks I'd sold for a loss over the years, but that's part of cutting your losses. But you can see that our many winners that we've let ride over time, even as they've had pullbacks of 30% or 50% or more over that time frame, because we trusted our analysis and didn't try to create a system where one doesn't exist. I mean, let's keep it real here -- how many other writers, investors or money managers can point to the fact that they bought each of the four largest and most valuable stocks on the planet long before they were the four largest and most valuable stocks on the planet. I do want to be clear though -- I hate losses just as much as you guys do and I'm trying every day to do everything I can to avoid them! This article was written by Cody Willard for on .

"The site you are trying to visit has been identified as a forgery, intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal or other sensitive information," the text of the warning says, with options to continue at your own risk or report an incorrect warning. The feature will be gradually rolled out to all Gmail users over the next days and comes shortly after an elaborate phishing attack involving an app that posed as Google Docs, and tricked a large number of users into granting the malicious app access to their Google accounts. The company resolved the problem within about an hour of it being reported by revoking the app and disabling the offending accounts. The new feature appears to use Google's Safe Browsing database, which catalogs sites known to host malware or trick users into giving away information. Ironically, since the fake Google Docs app actually resided on Google's web domain, this wouldn't have stopped yesterday’s phishing outbreak. Still, it’s a step in the right direction to protect unsuspecting users from giving out sensitive information. "While not all affected email will necessarily be dangerous, we encourage you to be extra careful about clicking on links in messages that you're not sure about. And with this update, you'll have another tool to make these kinds of decisions," Google wrote in its post announcing the feature.

Source: GrabPress The Google Doc phishing scam worked by asking users to approve access to Google Docs. It did this by sending an email through one of their known contacts. This email looked the same as the official email for sharing documents between the service. The Google Docs that wants access isn’t actually the service ran by Alphabet Inc. Instead, it seeks permission to take control of the person’s account. After this it can send emails to their contacts to help it spread. It didn’t take long for Google to catch wind of the Google Docs phishing scam and bring an end to it. Roughly one hour after the company learned of the problem, it was resolved. Users that have given access to the fake Docs program may check their third party apps to see if it still has access to their accounts. If so, they will want to remove that permission. However, Google says users shouldn’t need to do this. “We have taken action to protect users against an email spam campaign impersonating Google Docs, which affected fewer than 0.1 percent of Gmail users,” Google said in a statement. “We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions, including removing the fake pages and applications, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, and other anti-abuse systems.” Scammers are becoming more clever lately and making emails look official is a problem. A Gmail phishing scam earlier this year used similar tactics to try and fool users into giving up their information.

The new protections come one day after a Google Docs scam made its way around the internet. The phishing attack sent users an email link to a fake Google Doc, which redirected them out of Google and forwarded the link to all of the user’s contacts. © Photo: Pixabay Google Customers Targeted by Malicious Phishing Emails While the scam was shut down by Google within an hour, it still managed to reach a large number of users. The new anti-phishing measures include a warning from Google when a user receives a phishing link, saying, "the site you are trying to visit has been identified as a forgery intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal or other sensitive information." Phishing is the use of malicious emails appearing to come from reputable companies, such as Google, seeking your personal information such as passwords, addresses or credit card information. "While not all affected email will necessarily be dangerous, we encourage you to be extra careful about clicking on links in messages that you’re not sure about.

However, the road to success can be thorny, as local SEO is becoming more and more competitive nowadays and presupposes lots of little things to improve and to keep in mind. To nail it, a business has to offer something universal and yet unique enough to be discovered by consumers in a local neighborhood. So, apart from all the conventional SEO enhancements, it’s a whole new layer of elaborate adjustments to apply, which may take a bit of thinking outside the box. In this post let’s sum up all the crucial things to look after and some useful tips on how to optimize your business not just for a state or a city, but in a really local way. Your Website It all starts with a website, and your key priority in building it should be user-experience. You’ll probably put a lot of effort into bringing traffic to your site; respectively, you have to do your best to convert it (online or offline). First, make sure the website has all it takes to get to know your company and to ease the decision making for your potential customers. Make the website totally reflect the image you’d like to convey about your business - lots of researches back up the fact people are much more willing to buy from a company they care about. Second, make sure that the navigation is straightforward and intuitive, and your contact/location details are really easy to find. Finally, make it load fast. Confusing navigation, outdated details and any page taking forever to load can have a repellent effect on your potential customers. In times when mobile searches are surpassing desktop, and Google is starting mobile-first indexing, shifting the way it ranks results - it is also an absolute must to make your website mobile-friendly, so make sure you pass the test and have no obvious issues like too small tap targets, annoying pop-ups and significant difference between mobile and desktop content of pages. The Tip: A convenient thing to do (if applicable) is to add a store-locator to your contact page. Your Key Business Info Local search engines use your NAP (Name, Address and Phone trinity) to validate the existence and legitimacy of your business. Not only you should fill it out well initially - you should update it consistently: listing detected at false business address and mismatch NAP are in top 3 among negative rankings factors according to MOZ, so the information available to search engines should never be a mess. Google My Business And Social Networks: Start with filling out your Google My Business profile thoroughly, if it exists - make sure to claim it and make any necessary edits: check the contact info and revise all other details - any changes in working hours? A new payment method available? Nice! Make sure the information aligns perfectly across all channels - including your website and all social networks, and make a habit of proactively keeping that information up-to-date; it really pays off! Local Citations: Submit your business to local business listings/directories/review sites highly relevant to your target area and neighborhood (or claim the existing listings). Same way, make sure your details are consistent across the whole local ecosystem, and check for duplicate listings - you definitely don’t want those. Be ready to put some extra effort into using the full potential of the top local listing. The Expert Citation Survey from BrightLocal revealed 5 most important aspects in citations, aside from NAP: Website link Appropriate category Working hours Thorough description List of services But you can also think over the details that would be the most applicable and useful for your specific business and your potential searchers: for some it may be a decisive factor if you accept credit cards or if your pizza-place is dog-friendly. Providing the details searchers are likely to seek will help you find your way to their screens. Last, but not least: make sure to have eye-catchy and appealing photos (both from the inside and from immediate surroundings), as the places with unsightly photos are more likely to be scrolled by. The Tip: Run a local Keyword Difficulty check for your niche keywords with a tool like Rank Tracker to see which directories/listings are more likely to appear among the top results in your neighborhood, and focus on filling those up foremost. Schema Local schema markup allows you to do a whole range of things these days, with thousands of properties to indicate your working hours or price-range, to display your star rating or event schedule. It is being used by search engines to not only see the data on your website, but understand it, and return more digestible results. It can make your business stand out among the results with an informative rich snippet; and if you consider user behavior to be somewhat of a ranking factor - you can see how it may improve your click-through rate and thus make the search engines consider your website to be a nice fit, and promote it in perspective. Finally, this is extremely convenient for a searcher to see the whole picture. The Tip: Think of the most searched-for aspect and mark it up with schema: if you’re a venue - add the events schedule, if it’s a how-to guide - indicate the approximate amount of time it’ll take, if you are aiming at 'near me' searches - don’t forget to indicate operating hours. Reviews The one thing about local SEO that is not entirely under your control - is reviews; yet, it’s an absolute essential. Nice reviews work as a social proof for your business, as people tend to rely on those making the purchasing decisions (according to the recent survey conducted by BrightLocal - 84% of people trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation). Apart from that, the number and diversity of reviews is considered to play a certain role in your rankings, too. As I say not entirely - there is still a lot you can do about it. According to the same survey mentioned above - 7 out of 10 consumers will leave a review for a business if they're asked to; so the first direction in which you should put your efforts is encouraging your customers to submit reviews (by just asking, by offering a treat or any other kind of incentive). However, keep in mind: while some review sites are fine with you steering your customers into their direction, some may consider that fraudulent, so make sure to check the policies of the sites, and adjust your tactics respectively. It is as natural to receive a bad review once in a while, but the crucial thing here is to never ignore it. In fact, a wise solution would be to take a proactive approach to managing your reputation and to monitor what people are saying about you with a tool like Awario: it can collect all kinds of mentions across social networks, platforms and the Web; and you, in turn, can detect and handle any issue right away, and, possibly, prevent some by keeping an eye on the overall sentiment around your business. Here’s a vivid proof of the importance of social media listening, a short story from Search Engine People about a bad review detected in time and managed the right way: The Tip: Apart from reputation management, social media listening may help you detect the influencers in your niche, and this can be a great opportunity for a collaboration of any kind. Hyper-Local Markers & Content At times, you may find yourself targeting an area that lacks a definite name or clear boundaries, or may have an informal name that its inhabitants are accustomed to. It may not be as effective to target the neighborhood by how it’s named on the map, if that’s not what locals type into Google. That’s where you bring the hyper-local SEO into play: a fine way to reach locals is to find such touch-points and, perhaps, enroll some local terminology into your content. To be easily found, add the name of your hyper-local neighborhood to the end of your business name and to its description in Google My Business and other local listings, and optimize your local landing page with it: the URL, the title and H1-tags, image-ALTs and page content. The Tip: While optimizing hyper-locally, make sure Google Maps has your neighborhood defined correctly, or use the Google MapMaker to submit an edit. Update: Google closed down MapMaker at the end of March this year. To make any changes to a listing you should now click on “Suggest an edit” either in Maps or in the local Knowledge Panel. (Hat tip: Nick Rink from Smart Local UK) This also involves understanding local values and lifestyle, and knowing the local holidays. For instance, you may know how in some countries people are throwing neighborhood carnivals - perhaps there’s a way to blend that into your marketing strategy or at least think of a holiday-spirit offer to your local community? A great cause to cover in your local blog, too! Sharing local values and providing content really relevant to your local audience (be it a blog or a Twitter) can emphasize your company’s authenticity, as well as gain you additional traffic and visibility. The Tip: Sponsoring a local event can be a worthy move to get covered by local press, gain local backlinks and raise awareness of your business. Near Me Searches One more thing you shouldn’t neglect is 'near me' searches. And here’s why: The searches are increasingly becoming mobile, and mobile search is more likely to be local in intent; it’s also quite natural for on-the-go searchers to look for a business of any kind, with the proximity to location being one of the main factors. Optimizing for such searches can especially be a win for multi-location businesses which have several stores or offices. The guidelines are pretty intuitive: you should make sure that you have separate landing pages optimized for each location, that the address and phone details for each are correct, prominent and are indicated in easy-to-index format. Don’t forget the operating hours! Positive Google reviews are likely to have the impact on ranking well for 'nearby' searches. What’s more - even if your place is not the closest one to the searcher, good reviews may be your chance to appear on the searcher’s screen due to sorting by rating. The Tip: Ranking well for 'near me' queries can also be backed up with the backlinks to local landings, featuring searched location in anchor. Additional Opportunities The competition for ranking locally has been constantly growing ever since the Local Pack update, when the 7-pack has collapsed into a truly competitive 3-pack. While being listed in the cherished pack can be your number-one goal - it’s about time to expand the area of focus and think of other kinds of opportunities to increase your visibility and make your business shine bright. For instance, video is one of the best formats for storytelling that can make people feel related to your company. The number of ways to incorporate it into your strategy is only limited by your imagination: you can add a 'welcome' video to your homepage, produce 'how-to' videos related to your niche, share company insights with your audience and do many other things - ranking among the Universal Search results or in Video tab can be a great bonus. Same with images; and what’s more - it also can help you humanize the company if you create a nice Team page with photos, or provide a virtual tour to your manufacture to add credibility. Bottom Line Revising the aspects covered above, you can analyze and improve the way your website performs, manage the way your company is being perceived online and take a well-deserved place in the local ecosystem, especially if you are genuinely willing to contribute into the community and share local values. Just be attentive, be adventurous, and closely keep track of your progress to see what works best for your business.

Before they were able to shut it down, the Google Docs phishing attack had spread like wildfire, compromising the email accounts of those affected. It was bad news for Google, but probably couldn’t have come at a better time for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), who launched the cloud and security focused Windows 10 S the day before. How the Google Docs Phishing Attack Works The Google Docs team took to Twitter early yesterday afternoon to warn users of a Google Docs phishing attack that begins as an email invitation to view a shared Google Doc. The email usually came from a known contact, and the link goes to the legitimate Google sign-in page. As the user logs into their Google account, they’re prompted to authorize something called “Google Docs” to manage their Gmail email account. The problem is “Google Docs” was actually a cleverly named app — nothing to do with Google at all — and once it’s given those permissions, it goes to work. The victim’s contact list is used to send the Google Docs phishing email to their contacts. And with the privileges to read, send and delete their emails, the “Google Docs” app operators had open access to the email accounts of those affected. That means sensitive information was potentially exposed and in addition, having control of the Gmail account means the potential for online services linked to that account to be compromised. The genius of this hack is that it made use of genuine Google services instead of trying to re-direct users to a fake website. Perfect Timing for Microsoft Google engineers were on the case quickly to shut it down and minimize the damage. Yesterday evening, they posted an update on Twitter: “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. If you think you clicked on a fraudulent email, visit g.co/SecurityCheckup and remove apps you don’t recognize.” Still, the Google Docs phishing attack couldn’t have come at a more perfect time for Microsoft. Chromebooks running Google’s Chrome OS and using Google Docs have been taking over the educational PC market, pushing out Windows. The big draw is cost, ease of use and security.

You can choose among three versions: a free trial, pro, and super pro version. The app integrates Google Analytics, AdWords, Facebook Ads, Bing Ads, and other platforms. Keep in mind that the service is not integrated with Yandex.Direct in case you target the CIS countries in your online marketing campaigns. Use Google Sheets To Export Supermetrics Data We used Google Chrome to prepare this article. The convenient way to receive the data is to create a Google Sheet. Follow these simple steps: 1. Open A New Sheet On Your Google Drive 2. Open An “Add-ons” Tab And Select “Get Add-ons” 3. Search For “Youtube”, Select Supermetrics, And Install It 4. Start Supermetrics And Select “Youtube” In The “Data Source” Menu And Select Your Account 5. Allow Supermetrics Access To Data 6. Select The Video(-s) For Analysis, E.g. Top Videos 7. Select Dates 8. Select The Period That You Want To Compare Your Data To If Applicable 9. Select Metrics For Analysis, E.g. Video Views, Shares, Likes, And Total Time Watched (Minutes) 10. Split To Rows And Columns To Compose A Table 11. Click On “Get Data To Table” 12. Check Out The Exported Data. See The Sample Below: If you have many videos and a large amount of data to think over, the aforementioned approach will simplify the process and help you group and analyze the key metrics. These data will be collected in a single table and clearly show what videos were popular, what got most subscribers, etc. Based on this, you can understand how to continue working with the channel. What Is Next? Business cannot share video content effectively without an understanding of its audience and people’s needs. Therefore, online projects that promote the video on YouTube should analyze their channel performance. The actions described above will help you evaluate your content’s quality and its usefulness to your audience. After you have gathered the metrics, you should analyze whether you reached your KPIs or not. Either way, you may have a room for optimizing the video for your channel. It makes sense to consider the following aspects. Title Optimize your title by adding the keywords. This will help you attract the users and increase CTR. Make sure that the chosen keywords describe your content or else you will have many clicks, but the audience’s engagement will remain low. Tags You should add relevant tags to your videos. It is recommended to select from 5 to 10 tags, including keywords. Description Make sure to add descriptions under each video. On the one hand, this helps users understand whether to watch a particular video or not. On the other hand, such content gets to the recommended videos more often. Video Cover Image Users often pay more attention to the cover images than to descriptions, so make sure yours are bright and attractive. Transcript Transcription helps YouTube understand what your video is about, its topic, and so on. The more the platform knows about your content, the more often it is recommended to the relevant audience. Last but not least, consider that more popular channels range higher, as compared to videos shared by a new channel. The effective thing to do is to distinguish your YouTube channel from the others. In other words, think about its branding. The first steps may include creating a slogan, animated logo, page’s description, and playlists.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News World News Families of San Bernardino shooting sue Facebook, Google, Twitter Shares1 Fri, 5 May 2017-03:36am , Reuters Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the tech giants permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The plaintiffs assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the plaintiffs say. A spokeswoman for Twitter declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook and Google could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the most recent lawsuit. U.S. federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

All that's in that email is a link. You click it, because of course you do. You're taken to a login page, where you enter your credentials. Then, that site turns out to be fake and collects your password. Congratulations, you've been phished. Phishing is a time honoured way to get your login credentials or access to one of your accounts. The idea behind phishing is extremely simple: It's about tricking you into handing over your information so no actual hack is necessary. Historically, this means sending you an email and hoping you click on it. That link leads to a site the phisher has set up that's supposed to look like the real site's login page. Once you log in, the site saves your username and password. This has been going on since the '90s, when the warez community used phishing emails to snag people's AOL passwords. Back then, hackers could easily trick people into clicking on just about anything because that's just how the internet used to work, but nowadays, we're all more vigilant, right? If yesterday's Google Docs phishing scam is any indication, no. The premise in yesterday's phishing attempt was the same as it's ever been: You get an email that looks like it's from a friend so you click on it. In this case, it was trying to look like someone wanted to share a Google Doc with you. You click the link, and that directs you to the real Google sign-in page. It's the legit Google page, so you sign in. The phishing attempt comes next, when you grant permissions to what ends up being the phishing app. It's a clever play on the usual process, even if it isn't totally doing something new. Here it is in action: @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 As sophisticated and fancy-sounding as this attempt was, there were some indications that it was bogus. For one, the googledocs.g-docs.win URL is sketchy, but beyond that, you've most certainly already given Google permission to access your account, because it's Google, so regranting that makes no sense. Thankfully, in this particular case, you can at least revoke access to that phishing program. We've seen similar versions of this same thing over the years, but phishing attempts are getting better and better at reproducing the login pages of popular sites. One recent attempt used a fake attachment to redirect you do a Google login page, and another way back in 2014 did almost the exact same thing as this week's hack, replicating a Google Docs login page. That DNC hack last year? Phishing. Over the years, popular phishing targets have also included PayPal accounts, eBay, and just about every major US bank. What makes these modern attempts more sophisticated? Namely that they're getting better at hiding what they're doing so the usual scanning techniques don't work as well. Phishing attempts are getting better at replicating site login pages like Google or even your bank, they often use tricks to mask the true URL of a link, and they're getting better at making messages seem like they're from a real person. In the Google Docs case, it was all about playing into expectations of what a phishing attempt looked like, then using that alongside Google's OAuth login system to catch you off guard. So, what's an otherwise tech savvy person to do? Continue to not click on any weird links in your email, regardless of who you think sent it. Chances are your friends don't just send you an email with a link in it, and if they do, you should probably ask them to change that weird behaviour. Otherwise, if a link in an email does look weird but you just can't stop yourself from clicking on it, don't click the link, but head to the site in question by manually typing the URL and then log in that way. If you must, you can usually right-click a URL or mouseover it to see the true destination, but even that scanning method might not save you these days. More importantly, if you want to use your phishing vigilance for good and want to help people moving forward, the venerable SwiftOnSecurity has put together a collection of phishing reporting tools so you can report sketchy links so other people don't fall prey to those attempts. Just remember, don't click shady links in your email from a company. Don't click weird links in emails from your friends and family. Don't click links in emails from your bank, Google or anyone else where you could otherwise just log into a site to get the information that's supposedly in that email.

Now that Android Wear is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table comparing every watch. You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device. The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However, the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch snfaces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395. The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform. Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bābā ghanūj Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging.

Everything You Need To Know About This Week's Massive Phishing Worm Adam Clark Estes May 5, 2017, 7:30am ⋅ Filed to:  google google docs hackers hacking security Share Over a million Gmail users got hit by a phishing worm yesterday, sending the security world into a cacophony of screams and laughter. Screams, because the attack looked like it came from Google itself. Laughter, because the attack looked like it came from Google itself. Image: Gizmodo / Google While some chin-scratching observers called it "sophisticated", Wednesday's worm was dreadfully simple on the surface. The attack started with a convincing email that contained the same language as a Google Docs invitation along with the the same button Google uses to open the document. (Only frequent Google Docs users would have noticed that the overall design of the email was not quite right.) Clicking the link would take the user to a series of pages that looked just like the real Google sign-in process. Why? Because they actually were real Google sign-in pages. Long story short, the hacker built an app called "Google Docs" and registered it with Google. For whatever reason, Google allowed the app to use its OAuth process and, in turn, trick lots and lots of people into handing over their accounts to a hacker. One thing Google did do right was shut down this phishing worm very quickly. According to members of the Google security team on Reddit, only 30 minutes passed from the time the attack was reported until the fake Google Docs app got nuked. Nevertheless, Google says that 0.1 per cent of all Gmail users were affected, and while that seems like a very small percentage, Google says there are over a billion Gmail users. (That's where the "over one million" figure comes from.) It's so far unclear how the hacker managed to get a fake Google Docs into Google's OAuth ecosystem. Google says that it has ways of preventing this, although the company declined to comment on exactly how. Which makes sense, since Google wouldn't want to reveal all of its defences to hackers. "Google detects and reviews potential OAuth abuse and takes down apps that violate our User Data Policy, such as impersonating a Google app," a Google spokesperson explained Gizmodo in an email. "Note that a real Google app should be directly accessed from a Google site or installed from the Google Play or Apple App stores." For the poor souls who authorised the fake Google Docs app, there's some bad news. We know that the attacker accessed victims' contacts, because the worm spread by sending more emails to those contacts. Authorising the app also would have given the hacker access to the contents of the victims' inboxes. (Remember, the DNC hack was traced back to a phishing attack.) Theoretically, the attacker could use the inbox contents to go after individuals' bank accounts, even within that narrow window of access. "If it was planned and they knew that certain email addresses were tied to certain banks, [the hackers] would have had plenty of time time to do that," Sven Dietrich, an IEEE senior member and associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told Gizmodo in an interview. "The authorisation doesn't get you the usernames and passwords," Dietrich said, adding that hackers could have also executed a script that recorded keystrokes. There is some good news. A purported copy of the source code makes it seem like the phishing worm was simply designed to propagate itself, although it's possible that more malicious code was involved in the attack. At this point, time will tell how much damage this hacker caused with his stupidly simple phishing worm. If you were one of the poor saps who fell for this scam, you should change your passwords and double-check which third-party apps have been granted access by using Google's Security Checkup. Heck, everybody might as well do the checkup — just for fun! Victims should also think hard about what's in their inbox, since there's a chance that data might end up for sale on the dark web in six months. Here's another tip, now that we're all paying attention to our internet hygiene. Instead of using your regular Gmail account to authorise apps through Google OAuth, set up a shell account to do that. This way, if you do fall for a phishing scam, hackers won't have access to all of your friends and emails and deepest darkest secrets. That shell account is also a good one to use for password recovery, too. "Spread things over multiple accounts to contain any compromise to a smaller subset," Dietrich said. "It's a bit like George Costanza when he says, 'My worlds are colliding!' You don't want your worlds to collide. You want to compartmentalise." As far as we know, the hacked credentials haven't been used to break into a million people's bank accounts yet. And since Google quickly shut down the fake Google Docs app, the hacker only had access to victims' accounts for a few minutes. Nevertheless, a few minutes is plenty of time to steal a lot of data, so the story could be far from over.

Adobe software has always been expensive, but at least it was one upfront cost. As it turns out, we were right. Another annual price increase for Creative Cloud is happening a month from now, and it represents the latest jump in a nearly 250 per cent price rise for some Creative Cloud plans since it started. Microsoft's Surface Laptop: The Gizmodo Hands On Alex Cranz 03 May 2017 12:30 PM The Surface Laptop might not have turned many heads if it had been the first mobile computer from Microsoft. It's not as radical and influential as the Surface Pro or as crazy looking as the Surface Book. From afar the silver Surface Laptop looks like something as easily made by Apple or Asus as by Microsoft. It feels like that too, with the same heft as a powerful premium laptop like the 2016 MacBook Pro or the exceptional Asus ZenBook 3. Despite being a good looking hunk of hardware, the Surface Laptop is remarkable for how perfectly mundane it in light of recent Microsoft computer products. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive San Bernardino terrorist attack victims' families sue Twitter, Google and Facebook Thursday May 4, 2017 at 2:35 PM May 4, 2017 at 4:19 PM Families of three victims killed in the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino terrorist attack sued three media giants Wednesday, accusing Twitter, Google and Facebook of "knowingly and recklessly" providing Islamic State with a platform for years to spread propaganda, raise funds and attract new recruits. Shea Johnson Staff Writer @DP_Shea Families of three victims killed in the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino terrorist attack sued three media giants Wednesday, accusing Twitter, Google and Facebook of "knowingly and recklessly" providing Islamic State with a platform for years to spread propaganda, raise funds and attract new recruits. The federal lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of relatives for Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos. Each were San Bernardino County Department of Public Health employees and co-workers of shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. Filed in U.S. District Court's Central District of California, Western Division, the suit alleges that Twitter, Facebook and Google, through subsidiary YouTube, were liable for aiding and abetting acts of international terrorism and providing material support to terrorists, among other violations. The companies are accused of having "provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits," the lawsuit reads. "This material support has been instrumental to the rise of ISIS and has enabled it to carry out or cause to be carried out, numerous terrorist attacks, including" the San Bernardino attack, which killed 14 and injured 22. A Facebook spokesperson said Thursday that the company is committed to providing a service where users feel safe. "There is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it's reported to us," the spokesperson said via email. "We sympathize with the victims and their families." Twitter and Google didn't directly respond to emails requesting comment. But Twitter, which has rules prohibiting threats of violence and the promotion of terrorism, has suspended 636,248 accounts between Aug. 1, 2015 and Dec. 31 for violations relating to promoting terrorism. Between July 1 and Dec. 31 alone, Twitter suspended nearly 377,000 accounts. Yet attorneys for the plaintiffs claim in the lawsuit that ISIS accounts on Twitter had grown at an "astonishing rate" since 2010 and, until recently, its official accounts were unfettered. If it weren't for Twitter, Google and Facebook, attorneys argued, "the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible." Similar court complaints have been filed in the Pulse nightclub attack in Orlando where 49 people were killed and in the attacks in Paris that killed 130. In a June 18 report by Fortune on the Paris attacks lawsuit, interviews with legal experts by Ars Technica were cited to explain how that suit likely had little chance to succeed. The 1996 Communications Decency Act "establishes that user-generated content on digital platforms cannot be used in proceedings against the platforms," Fortune noted.

Safe Computing | 04 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (0) Google Halts Massive Phishing Attack: Check Your Account by Adam C. Engst Earlier this week, a huge phishing campaign targeted email users with a message that appeared to be an invitation from a known correspondent to join a Google Doc. However, clicking the link to open the file instead requested that you grant access to an app that looked like Google Docs, but was instead an app that sent spam to people in your contact list. The attack was well-engineered, so although there were giveaways, such as the original message being sent to hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com and BCC’d to you, it suckered lots of people. Google reacted quickly, disabling the phishing campaign in an hour and releasing this statement: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. Later, Google followed up with another statement: We realize people are concerned about their Google accounts, and we’re now able to give a fuller explanation after further investigation. We have taken action to protect users against an email spam campaign impersonating Google Docs, which affected fewer than 0.1 percent of Gmail users. We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions, including removing the fake pages and applications, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, and other anti-abuse systems. We were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour. While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed. There’s no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup. Although 0.1 percent of Gmail users sounds small, it’s likely well over 1 million people, since Google reported that Gmail had 1 billion users as of February 2016. At this point, as Google says, there’s nothing you need to do to protect yourself from this attack. But it’s a good excuse to check your Google account to verify everything connected to it. Start at the Google Security Checkup page, which walks you through checking your account recovery information, connected devices, account permissions, app passwords, and two-step verification settings. In particular, in Check Your Account Permissions, make sure to remove access for any app that you don’t recognize. Click an app to see more details about when you authorized it to access your Google account and what information it can access. When you get to Check Your App Passwords, you may be able to revoke most or even all of them. Google lets you generate passwords for apps that don’t support its two-step verification system, but there’s no need for them in any Google-branded apps in iOS 8.3 or later, and OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite or later. Similarly, setting up Gmail in Mail in iOS doesn’t require an app-specific password. I apparently haven’t used any of the app-specific passwords I created since 2015, so I can probably delete them all. I’m not sure there’s much of a moral to this story, apart from encouraging you to evaluate what you read carefully, both in email and on Web pages that you might click through to from an email message, particularly if they’re asking you for a password or other personal information. Phishing messages almost always have spelling errors, grammatical flubs, or obvious oddities with the To and From lines — no large company will make those kinds of mistakes. If an email message ever feels wrong, navigate to a linked Web page manually rather than clicking through from the message. But don’t get too paranoid. The vast majority of email that lands in your Inbox is entirely innocuous, and worrying about a phishing attack every time you open a message is no way to live.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Last year, Google jumped into the mix and immediately rose to the top ranks, with the Pixel claiming a spot next to the iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best phones money could buy in 2016. And with that, Apple's place on the top shelf started to look more crowded than it had in recent years. But 2017 is a new year, and Apple isn't done feeling the heat—the newly-released Galaxy S8 is pound-for-pound the best Android phone we've ever tested, and maybe even the best phone we've ever used, period. And it's not just Samsung that's upping the competition, either. Google is on pace to release a follow-up to its crowd-pleading Pixel sometime later this year, and you better believe the tech giant learned a thing or two about building and marketing a winning smartphone after its inaugural run in 2016. If Apple hopes to secure its footing at the top of the smartphone food chain, here's a list of what it needs to do to keep the iPhone from slipping out of the hearts and minds of shoppers looking to upgrade to the next big thing. Keep the fingerprint sensor on the front, but put it beneath the screen itself The iPhone 7 was the first iPhone to replace its iconic home button with a pressure-sensitive, capacitive facsimile that mimicked the look and feel of the original button. According to industry sources, however, the next iPhone is rumored to feature a display that takes up the entire front side of the phone—just like the extra-tall display on the Samsung Galaxy S8. After Samsung displaced the Galaxy S8's home button with a ginormous screen, its engineers decided that the fingerprint scanner would now live on the back of the device—right next to the S8's primary camera. The problem is that the fingerprint scanner on the S8 is roughly the height and width as the phone's camera. What's worse is that the camera is right smack-dab in the middle of the S8's back casing, which is the spot your finger is naturally inclined to go when it wants to unlock the phone. The next iPhone is rumored to feature a display that takes up the entire front side of the phone. In order to avoid the same smudgy-camera fate, Apple will need to position the next iPhone's fingerprint scanner more strategically. Fortunately, according to the iPhone rumor mill, Apple allegedly figured out a way to keep the scanner on the front of the iPhone despite its edge-to-edge, bezel-less display: by putting it underneath the display itself. If this rumored high-tech trickery proves true, the next iPhone will see all of the benefits of a massive screen without forcing its users to re-train their fingers to unlock their phone. It's an easy way to score some points on Samsung, The size and placement of the Galaxy S8's fingerprint scanner doomed it from the start.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) Make the camera faster If there's one area where the Google Pixel has an edge over its contemporaries, it's camera speed. The reason for the Pixel's zippy shutter speed has to do with some ingenious software. Essentially, whenever the Pixel's camera app is open, it's always snapping rapid-fire photos. The only ones that are saved, however, are the photos taken when a user decides to take a picture. This is the sort of software development that Apple should be looking to steal (or, ahem, adopt) moving forward. Sure—when it comes to speed, the iPhone 7's camera ain't exactly slow, but if there's an opportunity to close the gap between you and your opponent, you've got to take it—even if it means poaching your opponent's winning formula. Google's camera takes advantage of some nifty software trickery to make it the fastest smartphone camera on the market today.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) Introduce wireless charging Wireless charging has been a key feature of Samsung's Galaxy series for several years—so long a time, in fact, that it's downright silly that Apple has yet to incorporate similar technology in its iPhone lineup. It's downright silly that Apple has yet to incorporate wireless charging. If you've never known the splendor of wireless charging, just imagine an office desk or a night stand free of cables. Better yet, imagine a bedtime routine that doesn't involve getting down on your hands and knees while you fumble around for a spare outlet. When a new Galaxy phone is released, its wireless charging functionality tends to be overshadowed by camera performance, raw hardware specs, and overall battery life. But it's high time Apple catches up with its chief rival and introduces similar functionality for the iPhone (just don't expect an official Apple charging pad to come cheap). The iPhone 7 is the first iPhone to feature water resistance—and hopefully not the last.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) Keep the water resistance Although Samsung wasn't the first to make a water-resistant smartphone, its Galaxy flagships were the first smartphones to make water resistance an expectation rather than a bonus feature. Needless to say, it took Apple a while to catch up. (Sensing a pattern yet?) Both of the latest iPhones can withstand rain, spills, and accidental drops in the toilet. With the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple finally gave its base what it spent years clamoring for: Both of the latest iPhones can withstand rain, spills, and accidental drops in the toilet. But why stop there? Why bother reverting back to the dark days of sticking your waterlogged iPhone in a bag of rice, wondering if that ill-fated puddle will ultimately claim the life of your precious phone? Besides, if the first Pixel is any indication, Google might not outfit its next smartphone with water resistance. If Apple really wants to sweep Google's leg, this might be a good place to gain the upper-hand. For Apple, staying in front of Samsung and Google is just as much about incorporating new ideas as it is about maintaining the ideas that have proven to work. Water resistance is no longer a nifty add-on feature—it's something people expect. More crucially, it's something people will be disappointed not to have anymore. Real advice from real experts.

The first such project, Voice Kit, promises artificial intelligence – a term that here means access to voice recognition and natural language APIs – from a Raspberry Pi 3 circuit board wrapped in a cardboard box. It amounts to a handcrafted homage to Google Home, at something less than Home's $114 price tag. Google's relationship with hardware, apart from Chromebooks and Chromecasts, has not gone very well. It first foray into bare metal, the Google Search Appliance, is being phased out this year after 15 years. Its Google Mini met its end in 2012. Its 2011 $12.5bn fling with Motorola ended in a breakup. Google's pricey Pixel phones have sold poorly. Other Google hardware has fared even less well: the Nexus Q streaming media device, the Nexus Player set top box, and Google Glass have all bombed. The Chromebook Pixel has been discontinued and the Pixel C, despite some nice reviews, remains a curiosity. So perhaps there's some wisdom in some assembly required. Featuring the same bespoke design aesthetic as the Google Cardboard VR goggles, Voice Kit consists of a Voice Hardware Accessory on Top (HAT) module, a speaker, sensors, and wires. Once connected to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, it can communicate with cloud services or operate locally. Developers can use the device with the Google Assistant SDK (which powers Google Home) or Cloud Speech API, among other cloud services. They can also avail themselves of the more extensive Android Things SDK for IoT devices. Billy Rutledge, director of AIY Projects at Google, suggests the device can be used to interact with appliances by voice rather than through physical buttons, display screens, or smartphone apps. He also sees it as a way to route voice commands to robots that can accept programmatic instructions. For a glimpse of what the truly dedicated can accomplish with its Assistant SDK, Google and development shop Deeplocal built an automated drink mixer called the Mocktails Mixer. The Voice Kit is being made available to MagPi Magazine subscribers. Those interested in assembling the necessary components can do so through the AIY Projects website. For the lazy or time-constrained, the kit can be bought through Barnes & Noble in the US and UK retailers Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco, and WH Smith. ® Tips and corrections 13 Comments MORE Hardware Ai Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register DARPA seeks SSITH lords to keep hardware from the Dark Side 'Make chips secure', because nobody's thought of that before 5 Comments Popular hacker warkit Metasploit now hacks hardware and cars Coming soon: Cracking IoT kit and industrial control systems 3 Comments Cloud-happy Oracle dodges rumors it is axing its traditional hardware ... as sales of traditional hardware fall Meanwhile, co-CEO Safra Catz joins Team Trump 18 Comments Intel touts bug bounties to hardware hackers Website and Intel Security (McAfee) products excluded from 'Wild West' payouts scheme 2 Comments Newly cloud-tastic Oracle sees hardware sales droop Analysis Is public cloud focus punishing on-premises biz? 5 Comments Spotify seeks hardware boffins For something you never knew you wanted 18 Comments Whitepapers Secure Mobile Development Best Practices Covering the vulnerabilities hackers might use to launch an attack, and remediation tips that you can use to build security into your app. Hybrid and Public Cloud for Mission-critical Deployment Red Hat is a modern-day success story; it’s open-source software (OSS) model has now penetrated nearly every layer of IT systems that were once proprietary.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Security The Google Docs attack took over a million Gmail accounts in an hour Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 4th, 2017 at 3:46 PM Share Tweet Yesterday, a phishing attack appeared out of nowhere to infect the inboxes of people across the world. The attack relied on a weakness in Google’s own Apps system to take control of users’ Gmail accounts, and send out the spam link to users’ address books. The result was a hack that spread like wildfire: according to Google, a million accounts were compromised in just one hour. Don't Miss: This sophisticated phishing scam has the entire internet terrified The hack started with an email, send from a known contact, that invited you to click a link to see a Google Doc they’d shared with you. Google does send an email when a contact shares a Google Doc, so it’s not an unusual email to receive. Once you clicked on the link inside, you were sent to a legitimate Google Apps page. It asked you to authorise an app called “Google Docs” to read, send and delete emails, which is the problem. Google Docs was a fake app, controlled by the attacker. Speaking to the BBC, Google said that removed the attack “within approximately one hour”, via “removing fake pages and applications”. “While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed,” Google said. “There’s no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup.” However, in the time it took for Google to shut down the attack, it infected a million users. Nothing apart from email access seems to have been stolen, but that could potentially be problematic. Gmail is often used as the recovery email for other accounts, like Amazon, Apple or Facebook accounts. Users who were infected by the scam may want to keep a close eye on any important services for the next few days, and consider enabling two-factor authentication.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 74 Plus 1 on G+ 313 Share on Facebook 119 Share on Twitter Total Shares506 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Stock Android is always buttery smooth. Even when it isn't. Louis Smith I'm in the same boat. Sold my OP3, Loved the phone, but someone else wanted it. I just kept on going back to my N6P. Hopefully the next one will be the same size as the 6P Matt He wants to be exclusive. He's a jealous Pixel lover.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

Google is warning users Wednesday, May 3, 2017, to beware of a phishing scam spread by a fraudulent invitation to share a Google Doc. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google said it shut down an email spam campaign that impersonated its online file service, Google Docs. According to online reports — in particular, a detailed user thread on Reddit — clicking on an emailed share link, purportedly from a known source, was taking users to a site that asked permission for a fake app calling itself “Google Docs” to access their accounts. If they agreed, the app would then send additional copies of the original email to the users’ contacts. Earlier reports suggested the attack was a phishing scam potentially aimed at harvesting personal information and maybe even Google login credentials. But in a statement late Wednesday, Google said that while the campaign accessed and used contact information, no other data was apparently exposed. Consumer Guide: Avoiding Scams & Schemes » Google said it was able to stop the campaign in about an hour. It has disabled offending accounts, removed fake pages and updated its Safe Browsing feature, which issues warnings when users visit dangerous sites. Users don’t have to take additional action, although Google encouraged those who want to be extra safe to run its security check feature. One telltale sign for identifying the spam email: It appears to be directed to the address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com, and is only blind copied to the recipient. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) reminded users that they play a critical role in protecting their organizations and themselves from cyber threats. Users should: Be careful when clicking directly on links in emails, even if the sender appears to be known; attempt to verify web addresses independently (e.g., contact your organization’s helpdesk or search the Internet for the main website of the organization or topic mentioned in the email). Exercise caution when opening email attachments. Be particularly wary of compressed or ZIP file attachments. Immediately report any suspicious emails to your information technology (IT) helpdesk, security office, or email provider.

Google shortcuts use personalization and rich content to build next-gen local discovery tool Machine learning-driven results entirely bypass the traditional search box. Greg Sterling on May 4, 2017 at 4:10 pm More Kashin / Shutterstock.com Several weeks ago, without much fanfare, Google added new shortcut icons to its mobile app and website. They appear immediately under the search box to provide quick access to current weather, sports, entertainment and restaurant information. These are essentially prepackaged queries, using a range of data behind the scenes, to replace typing with tapping. These shortcuts have quietly turned Google’s local search and discovery experience into a powerful competitor to Yelp. Below is a screen grab of the conventional local-mobile search experience for “lunch near me.” Users see a local pack, a map, organic links and images down the first page (not pictured). Here’s what it looks like — pretty familiar: But when you tap the “eat & drink” shortcut, you get a different experience that brings a much richer set of results. Also on display is the full range of Google’s mobile and location data capabilities. Google is providing personalized recommendations and offering a plethora of other choices and options. These are grouped by interest, cuisines, atmosphere and various attributes. All of this is driven and accompanied by rich data. This is also an argument for adding more enhanced data as part of your local SEO strategy. Google presents “places for you,” based on your location history — your actual visits to other restaurants that establish patterns and preferences. Google also uses machine learning to group venues into useful categories by interest and attributes: “popular with foodies,” “best lunch,” “recently opened,” “great beers” and so on. It’s not clear how much usage this is getting; Google hasn’t done much to build awareness other than place the shortcuts under the search bar. But it offers a dramatically improved experience that eliminates the need to do multiple queries and click around. It’s like a super carousel on AI. (Note: I didn’t say “steroids.”) The experience represents a template for other kinds of mobile search results beyond the four categories currently present. Shopping and Travel come immediately to mind. Android features more shortcuts than iOS. Currently, you can buy movie tickets via the entertainment shortcut. We can expect more transactional capabilities like this to roll out to other categories. Right now there are no ads, but assume there will be if it gains widespread usage. If it indeed does gain momentum, we could see large numbers of people entirely bypass the search box in certain key categories.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN Google Chrome review A powerful and customizable browser that can be tailored to your needs By Mark Wilson Software  Shares Our Verdict If you're not worried by the privacy concerns associated with Google, this is the best web browser on the market. For Endlessly extendable Lots and lots of tweaking options Beta builds available Against Privacy concerns thanks to Google links Very memory hungry Not the fastest performer out there If you’re fully immersed in the Google ecosystem, using Chrome makes perfect sense. It ties in with your Google account, allowing you to sync settings and bookmarks between computers – and even different devices thanks to mobile versions of the browser. Available for Mac, Windows and Linux, as well as iOS and Android, Chrome's cross-platform support gives it access to a large number of users, and it's little wonder that it proves so enduringly popular. Google Chrome Download here: https://www.google.com/chrome/ Type: Web browser Developer: Google Operating system: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS Version: 58.0 The current version of Chrome complies with more web standards than any other browser, and a frequent update cycle means that security issues and other bugs are knocked on the head quickly. If you find that there's a feature missing from Chrome, or you like the idea of adding extra functions to websites you use frequently, you have the option of using extensions to do just that, and there's a huge selection available in the Chrome Web Store. If you like the idea of trying new tools first, there’s also a beta channel available that provides early access to new builds of the browser. Chrome also does a superb job of managing tabs. As well as intelligently resizing tabs – and providing a pinning option for easy access – the browser also stores individual tabs in memory separately, so if one crashes, it shouldn't take the rest with it. User experience In terms of its basic look, Chrome offers few surprises. This is, after all, a piece of software designed to display web pages, and those web pages should be the focus of things rather than the browser itself. With this in mind, Chrome does a great job of fading into the background – it is beautifully minimalist. There are few settings that you will need to concern yourself with on a day-to-day basis, but it's easy to change the default search engine, show or hide the bookmarks toolbar, and control the storage of browsing history and cookies. With support for multiple users, and even parental controls, Chrome is a browser for all the family, and the browser of the future.

SAN FRANCISCO: Google accused rival Uber of a "cover up scheme" to steal its self-driving car technology, lobbing a bombshell claim into a high-profile court hearing on Wednesday. According to Google, the selfdriving truck startup company that Uber acquired was part of a ruse concocted by Uber and Antghony Levandowski, the former star Google engineer who now works at Uber. In fact, Levandowski and Uber had already pre-negotiated the terms for Uber to acquire the startup, lawyers for Google’s self-driving car spinout Waymo said in court on Wednesday. "Through discovery we’ve learned that Uber and Levandowski created a cover up scheme for what they were doing. They concocted a story for public consumption," said Waymo’s lawyer Charles Verhoeven. Uber’s alleged conspiracy to build a company before later acquiring it is a large part of Waymo’s bid to stop Uber’s research from self-driving cars. Google pointed to the fact that Levandowski received $250 million in Uber stock the day after he quit Google, and months before his startup, Otto, was acquired by Uber. However the judge pushed back and asked whether Uber could be innocent in all of this and maybe the "worst thing they did is pay a lot of money to hire away a brilliant guy from another competitor". "Here’s the thing. You didn’t sue him. You sued Uber. So what if it turns out that Uber is totally innocent?" Alsup asked.

The Instant Apps feature allows people to use apps without installing them – which leaves more storage available on phones. Facebook taking action to stop livestreamed murders being shared It’s already on certain select devices, including the Google Pixel, and people can opt in by going to their Google settings. A recent discovery from XDA Developers, who took a look at some code in the Google Play Store, has revealed that the feature will be widespread shortly. Their findings have shown that people will be able to opt in to Instant Apps using their Google Play Store email address.

Now, version 10.0 of Allo is rolling out publicly and we’ve managed to enable the feature to see just how it works… Everyone can use an Echo Dot: Just $50! In our teardown of version 5.0, we found that you’d be able to “Generate stickers,” as well as provide feedback to help Google “improve the quality of [their] algorithm.” The strings we found said that you’d be able to “Take a selfie and we’ll automagically generate a sticker pack in your likeness.” After you choose the option to generate a sticker pack in the app, the first thing you’ll be prompted with is a typical front-facing camera view with a pair of “glasses” to fit your eyes in. From there, you snap a picture, wait a few minutes, and a sticker pack based on your appearance will be generated. As you can see, you can choose to “redo” your pack if you’re not satisfied with the results. Or you can save the pack to us in your chats. Check it out: After your sticker pack is generated, though, you also have the option to customize it and tweak it to more perfectly match your own appearance. As you can see below, you can twealk the avatar’s head shape, hair, eyes, facial features, and facial hair. You’ll find the new sticker pack, “inspired” by you, in the same list you find your other stickers packs. And you can use the stickers in chats as usual. While yes, this is another less-than-functionally-compelling new addition to Google Allo, you have to admit it’s a pretty interesting feature. And while it might not add many new users to an app that’s almost a year old and still struggling to gain momentum, it is just plain fun. The feature isn’t out yet, but should become available within a couple weeks. Many of the features that we found evidence of in our teardown of Google Allo 9.0 were enabled right around the time that Google Allo 10.0 (the current version) started rolling out. We’ll have more information on Google Allo 10.0 in our teardown of that version coming soon. Dylan contributed to this article. Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google.

Milpitas is now mulling an upgrade to its more than 10-year-old, outdoor Wi-Fi network and potentially have a new third-party operator manage it. Photo by Ian Bauer By Ian Bauer | ibauer@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group May 4, 2017 at 1:22 pm Ten years ago, Milpitas’ free municipal wireless Internet system was a novel idea involving state-of-the-art technology that sought to provide greater web access to the community. A decade later, Milpitas’ citywide Wi-Fi system and its attendant equipment is still in place but now sits mostly unused. The Milpitas City Council on April 4 received a report about its Wi-Fi network — that still works in city-owned buildings but not outside in the public like parks or in neighborhoods — and advanced an option to issue a request for proposals to see if any interested companies might jump start the system. During a formal presentation covering the history of municipal Wi-Fi here, Mike Luu, the city’s Information Services director, told the council that Milpitas began using San Jose-based Tropos Networks for such services starting in 2003, mainly for police use. “Back then it was for public safety,” Luu said. He added by 2006 Tropos was discontinued in favor of Atlanta-based Earthlink, which took over operations with the objective to grow the network with newer equipment and customer base. In Milpitas, Earthlink invested $1.8 million and expanded the network to 300 nodes — transponder units installed all around town, atop city-owned light poles allowing the public here to access free Wi-Fi. With the new investment, Earthlink started the subscription-based model along with free public Wi-Fi at city sites, according to city staff reports. The subscription-based business model did not attract enough subscribers to sustain operations. By 2008, the city took over operations and ownership of the network. “But to keep and maintain a network of this size, in terms of equipment…it was too much for our internal staff to handle,” Luu said. He added at that time the city went out for an RFP to get somebody else to partner with the city to continue the Wi-Fi project. Luu said Milpitas then decided to partner with Mountain View’s Silicon Valley Unwired — a nonprofit organization backed by Google — to move away from the subscription-based model. But even when the free non-subscription based model was implemented under this system, city staffers noted the adoption rate was low. At its daytime peak usage, city staff said there were about 650 users — or less than 1 percent of city’s more than 70,000 population. By 2013, Luu said Google was no longer focused on a citywide Wi-Fi model. “Wireless wasn’t working for them so they wanted to go and invest in ‘Fiber Cities’,” Luu said. A year later, following the recession and lack of funding to the program, Silicon Valley Unwired and Google opted out of operating and managing the city’s Wi-Fi system. Luu said Google eventually told Milpitas “you can take over the network, own it, do whatever you like.” He added Milpitas’ Wi-Fi is now largely unused. “We still have the equipment on the light poles, but most of them are not operational,” Luu said. This year, with regard to Wi-Fi, he said the city has been solicited by companies interested in picking up where past firms left off. To that end, city staff recommended Milpitas issue a request for proposals for possible Wi-Fi operators. “What that would allow is to bring any companies that want to present their technologies or opportunities or solutions to the city and then staff will evaluate those options, companies and choices and make a recommendation and then bring it. Once that’s approved, the development and installation would begin,” Luu said. Although city staff stated no fiscal impact for this project, Councilman Bob Nunez questioned whether or not Milpitas would suffer a cost. In response, City Manager Tom Williams said he was “a little bit fearful of this agenda item because we were getting ahead of ourselves.” Williams clarified that if the council desired moving forward with an RFP then the city could seek a competitive bid and added as part of the “performance measures” of this document there “will be no cost to the city.” He added city staffers and the Milpitas Telecommunications Commission would return with a recommendation to the council. “At that time, based on the proposals, we will identify a time fiscal impact to the city or not, both directly and indirectly,” Williams said. “Tonight, we’re really trying to provide information and seek the city council’s approval to move forward with an RFP.” He added that he wanted it to be an open, competitive process. Luu also asserted the market was there for a new firm to step in and operate the system. “We will not be putting in any investment…and we still have those wireless access points on the light poles,” Luu said, but added that there were still unknown impacts. Councilman Garry Barbadillo said he believed this project should offer free Internet access to the community, especially allowing greater web access to low-income families and Milpitas Unified School District students. Nunez agreed. “It’s important that we do that for our students and families,” Nunez said. Mayor Rich Tran said he was excited and looked forward to seeing an RFP. But residents like Michael Tsai told the council during public comment that it should be cautious with regard to hidden costs a third-party Wi-Fi may inflict upon the city. “Pretty soon the company’s not managing the network, the company’s managing the city,” Tsai said, adding Milpitas should consult with technical experts before proceeding on any formal agreement. “I think the city should be setting the agenda…there’s definitely a lot at stake here.” In the end, the council voted 3-0 to proceed with the RFP issuance. This week, Luu confirmed the the RFP had not been sent yet. “We are still gathering input from others and our telecommunications commission,” Luu said via email on Monday. He clarified that the city still provides Wi-Fi access at most city buildings. “The RFP will only focus on external areas throughout the city,” Luu added. “The goal is to provide low cost or zero cost (lower speed Wi-Fi) access to residents with the option for higher speed connectivity for businesses and residents.” He said the RFP’s completion and evaluation will likely be done within the next six months. “The project timeline will be determined by the proposer and city through the negotiation process,” Luu said. “…We will be bringing the project back to council for final approval.” Ian Bauer Ian Bauer is the city editor of the Milpitas Post and The Argus.

Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, in the company's Hacking STEM team lab at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The company's relevance in schools in the US is in jeopardy after years of progress by Google. NYT Last week, Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, slipped on a glove made of cardboard and clenched his hand into a fist, causing a robotic hand with fingers made of drinking straws to mimic his movements. The glove was one of several engineering projects built in a makeshift laboratory on Microsoft’s campus. The company spent the past year talking to thousands of teachers and designing high-tech experiments that require mostly low-cost parts. It will give the designs to schools for free so teachers can use them in their lesson plans. The projects are part of a major push the company announced on Tuesday to make its products more attractive to school administrators, students and teachers. The push includes a new version of Microsoft’s Windows operating system for classrooms, tweaks to its Office applications and a new Surface laptop for students in a collection of bold colours. While the dollars available in the education market are compelling enough for big technology companies like Microsoft, classrooms also offer an opportunity to make a first impression on young people who could eventually buy their products. “The second-order effects of education, of being relevant in education, are going to be key for us,” Nadella said in an interview last week. He added, “The devices the kids take to their school, or to their college, is going to be influenced by what they were familiar with.” Microsoft remains a force in classrooms around the globe. But the company’s relevance in schools in the US is in jeopardy after years of progress by Google, whose software dominates sales of new devices in schools. Google has gained ground in public schools by offering a tightly connected system of free classroom apps, lower-cost laptops called Chromebooks and a web-based console that allows schools to remotely manage thousands of student devices. Industry analysts said Microsoft’s initiative was the company’s first credible response to Google’s recent encroachment into education. “I am not going to predict that they are going to take back the entire market or anything like that, but this is the best move that I could have seen them making against Chromebooks,” said J P Gownder, a technology analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, where Microsoft is one of his clients. Some of Microsoft’s moves are intended to make its products more appealing to educators by simplifying them and, in some ways, restricting them. The new version of its operating system, Windows 10 S, will only run applications that have been vetted by Microsoft and placed in its online app store, to prevent students from downloading software that could slow down the performance of their computers. Microsoft has also devised a way for schools to get new computers running on a network quickly, without manually configuring each one, by plugging in a USB memory stick. A Microsoft management system called Intune for Education allows schools to set further limits on classroom computers, like locking them down so students cannot cheat by searching the web during tests. The tools are designed to be easy enough for teachers to use, since many schools do not have dedicated technology administrators. The company is also making full versions of its Office applications, rather than more limited web versions, available to schools for free. It has modified a version of its Microsoft Teams group-chat tool so teachers can collaborate with students. It is also waiving the cost of an educational version of “Minecraft,” a popular video game it owns, for the first year schools use it. While much of Microsoft’s focus is on software that makes using inexpensive devices — often in the $200 to $300 range — more palatable, the company will also release a $999 device called the Surface Laptop, a twist on its Surface tablets. The device will run Windows 10 S. Tech companies are fiercely competing for business in primary and secondary schools in the United States, a technology market expected to reach $21 billion by 2020, according to estimates from Ibis Capital, a technology investment firm, and EdtechXGlobal, a conference company. Like Microsoft, Apple is not taking the Chromebook phenomenon lying down. Apple recently introduced an iPad management app called Classroom, which enables teachers to assign shared iPads to students and create virtual classrooms to guide students through lessons. Apple also introduced lower pricing for educational institutions on its newest iPad model. The iPad starts at $329 for consumers and at $299 for schools. Google began to take off in schools in the United States in 2013, when school districts started making bulk purchases of Chromebooks, which are now made by Acer, Asus, Lenovo, HP and other computer makers. Because the laptops run on Google’s Chrome operating system and revolve around web-based apps, they are often cheaper, easier to manage and faster to boot up than traditional laptops. Feature-rich By contrast, Gownder of Forrester Research said that Microsoft software is so feature-rich that technology experts in many school districts have had to devote their summers to preparing Windows laptops for students one device at a time. And some of Microsoft’s initial attempts to contend with Google’s rise in schools stumbled. In 2014, Microsoft announced it would be going head-to-head with Chromebooks by working with device manufacturers to introduce cheaper Windows laptops. But some schools found the lower-priced Windows devices too cheaply made to withstand student use and too low-powered to efficiently run Microsoft software. “The cheapest of them would not work,” said Hal Friedlander, a former chief information officer of the New York City Department of Education. Google began to win the classroom software wars as well. In 2014, the company introduced Google Classroom, an app that teachers could use to digitise daily tasks, like assigning homework or taking attendance. It quickly became a hub where teachers could hold class discussions, communicate with individual students and keep parents updated on classroom news. While Microsoft had successfully developed a loyal following among teachers for certain tools — like Skype and its OneNote notebook organiser programme — the company had no answer for the classroom management system, which Google had developed specifically for teachers. “The challenge for Microsoft is that it did not seem to have a coherent strategy,” said Friedlander, who is now chief executive of the Technology for Education Consortium, a nonprofit group that promotes transparent pricing for technology sales to schools.

We like this definition. New cyberattack requesting user permissions to install rogue third-party Google application stopped by IronTraps, IRONSCALES automatic email phishing incident response solution and shared globally across Federation, its global email phishing intelligence network RAANANA, ISRAEL (PRWEB) May 04, 2017 IRONSCALES, the leader in automated email phishing response technologies, today announced that it successfully detected and remediated yesterday’s Gmail and Google Docs phishing attack for its customers across four continents. The complex phishing event, which is projected to have compromised millions of Google apps users worldwide, was reported by several employees of IRONSCALES’ customers in real-time, which triggered IronTraps, its automatic email phishing remediation tool. Once reported, the email was removed from infected mailboxes and attack intelligence was automatically shared with IRONSCALES’ customers via Federation, its global email phishing intelligence network, which prevented the malicious email from affecting other organizations. “Yesterday’s attack is another example of how sophisticated attackers have become with using phishing campaigns to bypass cyber defenses,” said Eyal Benishti, founder and CEO of IRONSCALES. “Organizations are currently spending millions of dollars on cybersecurity solutions that neglect to combat the root cause of breaches – phishing emails. IRONSCALES automated email phishing response technologies are uniquely suited to identify and remediate all types of phishing and email spoofing /impersonation (BEC) attacks before damages can occur.” IRONSCALES customers on four continents spanning the logistics, manufacturing, agriculture, energy, education and satellite services industries, among others, were targeted by yesterday’s phishing attack. In total, several hundred mailboxes were remediated. “Even though this specific attack made waves in the media, IRONSCALES is spotting and responding to similar attacks on a daily basis,” added Benishti. IRONSCALES provides a multi-layered approach to prevent, detect and respond to today’s sophisticated email phishing attacks. By combining human awareness training with automatic incident response, automatic remediation and real-time actionable intelligence sharing, IRONSCALES reduces the time from phishing attack discovery to enterprise-wide remediation from months to seconds, without requiring any SOC team involvement.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You Atul Satija is the quintessential startup man: wants things to move quickly, change to happen fast, results to be delivered as promised, innovation at pace and no shortcuts. All was well and fine in his previous avatar, as the chief business officer at mobile advertising and discovery platform InMobi. For almost two years now, the 40-year-old has been applying the same core principles to the nonprofit world as head of The/Nudge Foundation, a social impact organisation that trains youth on life skills to help them get out of poverty. Nonprofits are all about heart, compassion, hard work and periodic battles for securing funds. Can they scale quicker by adding a layer of corporate culture and cold data tracking, or be run like a startup? The answer probably lies in the way The/Nudge Foundation works. Humble beginnings Satija, whose family had migrated from Pakistan, grew up in Chandigarh. Like any aspiring middle-class student, Satija became an engineer, went to a business school and settled into a career. At one point he was heading the mobile business for Google in the Japan and Asia Pacific region. In December 2010 he joined InMobi, which was a young startup then. “I couldn’t keep focused on my nonprofit with my day job. I thought within six-eight months after things would stabilise, I would get back to developmental work,” said Satija, who had volunteered with NGO End Poverty during his stints at both Google and InMobi. He could not have been more wrong. The work at InMobi was challenging and all-consuming that he stayed for four and half years. He finally started to Nudge full time on July 1, 2015, with the broad theme of alleviating poverty. The purpose statement was to get a million people out of poverty. He reached out to Saurabh Adeeb, whom he knew from his Google days, to start his “market research”. Market research Satija and Adeeb visited slums to understand the ‘customers’. They also looked at content from various providers. According to Adeeb, the idea was to not just give an economic foundation, but go beyond that. “We visited upwards of 100 such settlements — spending time with the community just to speak with people on what they are doing and their aspirations. This gave us a lot of insights,” said Adeeb, who heads corporate and partner engagement at The/Nudge. “Finally, we came down to the model based on interactions with the people.” That model was gurukul. They started a residential programme where youth — both men and women — go through a 100-day Program in Life Management. At the gurukul, they are trained in driving, beautician services, office administration and sales management or plumbing. Other than these core areas, the students will also learn communicative English, numeracy, digital literacy, financial literacy and life foundation, where they are encouraged to take ownership of their lives. Each gurukul is sponsored by a corporate entity. “There was scepticism,” said Adeeb on the initial days. Within two years, the foundation set up eight gurukuls and so far 612 students have graduated from those. “The good thing was, we did not know how NGOs are built. We just knew we had a problem and we knew we have to solve it. It was like any other business. We wanted to solve a problem and we needed ‘customers’,” said Satija. Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani was the first to trust them, and he put in $200,000 in September 2015. “What stood out for me about The/Nudge is the team’s ability to execute and deliver. I am glad that my seed grant has helped them scale to eight gurukuls and to a highly talented team of 75 now, in just one and a half years. Their continuous focus on learning and results is commendable and I look forward to large-scale impact over the next few years,” Nilekani said. Product and data The curriculum at The/Nudge is called ‘the product’. It is not to sound fancy, but to drive home the point that there needs to be continuous improvement. To do that, Satija roped in Anand Sri Ganesh as the head of product management. Ganesh was previously the chief product officer at Manthan, a business intelligence and analytics company. “The (curriculum) design has two primary considerations. We call it product design because it has to be replicable and scalable across different contexts. The first consideration is the student, who missed out on quality education. The second is the employer: what are the needs of the different sectors and the potential opportunities they might have in these sectors. These drive the design of the curriculum,” said Ganesh. The curriculum focuses on practical skills rather than the knowledge part because it is about sustaining a livelihood, without the student falling back into poverty. While the curriculum is focussed on the time that the students spend in the gurukul, another product, ‘life/guard’, helps them in their life after they leave the gurukul. “We need to handhold them for many years … We send the students automated SMS or IVR, with messages like press 1 for subsidised surgery insurance, extra money on weekend, etc. It is a tech product. We have relationship managers,” said Satija. At each of these stages, progress is tracked methodically so as to understand the impact. “Starting from the point of time we meet the student for the first time, the entire journey is captured — the batch, socioeconomic details, cost per admission, conversion by gender and livelihood. We also track different capacities: number of words they can speak English ... (ability to) type in Microsoft Word, Excel. We also track something called a karma point system, which is a personal management system where each student is given a virtual currency in the form of points. Good behaviour is rewarded and if the points reduce to zero, they are expelled,” said Sriram Venkataraman, head of community engagement at The/Nudge. Venkataraman was previously with the Amnesty International India and Frost and Sullivan. While all this might be good for a start, the idea is to keep innovating. The roadmap is set: it is to try personalising the content for different students and measure the impact as practically as possible. N/core project The foundation, meanwhile, is diversifying beyond just imparting life skills to youth. Recently, it started N/Core, an incubator for nonprofit startups, just like in the for-profit world where young startups go to incubation centres to get mentorship and support in their most crucial first few years. The first batch called N/Core Alpha, in partnership with Social Alpha, an initiative supported by the Tata Trusts, attracted 583 applications, out of which 20 were selected. The startups were taken a practitioner-led 14-day immersion programme in Bengaluru where each one of them developed its business plans with support from sectoral and functional experts. “The guidance and mentorship are missing. We want to support the entrepreneur in the early days. The way we think is: six-month multiples depending on the need of the idea. We want to provide grant support, depending on the business plan, just like it happens in the for-profit space. We want to incubate 100 not-for-profits in the next five years,” said Khusboo Maheshwari, head of new initiatives at The/Nudge. “We plan to start from July. Alpha was a two-week programme.” The selected incubatees are working on diverse areas like agritech, healthcare, education, basic needs, skilling and disaster management. During the programme, the incubatees got to pick the brains of Naveen Tewari, CEO, InMobi; G Ananthapadmanabhan, CEO, Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives; Anshu Gupta, founder, Goonj; Venkat Krishnan, founder, GiveIndia; Ajit Rangnekar, ex-dean, Indian School of Business; and others. They worked also with more than 50 design and tech experts during an Impactathon on April 22-23 to design and develop technology solutions for different challenges. “Continuously innovating, being customer centric, having a bias for scale and speed of execution are things that you normally associate with a for-profit company. I am glad to see the same values being very much a part of The/Nudge’s DNA, in their journey to alleviate poverty. To create an ecosystem for smart and committed youngsters to come in and work on India’s social challenges through N/Core is truly disruptive,” said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CEO, Paytm, who is one of the founding patrons of N/Core. For Mekin Maheshwari, the former chief people officer at Flipkart, N/Core is “very dear”. He was deeply involved in designing the programme. “He (Satija) discussed it with me, I was excited. I offered to get more involved. We had a few brainstorming sessions. The overall design and content of the programme, including the tech part and the hackathon — it was very dear to me. I think non-profits will benefit from tech,” Maheshwari said. “This (N/Core) event was powerful: technology folks understanding the challenging work that non-profits do and them understanding the power of tech.” For Gloria Benny, co-founder of Guardians of Dreams, a nonprofit working to provide quality life outcomes to children living in orphanages and shelter homes, the diverse perspectives she got at the N/Core alpha event was very helpful. “The/Nudge leadership team has folks from the for-profit sector and a very high pedigree in terms of experience. There is an influx of high professionalism and the for-profit framework is directly applied — the culture of openness, sharing and feedback,” she added. Future plans The/Nudge Foundation is just a few months away from turning two and is looking at the next big plan: a 100-acre skilling-focussed campus in Sri City, an integrated business township 55 km north of Chennai. “We have received the land. We are setting up one of the world’s largest skilling campuses. Imagine having 7,000-10,000 concurrent students, 30,000 students a year, graduating from a single campus,” said Satija. “This will not just be skilling, it maybe even a teacher skilling academy for skill sector teachers. This will focus on what we are doing — deeper and broader, and create impact beyond the current model. We will have admission centres in different places, where we will talk to potential students and bring them to Sri City. We will see how it evolves.” The organisation is looking at funding from individuals, too. “It is a new thing for us. We need to set up marketing infrastructure. We believe in the use of tech. For example, Zoho has given 50 licences free for CRM,” said Sayi Pavithrasagar, the head of marketing. Ujwal Thaker, who is an adviser to PricewaterhouseCoopers and ex-CEO of Pratham and GiveIndia, believes that The/Nudge’s culture is a reflection of Satija himself. “They are running absolutely like a corporate because the founder comes from that background. Most non-profits are driven by the founder, culture is set by them. He is bringing those processes: be it in marketing, getting new customers, building partnerships... it is driven by the corporate philosophy,” he said. “You are solving for scale ... especially if you want to do it as rapidly as Nudge ... there is evidence that it is working. In substance, it is run like a corporate business with social sector ethos. It is a good thing.” Comments(0)Add Comments How adopting to entrepreneurial approach has helped Atul Satija achieve scale and attract big investors To post this comment you must Log In/Connect with:Indiatimes Network or Fill in your details: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed Share this Comment:Post to Twitter Also Read The/Nudge Foundation turns one year old; helps distressed to study Tata Trusts inks pact with The/Nudge Foundation The/Nudge Foundation partners with Maruti Suzuki Nandan Nilekani commits $200,000 to Nudge Foundation Nudge foundation ties up with Godrej to train aspiring beauticians, impart life skills READ MORE ONThe/Nudge FoundationPayTMNandan NilekaniMicrosoftinMobiInfosysFlipkart Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App.DOWNLOAD NOW FROM AROUND THE WEB Diabetes Type 2 Explained in 25 Slides WebMD The Jeans Girlfriends Are Obsessed With Right Now Chico's Ruggedized Windows 10 Laptops Feature All Day Batteries MicrosoftMORE FROM ECONOMIC TIMES Seven Indian-origin people who made it big on a global scale 6 interesting things about the new UP CM, Yogi Adityanath Ask why Lalu cannot contest elections: PM Modi From Around the WebMore from The Economic Times Earn a Master's Degree at DePaul University College of Computing and Digital Media 9 Worst US States To Retire Due to Taxes, Living Expenses,..

Blog All Research Engineering Product Big Data Global Network Security Graph Community and Partners About Search Back to Umbrella.cisco.com Detecting the Google Docs Phishing Attack Using Traffic Analysis By Brad Antoniewicz and David Rodriguez May 4, 2017 Subscribe The massive phishing attack disguising itself as a Google Docs sharing request is dominating headlines. We’re proud to say that our Sender Rank algorithm detected the attack before the blogs began to roll! Not only that, our unique perspective gives us insight into how successful the attack was. While most reports are looking at the email content itself, our focus is on network traffic, so let’s look there to see the staggering impact of the attack and what Sender Rank looked at to catch it.   Timeframe and Domains Our data shows the attack was mainly concentrated between 2017-05-03 18:00:00 and 2017-05-03 19:00:00, consisting of the following domains that share the lexical attributes doc and cloud among them: gdocs[.]pro gdocs[.]win g-docs[.]pro g-docs[.]win docscloud[.]win docscloud[.]info gdocs[.]download g-cloud[.]pro g-cloud[.]win docscloud[.]download These domains had another common characteristic: a sharp increase in traffic volume. Further, the volume of traffic for these domains happened as most spam does: i.e. early in the morning and typically blasted. Below is an example (g-docs[.]win) of how the domain is dormant, with little or no query volume, prior to its release: Domain volume to g-cloud[.]win domain. The Click The phishing email contains an ‘Open in Docs’ button, which when clicked, sends the user to Google’s OAuth page for authentication and to grant permissions to the victim’s account. In the email we looked at, the URL assigned to the button click contained a redirect parameter, which, once allowed or denied at Google’s OAuth page, would redirect the user to an attacker-controlled website. As identified by our Sender Rank algorithm and confirmed in other articles, the domains listed above were found to be used in this attack, and likely the value of this redirect parameter. Impact The button and the redirect sequence is particularly noteworthy since, in our testing, the user needs to click the ‘Open in Docs’ button, then either click ‘Allow’ or ‘Deny’ on Google’s OAuth page to contact one of these domains. There also were reports of other variants of the phish that just had a link to the attacker-controlled system. Regardless of how many steps it takes for the user to arrive at the attacker-controlled site, the fact that they always need to click something first makes the query volume particularly staggering. For instance, if we just look at four of the ten domains, we see an approximate average of 15,000 queries: Query Volumes   10 domains averaging 15,000 queries might suggest an upwards of 150,000 of our users actually clicked ‘Open in Docs’. Now, it’s hard to say how many users were affected using DNS data alone. Each DNS query does not equate to a single person, compromise, or even system. Nor does a DNS query mean that the system which queried the domain did so as a result of this attack. That being said, even if the actual number was 1/10th of the query count (which, as we’ll show shortly, is more likely the case), it is still staggering to think that many people let their guard down and clicked away. Sender Rank Like all our models, Sender Rank provides visibility into what makes these attacker domains unique. For example, the queries to the attacker-controlled domains were at the same rate as some of the most popular and trusted sites on the internet: apple.com, travelocity.com, and salesforce.com! The following section will break down some of the behavioral attributes that Sender Rank used to detect these attacker domains. Machine Behavior A unique perspective we have in attacks like this is the ability to identify the behavior patterns within the queries made to the domains in the campaign. One interesting question you might ask is, what other malicious domains were being queried during the same time frame as these? In the following charts, we highlight a few aggregated metrics that give insight into the domains used in this attack. First, we can see that there were approximately 1,200 machines querying the three domains at the peak of the attack . This gives us a little more clarity to the impact. The interesting thing here is that machine count was sustained for roughly two hours, then saw a rapid decline in the 3rd hour (a 95% decrease on average). The number of machines querying these domains As we alluded to previously, we can also characterize simultaneous queries over the attack time frame. In other words, we can identify if these attacker domains caused additional queries outside of the norm. In the below chart we report the median number of unique queries made in the same hour (we use the median, rather than mean, due to outliers). The median number of unique queries occurring in the same hour as those made to the attacker controlled domains. We observe about 100 (or so) unique queries were simultaneously made during the time of the attack. This is an interesting comparison to the first chart since here we don’t see a decline in the 3rd hour of the attack. The Email Server Ripple Email servers will often use internet-based block list services when evaluating messages for spam and malicious content. Similar to Sender Rank, email block lists have the ability to aggregate and collate the reactions of a horde of mail servers, giving them a perspective that allows them to recognize large broad campaigns. In the following table, we show the percentage change in the block list volume for the attacker controlled domains . Domain 2017-05-03 18:00:00 2017-05-03 19:00:00 docscloud[.]win 509% 4.7% g-cloud[.]win 537% 1.8% g-docs[.]win 509% -31.4% TABLE 1: Percent change from one hour to the next. To provide additional context, here are a few other domains Sender Rank is tracking (not blocking) with same popularity: bhphotovideo.com googlegroups.com travelocity.com salesforce.com hollisterco.com tumblr.com weebly.com icloud.com blogspot.com office365.com eventbrite.com apple.com Conclusion This attack used a common approach to target users accounts in an unsuspecting way and had a staggering impact. We’ll continue to build systems like Sender Rank to quickly detect the next attacks, protect our customers, and keep you informed!

Voice-controlled gadgets like Amazon Echo and Google Home are all the rage. And now, makers everywhere can construct their own, thanks to Google and the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Google created a kit that lets tinkerers turn a regular Raspberry Pi into a voice-controlled virtual assistant. At this point, the AIY Projects kit isn't available for purchase on its own. You can get it for free when you buy the latest copy of The MagPi — the official Raspberry Pi magazine. Makers can use the kit to "build a cardboard device that uses the Google Assistant SDK to answer questions, like 'how far away is the Moon?' or 'what is 18 percent of 92?" according to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. You can also integrate the kit with your own projects, and create custom commands to summon it to do all sorts of things, like turn on your lights, for instance. Related Raspberry Pi Tops 10M Units Sold Raspberry Pi Tops 10M Units Sold The kit includes a Google Voice Hardware Accessory on Top (HAT) accessory board, a stereo microphone so it can listen to your commands, a large arcade button, some wires, and a cardboard case to put everything in. "All you need to add is a Raspberry Pi 3," according to a blog post from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. "Then, after some software setup, you'll have access to the Google Assistant SDK and Google Cloud Speech API." The kit also works with Raspberry Pi Zero and 2. "The folks at Google, along with us at The MagPi, are really excited to see what projects you can create (or enhance) with this kit, whether you're creating a voice controlled robot or a voice interface that answers all your questions," the Raspberry Pi foundation wrote.

Google Docs phishing attack grants attacker full Gmail access by Michael Heller Senior Reporter A Google Docs phishing attack abused OAuth to give malicious actors full access to a victim's Gmail account and contacts, but Google claims to have blocked the attacks.

It took Google about one hour to acknowledge and reportedly block a Google Docs phishing scheme that was sweeping the web on Wednesday. The Google Docs phishing attacks were first described by user JakeSteam on Reddit. The victim would receive an email that appeared to be a Google Doc that someone shared; following the link would send the user to the Google account selection screen and then a screen asking to grant the malicious "Google Docs" permission to access Gmail messages and contacts. All of this looked like the real Google login process, according to those who received the email, because the third-party app used the Google Drive icon and listed itself under the name "Google Docs," however clicking on the "Google Docs" name that is asking for access permissions reveals the email address of the attacker, not an official Google service. According to JakeSteam, this Google Docs phishing attack bypasses two-factor authentication and spreads by sending itself to everyone in the victim's contact list, including addresses the user had emailed but hadn't fully saved to their contacts. Jaime Blasco, chief scientist for AlienVault, said it looks as if the attack is using a "fake application to abuse OAuth." "Once you give permissions, the attacker will have access to your e-mails. This is similar to what APT28 --the group behind the DNC hack, France election groups attacks --  was using a while back," Blasco told SearchSecurity via email. "I don't believe they are behind this though because this is way too widespread. Many people and organizations have received similar attempts so this is probably something massive and less targeted." Within an hour of the original reddit post about the Google Docs phishing attack, a Googler had replied to JakeSteam saying the issue was being escalated, and was soon updated with an official statement by Google: "We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs and have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail." Mitigating the risk of the Google Docs phishing scheme Mounir Hahad, senior director at Cyphort Labs, was unsure if this would be an effective response by Google. "This is somewhat of a game changer in the sense that there is little to point to as malicious. Any app out there can use Google's API for authentication. For Google to respond to this kind of phishing attack is like a game of whack-a-mole," Hahad told SearchSecurity. "The widespread attacks will be relatively easy to identify and to respond to, but the more targeted ones will fly under the radar for a while." Travis Smith, senior security research engineer at Tripwire, said the Google Docs phishing scheme protections put in place "will most likely prevent this in the future," but attackers will find ways to trick users by spoofing apps in similar ways. Humans will continue to make mistakes when it comes to phishing. Joe Ferrara, president and CEO of Wombat Security Technologies "These may not be as successful in terms of a click-rate as this campaign, but an attacker only needs to be right once to gain a foothold. It's surprising that an attack, which was as successful as this one, did not have a more malicious intent behind it. If the author behind this campaign was truly evil, this would have been a much more serious problem," Smith told SearchSecurity. "Google should do what any security practitioner should do when defending against attacks: think like a hacker. Trying to put on the black hat and think how you would bypass your own protections will help create a more robust application when compared to those who are entirely reactionary." Joe Ferrara, president and CEO of Wombat Security Technologies, noted that educating users is still the best way to combat phishing attacks. "This email appears to come from someone you know and directs you to a Google domain -- highlighting the increased sophistication of phishing attacks and the swift damage they can cause. The best way for organizations to protect themselves is to continually train end users on how to spot suspicious emails and keep them updated on new attack techniques," Ferrara told SearchSecurity. "Humans will continue to make mistakes when it comes to phishing. But it is possible for organizations to increase awareness and educate end users to make better decisions, fewer mistakes and alert the appropriate department about questionable emails so infosec teams can become more proactive."

Photo: Google Maps mail print View all comments Tweet By Andrew Hayward - - Published: 4:00 AM, May 5, 2017 Updated: 9:59 AM, May 5, 2017 SINGAPORE — Who has not used Google Maps to help them get from one place to the next? The fact that it is free also means you do not have to spend money on a GPS unit. Fact is, there are many Google Maps shortcuts that can help you become a true map master. Here are some of them. USE STREET VIEW. Sure, you can see where you are going on the map, but if you want to see what your destination really looks like, you will want to turn to Street View’s 360-degree photo spread, although not every place is covered. On the computer, you can drag the little yellow person icon (“Pegman”) from the bottom of the screen and drop it anywhere on the map. On your mobile, you can drop a pin by holding down anywhere on the map. AVOID ERP GANTRIES. Toll roads can save you time, but if you want to save a couple of dollars, just tap the “…” icon on your phone and hit “Route Options” and “Avoid toll roads” to find a route that will skip any roads with tolls, as well as routes with highways. TIME YOUR JOURNEY. Google Maps can estimate how long it will take to drive somewhere, but it can also help you plan for traffic situations too. On your computer, enter a destination and see the routes, then click “Leave now” and navigate to “Depart at” instead. Enter when you want to leave, and Maps will give you an estimate for that timeframe. Alternatively, pick “Arrive by” to figure out when you should leave home. ADD EXTRA STOPS. Getting from point A to point B is great, but if you are on the road and decide you need to fuel up on petrol, you do not have to bail out on your navigation mid-trip. Just add in extra destinations by tapping the little vertical ellipsis on the upper right section, and then hit “Add stop”. You will get options for places to stop without leaving your ideal route. SEND THE INFORMATION. If you sorted out directions on your computer before running to the car, you do not need to start over from scratch on your mobile device or car display. Simply sign into the same account on your mobile device, and then from your computer, click “Send to your phone” on a place listing, or “Send directions to your phone” when picking a route for navigation. SHARE YOUR INFORMATION. One of Google Maps’ latest tricks is the ability to share your real-time location with any other Google user. You can share where you are at any given time. Just open up the side menu and pick “Share location”. If you are in navigation mode, tap the “…” button and choose “Share trip”.   A version of this story first appeared on Stuff Singapore.  mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Lifestyle READ COMMENTED “I love having camera phones” “Forgive my honesty, but is there a local fashion or modelling scene in Singapore today?” ’Twas the night before Christmas ’Genderless’ androgynous fashion on Tokyo runway bang on trend ‘X’ marks the sport Yes, there is a right way to wash your hair World’s oldest gymnast, 92, performs during International Ageing Week in Singapore Why is beer yoga a thing?

Now that Android Wear is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table comparing every watch. You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device. The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However, the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch snfaces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395. The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform. Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bābā ghanūj Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging.

The country’s revenue agency, Agenzia delle Entrate, said in a statement: “The settlement with Google’s Italian and Irish subsidiaries covers the 2002 to 2006 and 2009 to 2015 periods. “It also puts an end to investigations conducted by Milan prosecutors.” The tax agency said Google also agreed to sign an agreement ensuring “the future correct taxation in Italy” of company activities related to the country. An Agenzia delle Entrate spokesman told newsmen that the settlement was a model for other EU countries. The statement said: “Google and the Italian Revenue Agency have reached a settlement, resolving a tax inquiry for a period between 2002 and 2015 without litigation. “We remain committed to Italy and will continue to help grow the online ecosystem.” In December 2015, Italy struck a similar agreement with Apple, which agreed to pay 318 million Euros to tax authorities to settle a tax evasion case investigated by Milan prosecutors worth 880 million Euros during the 2008 to 2013 period. Several multinationals have come under scrutiny in the EU for the tax minimisation practice of declaring profits in countries with low corporate taxes, like Ireland or Luxembourg, even if they are made elsewhere in the bloc. dpa/NAN.

Logging your business details enables Google to better index the relevant information, and present it in related search results, which can have significant benefits. And now Google could be close to making this process even easier, requiring less input from business owners. According to a new report on the Google Research blog, they’re working on a new system that’s able to recognize business names and addresses via Google Street View images, which are constantly updated to ensure they reflect the latest info. As per the report, Google has developed a new process which is able to identify the text on street signs from ‘very challenging’ Street View images. According to Google, their algorithm now achieves “84.2% accuracy on the challenging French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art systems” – results which are good enough for them to release the model for wider use. But while the focus is on street signs, and how they can help Google ensure the accuracy of their Maps listings, consistent with real-world experiences, the other key element is businesses. As noted by Google: “Importantly, our system is easily extensible to extract other types of information out of Street View images as well, and now helps us automatically extract business names from store fronts.” The system is still in development, but Google explains that in their work on the process (which has been in development for the last few years), they’ve been able to overcome various challenges in object recognition to improve the accuracy of their listings, including the translation of relevant data from storefront signs. “Once a storefront is detected, one still needs to accurately extract its name for it to be useful - the model must figure out which text is the business name, and which text is not relevant. We call this extracting “structured text” information out of imagery. It is not just text, it is text with semantic meaning attached to it.”  In this image, Google says their system was able to accurately identify the business name ‘Zelina Pneus’ despite the accompanying tire brand signage that could confuse the model. In future, Google says that this system will be able to accurately 'read' business names, enabling them to cross-check that info with their existing system data to provide more accurate and up-to-date business listings. It’s another example of how machine learning and big data are changing the discovery process, and simplifying on and offline connection. Google’s Street View cars collect millions of images every day, building upon Google’s data resource of more than 80 billion high resolution images. Of course, analyzing data at that scale requires a lot of computing power, but Google's moving closer to making this a reality. There may come a time where Google has most of the data it needs on your store front before you even enter it, helping them to improve the accuracy of their knowledge graph, geographic targeting, ad delivery, etc. Really, we’re only just now beginning to touch upon the possibilities of such technology – it’ll be interesting to see how such data and insight can be used in future to improve the user experience.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

This legislation, it turned out, was a cash cow for Congress. Large telecommunication companies wanted to prevent Markey’s protections from being put in place, since it would constrain their business. Companies like Google and Netflix, on the other hand, wanted to make sure the protections were put in place, since they would protect their business. Without net neutrality protections, the telecommunication companies could regulate how quickly sites like Google and Netflix loaded for their customers — or whether their customers were able to access the sites at all. A new report from the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, uses the battle that unfolded over this 2006 legislation to illustrate a larger point: That with enough money, companies can buy legislators’ votes. In this example, of course, party played a big role in how members of Congress voted: Democrats largely supported net neutrality, Republicans largely didn’t. The partisan split remains today. But money also played a determining role, the Roosevelt Institute’s researchers found. For every $1,000 given by a company like Netflix or Google, the likelihood that a member of Congress would vote for the legislation increased by 24 percent. For every $1,000 given by companies that opposed net neutrality, the chances that a legislator would vote against the legislation increased by 2.6 percent. The amendment failed, though President Barack Obama’s Federal Communications Commission later secured net neutrality without Congress’ help. (It is, however, now under threat again by President Donald Trump’s FCC chair.) The Roosevelt Institute study that came up with this cost-per-vote analysis is one of a kind. It’s very hard to track influence, and it only got more difficult to do so after 2010, when new species of nonprofit began to populate the political spending ecosystem in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. Interconnected super PACs, LLCs, party-affiliated groups, think tanks and dark money nonprofits allowed donors to pass limitless and often anonymous sums through a financial labyrinth, making it near-impossible, in some cases, for journalists and citizens to track which special interest was influencing which vote. But, in the new study, political scientists Thomas Ferguson and Paul Jorgensen and statistician Jie Chen have done the work to document how money influences Congress. The authors of this study attempted to take all of the post-Citizens United groups into account — candidate campaign committees, party committees, dark money groups, SuperPACs and others. In addition to the 2006 vote on net neutrality, the researchers examined how members of Congress voted on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which passed Congress in 2010 and were meant to rein in some of the Wall Street excesses that contributed to the financial crisis. The Democratic Party largely supported Dodd-Frank — some of its strictest provisions were the handiwork of progressive senators like Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH). But the researchers found that for every $100,000 a House Democrats received from the financial industry, the odds that the legislator in question would break with the party and oppose an aspect of Dodd-Frank increased by 13.9 percent. The researchers also found that the temptation of a spin through the revolving door may have played a role in how members of Congress voted on Dodd-Frank. Legislators who left the House in 2014 were much more likely to side with the banks in their votes, because, the researchers suggest, they were considering where their future paychecks might come from. “Taken as a whole, the pattern [the two case studies] display is too obvious to need much emphasis,” the researchers write. “Substantial numbers of legislators sell out the public interest in exchange for political money.” Political money also ensures that the politicians favored by corporations have the money they need to campaign hard for reelection and hold onto their office, the researchers write. That may mean that those who retain their seats are more friendly to well-healed interests. Because of the amount of money they have, and their willingness to spend it on political issues that could affect their bottom line, the telecommunications industry and the financial industry are two of the most influential constituencies in Washington — a fact demonstrated by the never-ending battles over financial regulation and net neutrality, both of which have lobbyists gearing up, once again, in an effort to push a new bushel of corporate favors through Congress and onto Trump’s desk in 2017. _______ About author John Light is a reporter and digital producer for the Bill Moyers team.

Features ● Verbal commands for Siri ● AirPlay ● Seven tweeters, one woofer ● Custom ARM processor ● Probably     ● Maybe     ● Probably not Apple is working on its own competitor to the Amazon Echo, according to a number of rumors, with the creation of an audio device that will allow users to make Siri queries without directly interacting with any other Apple devices.  The proposed device would in theory compete directly against the aforementioned Echo, as well as Google Home, hardware Apple is likely to emulate with its own offering. In theory, this would provide more opportunities for Apple customers to interact with the assistant, rather than use competing systems, keeping users within the Apple ecosystem.  Some reports have gone against the rumors, suggesting Apple won't produce an Echo-like speaker, with Apple supposedly looking to make Siri an "omnipresent AI assistant across devices" instead of a central hub.  Current speculation has Apple introducing the device at WWDC on June 5, alongside potential updates to Siri that will arrive on iPhones and other hardware in the future. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes there to be a more than 50 percent chance of a WWDC announcement for the device.  Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker Physical Design Based on the Google and Amazon competition, it is likely the proposed device would take the form of a network-connected speaker with a microphone array. The nearest product to the proposed device currently offered by Apple is the Beats Pill range of speakers. While not an Apple-branded product, it is plausible for Apple to borrow aspects of Beats' designs for its own intelligent speaker.  While it is unclear if it will be a portable device, like some items from Beats' speaker range, it is likely to be built as a staticly-located speaker. Due to its presumably audio-heavy interface, managing network connectivity while on the move could be considered a challenge for a portable version.  A leak from Sonny Dickson in late April claims Apple is "currently finalizing" designs for the speaker, which is "expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device." The hardware could use some form of Beats technology, Dickson claims, and will run a variant of iOS.  As for the appearance, Dickson suggests it will have a concave top that will house physical controls, a similar button positioning to the Echo range.Boasting "Mac Pro style," it is claimed it will also have a speaker mesh portion covering the body of the device, similar to the UE Boom Bluetooth speaker sold in Apple retail stores.  Dickson has been accurate in the past for some predictions such as the revamped lockscreen interface in iOS 10.  On May 1, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo issued a note to investors speculating that the device will use one woofer and seven tweeters for a rich sound. Inside will be a custom ARM processor similar in power to the A8 CPU, used in the iPhone 6.  Apple's custom W1 chip, which handles the Bluetooth connectivity in the company's AirPods, will allow other wireless accessories to connect to the Siri device automatically, so long as they are logged into the same iCloud account. Continuing on media playback, Kuo also believes that support for AirPlay in the device for music streaming will help Apple quickly gain a footing in the market, capitalizing on the extensive music services available to its users.  Siri A core component to the device will be Siri. Much like Alexa on Amazon's Echo device range, the device should allow for users to invoke Siri by verbal commands alone, and to receive a spoken response.  It is believed that Apple will be introducing a number of new features to Siri at WWDC, claimed DigiTimes in January, though the report stopped short of stating what features to expect.  Due to the high reliance on verbal communication, any changes to Siri will make a major impact on the device's chances of being a success at launch.  Siri has been criticised in the past for providing relatively limited functionality compared to its main competition, especially when considering contextual queries. For example, Google Assistant, the latest iteration of Google's own tool, is capable of understanding follow-up questions, like "Who is the U.S. President?" followed by "How old is he?" Samsung has also made an effort to join the digital assistant market, with its own Bixby assistant included in the Galaxy S8. Bixby is thought to be based on technology by Viv Labs, a firm created by former Apple employees and Siri co-founders Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Chris Bringham, and acquired by Samsung in October 2016.  Viv's biggest technological advantage over Siri was its third-party integration, which effectively allowed the user to easily perform transactions or use third-party services with verbal commands.  Apple has not rested on its laurels with Siri, investing in its own machine learning work as well as acquiring firms in the AI and language processing fields, such as Perceptio, VocalIQ, and Turi. Any work from these investments are likely to make a big impact to the way Siri operates, improving the assistant across the Apple ecosystem of hardware.  The higher level of competition in the digital assistant field is likely to drive Apple to make Siri the best assistant the company can. While this will generally focus on improving the experience for iOS users, especially for the "iPhone 8" this fall, it is highly likely any progress made there will also benefit Siri on the speaker.    Name So far, none of the rumors or leaks have suggested a name for the supposed device, though it is apparently known internally by the codename "B238." Despite being the main way of interacting with the speaker, it is unlikely that Apple will employ "Siri" in the name. Since Siri is its own multi-platform service, Apple will probably try to keep the branding of the new hardware different, if only to separate the two brands.    Amazon's lineup of Alexa-enabled devices Pricing and Availability KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in April the specifications of the proposed device will push the price higher than the Amazon equivalent. It will apparently be positioned for the high-end market, with a better entertainment experience and superior sound quality qualifying the potentially increased cost compared to its rivals.  For reference, Amazon sells the Echo for $180 and the Echo Dot for $50. The Google Home costs $129.  Kuo also believes Apple could ship as many as 12 million units of the device over the first year of availability. If it proves to be popular, Kuo suggests Apple could sell extended models of the device, echoing the Echo lineup from Amazon.    Production by Inventec A report from the Economic Daily News on May 3 claims Inventec has been selected by Apple to produce the rumored speaker. Supply chain reports from the Chinese publication claim Inventec is involved, but it is unclear if the Taiwanese firm is being used for component production or device assembly.  Inventec has a history with Apple, working for the Cupertino iPhone producer since the iPod. The firm is also currently producing another Apple audio product, with its facilities used to manufacture AirPods.  If the report is true, this means that Apple's primary assembler, Foxconn, hasn't been selected to build the device. Foxconn is already the producer of one of the supposed device's competitors, the Amazon Echo.    Essential Reading Inventec allegedly tapped for Apple's rumored standalone Siri speaker product Apple's Siri-based Echo competitor to carry premium price, feature high-end audio with 1 woofer & 7 tweeters Apple's Siri-based Echo competitor rumored to borrow design cues from Mac Pro, could arrive at WWDC Apple 'finalizing' design of Amazon Echo rival based on Siri Better incarnation of Siri may appear alongside Apple's 2017 iPhones - report Apple unlikely to develop an Echo-like standalone Siri speaker - report     Siri Home Speaker Stories (276) Inventec allegedly tapped for Apple's rumored standalone Siri speaker product ~2 days ago Apple's Siri-based Echo competitor to carry premium price, feature hig... ~4 days ago Apple's Siri-based Echo competitor rumored to borrow design cues from ... ~7 days ago Apple 'finalizing' design of Amazon Echo rival based on Siri ~8 days ago Amazon Echo Look and iOS app judges your wardrobe choices with machine learning ~9 days ago Apple AI guru Tom Gruber speaks of artificial intelligence's 'inevitab... ~9 days ago Actress says credit for Siri's personality belongs to Apple programmer... ~21 days ago Amazon allowing Alexa software, far-field microphone technology use by... ~21 days ago Koogeek Smart Plug converts regular light socket into Apple HomeKit light ~30 days ago Rumor: Siri to get iMessage integration, adapt to user habits in 'iOS 11' ~1 month ago 4-year-old saves mother's life by asking Apple's Siri to call emergenc... ~1 month ago Marriott likely to decide on Apple Siri or Amazon Alexa for hotels lat... ~1 month ago Siri competitor Alexa comes to iPhone via Amazon's official app ~2 months ago Apple exposes how it teaches new languages to Siri, staying ahead of c... ~2 months ago RBC iOS app update adds pay-by-voice commands to Apple's Siri ~2 months ago Server firmware security incident in 2016 forced Apple to sever ties w... ~2 months ago Apple confirms existence of Cambridge Siri R&D lab with new office sign ~2 months ago Apple unlikely to develop an Echo-like standalone Siri speaker - report ~2 months ago Apple's Siri gets 'LEGO Batman Movie' tie-in with custom Bat-phrases ~3 months ago Quickly adjust AirPods volume by percentage and check listening levels... ~3 months ago Must-know Siri commands for Apple's wireless AirPods ~3 months ago Apple updates Siri on iOS, Mac & Apple TV with Super Bowl-related commands ~3 months ago Apple's 'differential privacy' policy invoked for opt-in iCloud data a... ~3 months ago Apple officially named as founding member of Partnership for AI, Siri ... ~3 months ago Apple reportedly close to joining Partnership on AI industry group to ... ~3 months ago Better incarnation of Siri may appear alongside Apple's 2017 iPhones - report ~3 months ago The best third-party apps for iOS 10 that support Apple's Siri ~4 months ago How to turn on Siri for third-party apps in iOS 10 ~4 months ago Adobe concept demonstrates editing images on iPad using just your voice ~4 months ago Is Apple getting Siri-ous in the face of Amazon's Alexa Echo? ~4 months ago Test link Top of page Copyright © 2017, Quiller Media, Inc., Contact Us Privacy Policy Advertise on AppleInsider Design: gesamtbild

USA TODAY LOS ANGELES - It's World Password Day, a marketing gimmick dreamed up by chipmaker Intel and supported by many organizations, including Amazon and Dell, designed to get you to beef up your online security. Don't let the hype get in the way of a good message — hackers have never been busier — as witnessed by the big Google Docs hack attempt this week. So today is as good as any to stop, take a minute and update your online security. Emmanuel Schalit, the founder of password manager Dashlane  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) The most common password used, even to this day, is "password" and 123456. Security experts recommend a strong mix of letters, numbers and symbols, preferably ones that make no sense, says Emmanual Schalit, the founder of Dashlane, a popular password manager, which automatically generates tough ones. (Dashlane is free on one device, or $39.99 yearly on multiple devices.) Having the same password on multiple sites is like "giving the keys to your home to everyone who delivers a package," he says. "If you share the same password to multiple sites, when one becomes breached, the hacker will use the same password to all your websites." Schalit joined us on the #TalkingTech podcast to talk all things passwords, and how in a perfect world, he'd like to see them changed every five minutes or so. (Relax — he actually changes his every three months, using an automated feature of the Dashlane app to create hard to crack passwords.) Password managers remember your passwords so you won't have to — you sign in with one master password, which you have to remember. The apps don't store it for you, they say, to keep them away from hackers. A big question many folks have about password managers like Dashlane, Lastpass, Zoho Vault and others. What if the hacker gets to your master password? The managers send out e-mails when you log in from a new device requesting authentication, and the hacker would have to know both your e-mail and master password. It's for situations like this why Schalit recommends two-factor authentication on all your accounts. This requires you to sign in with your password, and then sign in again, usually with a code sent via text message. This makes it harder for hackers to get to you — so they move onto to the easier targets. Schalit admits that few people use two-factor. "It's in the low single digits because it's too complicated for people," he says. "One thing you'll see change in the next two years, you'll see a move to make two factor more accessible to people." He doesn't like getting two-factor texts, because texts are easy to hack — he prefers using an app, like Google's Authenticator or Authy. Click the link below to listen to our interview.

[Is This Real?] Google Calendar's web interface should be getting a redesign in Q4 2017 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 5:33am PDTMay 4, 2017 56 Plus 1 on G+ 85 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares199 Google News Videos Folks, it's happening. Alright, it's not happening right now, but it should be happening soon. What every Google Calendar user has wanted for years, what every Google user who dared venture in the dark and murky waters of calendar.google.com has clamored for, what every piece of common sense has predicted: Google Calendar's web interface is getting a revamp. According to this roadmap of G Suite features that has appeared in a presentation from Google's Cloud NEXT 2017 event, Google Calendar has a "redesign of web interface" planned for Q4 2017. If that is what it exactly says it should be, then we will finally have that brand spanking new Calendar UI on the web that we've been dreaming of and that we can only achieve with themes and extensions right now. Below, you will find the entire slide of G Suite's usability features roadmap — check it out to see if there's something else planned that is interesting. I've also linked to the exact moment it shows up in the video of the "G Suite Product Roadmap — 2017 and beyond" presentation. (The video is from the EMEA satellite event with Dennis DeMeyere presenting, but it should be the same presentation as the one in San Francisco.) Nothing in here says "Material Design" or "new and shiny and colorful and clean and modern," so we can't jump to conclusions just yet. But at least we have hope that at some point in Q4 2017, Google Calendar on the web will look less like the lost bastard child of a 2013 one-night stand.

Maybe they'll introduce a new Gmail Messenger while they're at it... F4LL0U7 (I do realize this is most likely adding the ability to create reminders for certain emails that you don't want to fall off your radar, which I fully support!) catalysto This is exactly what Inbox is designed for. F4LL0U7 Right, but some of us just can't get into the Inbox interface, and would still like reminders on our emails. Cesar Cardoso "Gmail - create reminders. Yes, please!" And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE integrate with all the 70000 reminders on Google products. Even if it's more like "star on steriods", as F4LL0U7 speculates. The Swami i'd settle for something simple, like an actual usable recurring Tasks setup, instead of having to go out for other apps to integrate that functionality into Google Calendar (reminders are worthless to me for this). Unfortunately, Google puts in what Google wants, not what the customer wants. Geoff Johnson Since they love splitting one service into many, I wouldn't be surprised to see features stripped from Calendar and put into a separate app. Mark Curtis Another chat app. Midas Gordon-Farleigh With a bot that you can talk to to create an event. Leo Herzog Did you watch the video? That's literally a feature of their new Hangouts Chat product. Midas Gordon-Farleigh No, I didn't. Unfortunately, not being a GSuite user, I figured there probably wasn't much worth my time in that. That's a bit silly though. Sigh. Defenestratus I don't use calendar for work - but for my personal life it seems to work pretty well. Not sure what it is that people want out of a redesign. Sean Thomas that's the same for me but I only use the android app which is material already. if you go to the calendar website on desktop it's just kind of outdated compared to the app interface. Defenestratus Yeah I guess I can see that. I don't think the design ever really got in the way of my using the product though. The "Create Event" screen on the other hand... it needs some help. Suicide_Note My thoughts exactly. Dawid Kania Hi Rita! I can confirm that this redesign exists. What's even more interesting since yesterday I have access to it.

Josh Flowers He said https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/72eaa756ce425ac019d0637e35838dcd5846e8e660c771d22950b13701f6eee4.jpg Nicholas Conrad I don't want a candy-coated calendar. Material design really does nothing for me, reminds me of: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/68423836fc3bc7576ed6e12686edeaa2f4b35db5c9c05a508d014f98b01e0b32.jpg Marcellus1 Disappointed the roadmap doesn't include more on Docs. It didn't have enough features I need to switch from Word. Leo Herzog The only thing left for me is custom fonts. What else are you missing? Kevfromspace A Show ruler setting would be great Marcellus1 I need a lot more formatting options. Trevor Kinsie I really hope that the redesign changes nothing about the functionality. I love Google Calendars as it is, I know it's not the purdiest thing, but that really doesn't matter to me. Please google just give it a nice coat of paint and be done, if you can add features great! Just don't take anything away. Rita El Khoury I love most of Calendar as it is, but for goodness sake, make it easier to set up notifications when someone adds an event to a shared calendar. Right now, users have to manually (and in a not-so-clear way or place) turn on email notifications for shared calendar changes, and that's it. Emails... In 2017. Miles∙Prower I know folks who love Google Calendar for what it is. Me? I'm old enough to have spent years on Palm, then on Pocket PC and Windows Mobile -- with integrations to Office desktop. When I switched over to Android and Google Apps almost a decade ago, I was surprised at the utter shittiness of the user experience in Google's productivity tools. Since then, Android's versions of these tools has improved immensely, while Google's web-based tools have remained as shitty as day 1. And Calendar is by far the worst of them. Come on, it's 2017, and you still have to navigate to a whole new web page that displays an entry form, just to see the details/notes for an appointment? Alex I'd like to see improved support for the quick entry feature on the web. In the app, it will autocomplete locations after you type "at", assigning the full address to the location field of the event. This doesn't happen on the web, at the moment. I usually end up going in to the app to manually set the location, as it works better. mondeca Congrats on finally doing things that needed doing a long time ago? James Donut Anyone uses here gmail as a journal (past dates) rather than scheduler (future)??? Daniel It's about time! The web app looks like a website from a decade ago... 4Ui812 This one's for you Rita 😁 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6e83fc9381904fe522d202244f0a29e30b87f3a4fe62d22351427aaaa3618cf6.jpg jwildman16 I've driven by there many times! Indian Hills, CO. bazsi44 A little bit of self ad maybe, but I waited too long for this, so I made a Material Redesign myself. :) You will need Stylish and Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey to use it though. http://balazsorban.com/google-calendar-web-material/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad239a2458b5009c1fa2637ba8d59dc2142593b759733b221e384075cf2fbd8e.png It may have some flows, as I updated it a long time ago. But It is still nicer than that we have now. aRvInD While design overhaul is needed, Mobile Calendar app while I daily use Only sync events/reminders only for past year! Why Google? We are using smartphone with GBs of storage these days. Giving the user with option to sync how history events need to be synced should be made..! Even now when storage is full to remaining 0%, it shows no space to save a small single SMS! Can't SMS memory reserve an MB space prior? Gonzales You'd think that Google loving the cloud there'd be plenty of room. I'm hoping this design carries over to the mobile app. I use that daily. Carson Saldanha Ink for Google's pretty good Anjo Cerdeña 👆 This, but I'm very biased. Diggle Link please? Carson Saldanha Just search for it in the Chrome Web Store Carson Saldanha It's an extension Ger PG Not really thrilled about this considering how the Contacts interface was "improved" some time ago... Winston Oh goody another way to add reminders is coming. Winston This will give me even more choices when adding a reminder, and cover so many use cases. Not confusing at all! /s EcE OMG!!!!!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19c21de580767556b5152df546358399957f9b59b55dafd30cff4d3a2553ab38.gif Nope.jpeg This might have to do for now. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clean-google-calendar/magodclodecbbnbdfpmoehfdddkhlfmm Diego S. It seems to be the end of the world!! I use Ink for Google Services Chrome Extension Butterpillar They better add flairs like in mobile apps, otherwise I won't use it. Rita El Khoury Meta: What would happen if during the revamp, calendar.google.com went down and Google forgot it had scheduled a Calendar revamp on its own calendar? wicketr What if their "revamp" is to replace it like Allo replaced Hangouts missing tons of features for an entire year. Like it requires a new account type, and doesn't integrate with your existing gmail account /friends, and missing ability to create events, and lacks any synchronization to the cloud and your mobile device since all data is stored in a cookie on that specific PC. Rita El Khoury Funny, but if we're being serious, Google might mess with a lot of things, but Calendar isn't one of them. Part of the reason they haven't updated the UI until now, I think. JG But don't worry... At least we'll be able to add stickers and animated emoji to our calendar events... That's far more important than silly things like being able to access it from something other than just a single device. Berni Hargrove So the real story here is why doesn't Google publicly release product roadmaps for their other products. Mathew Michel Please Google, upgrade the design this time. It's been too long. HSidhu Reminders are coming to Gmail, now I know which one to choose from (Inbox or Gmail) :) Tks Rita mike shwilly Q4 2018 - Calendar redesign moves from G-Suite to public Cesar Cardoso "Calendar - discoverability of secondary calendars" About time, Google, about time! Urmil Shroff I cannot even believe. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Then please they should add more options for Repeat, like "Every last Friday of the Month" or "Every First Monday of the Month". PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. sky417 Still no love for Google Finance? Leo Herzog What, you don't like Flash charts? Curt inb4 bricks all Nexus and Pixel devices when accessed via one of them.

WIRED If you get a Google Doc link in your inbox today, scrutinize it carefully before you click — even if it looks like it comes from someone you trust. A nasty phishing scam that impersonates a Google Docs request has swept the internet today, including a decent chunk of media companies. You’ve heard “think before you click” a million times, but it really could save you from a whole lot of hassle. Google has taken steps to neutralize this particular phish. The company said in a statement that it has “disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” But when it comes to phishing defense there’s always an element of cat and mouse. Large-scale phishing attacks and those impersonating popular services like Google log-in pages regularly stalk the internet. RELATED: Sneaky Exploit Allows Phishing Attacks From Sites That Look Secure “The importance of this phish is not how it spread, but rather how it didn’t use malware or fake websites tricking users to give up their passwords,” says Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at the phishing research and defense company PhishMe, which analyzed data from the fake Google Docs campaign. “This phish worked because it tricked the user into granting permissions to a third-party application. This is the future of phishing, and every security technology vendor is ill-equipped to deal with it.” Similar Google Docs scams in particular have been circulating since at least 2014, but that doesn’t make them any easier to spot, in part because they seem so authentic. Phishers can use real Google accounts and develop third-party plugins that can interact with Google services, so they can lure victims in through the most perfect-looking Google web pages of all: Genuine ones. And variations on this approach hit over and over, much like waves in the ocean. Fishing? Phishing. You get it. Here’s how to stay vigilant this time, and going forward. Trust Fall This round of Google docs phishing emails works like so: You get an email saying someone added you to a Google Doc; click this link to view it. That takes you to a legitimate account screen, listing all the Google accounts you’re logged into. From there, you choose the one you want to use to view the document (or log in, if you weren’t already authenticated in your browser). There, a malicious service called “Google Docs” awaits, asking for privileges to access your account, your contacts, your password rests, your emails, everything. If you already clicked this type of link today (or any day), go to the Permissions page of your Google account as quickly as possible and, in this case, revoke access to the service called “Google Docs.” Again, it’s a fake. Then change your password and make sure you have two-factor authentication turned on, which you totally already did, right? Safety First To help protect yourself even further in the future, Google offers a tool called Password Alert that warns you if you type your Google account credentials into any page that isn’t officially Google’s. If phishers have made a realistic-looking fake, Password Alert instantly suggests that you change your password and secure your account as soon as you’ve made the mistake. But this doesn’t necessarily protect you when scammers are manipulating genuine Google processes. And, of course, it doesn’t help you identify fake log-in pages related to other companies’ services. READ MORE: Phishing Scams Even Fool Tech Nerds—Here’s How to Avoid Them Resisting the urge to click remains the best first line of defense out there. When you can spot inconsistencies or suspicious content in an email that may help tip you off — in this case, a “To:” field populated by “hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh” should raise suspicions — and listening to those instincts is important. But in the case where a phishing email (or a spear phishing email tailored to you) is perfect enough to convince you, it takes a general habit of thinking before you click to give you a chance. Downloading attachments or clicking links shouldn’t be automatic even when they seem to be from the people closest to you. Downloading attachments or clicking links shouldn’t be automatic even when they seem to be from the people closest to you. Particularly if you’re not expecting a message, you should take a moment to examine any URLs it contains in a plaintext editor, or double-check with your friend through another means of communication that they really sent you a Word document of recipes. These quick checks can make a big difference. Sometimes a second look is all it takes to realize that your coworker probably wouldn’t send a Google Doc to your entire company out of the blue.

According to online reports - in particular, a detailed user thread on Reddit - clicking on an emailed share link, purportedly from a known source, was taking users to a site that asked permission for a fake app calling itself "Google Docs" to access their accounts. If they agreed, the app would then send additional copies of the original email to the users' contacts. Earlier reports suggested the attack was a phishing scam potentially aimed at harvesting personal information and maybe even Google login credentials. © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Kodi boxes ARE illegal if sold 'fully-loaded' claims European court But in a statement, Google said that while the campaign accessed and used contact information, no other data was apparently exposed. Google said it was able to stop the campaign in about an hour. It has disabled offending accounts, removed fake pages and updated its Safe Browsing feature, which issues warnings when users visit dangerous sites. Meet the brand new Birmingham Mail app - free on iOS and Android Users do not have to take additional action, although Google encouraged those who want to be extra safe to run its security check feature. One telltale sign for identifying the spam email is that it appears to be directed to the address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com and is only blind copied to the recipient.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going — we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully be fixed before the KEYone is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55μm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design, the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used — I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish feels like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone — I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like — I just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see it every time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you — I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player — rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations — Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there — I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot quite hold its own next to the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing. Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades — you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84° wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up — this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone.   Nipping at the heels of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you.   DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or you can have it inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know when something accesses my calendar or to notify me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this — I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look — you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup.    The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options — I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything.   If you're super paranoid about people peering over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher — all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone — not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything with a production model when the phone is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even though it is a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting — honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it (I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do. It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me — I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason.

Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...😉 Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It´s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu?

The AIY Projects kit comes free with issue 57 of The MagPi, which is hitting news shelves across the UK from today, and arriving with subscribers from tomorrow. All you’ll need is the Raspberry Pi 3, along with the hardware kit and directions supplied inside the special edition of the magazine. In a post on the Raspberry Pi blog, features editor Rob Zwetsloot explains: “Inside the magazine, you’ll find a Google Voice Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) accessory board, a stereo microphone Voice HAT board, a large arcade button, and a selection of wires. Last but not least, you’ll find a custom cardboard case to house it all in. “All you need to add is a Raspberry Pi 3. Then, after some software setup, you’ll have access to the Google Assistant SDK and Google Cloud Speech API.” Related: Best Raspberry Pi projects There’s also a video explaining how it's done, which you can see below: The hardware kit doesn’t limit makers to building a Home clone; it can also be used to create a voice-controlled robot, for example. Both Google and the Pi foundation are hoping makers will take the initiative and post projects under the hashtag #AIYProjects. These special editions of The MagPi tend to fly out, so make sure you pick one up from WH Smith, ASDA, Sainsbury's, Tesco or any good newsagent. Our US readers can grab it at Barnes & Noble.

Google is making it easier for Android users to detect phishing scams in Gmail. Now, instead of having to rely solely on your spidey senses, Gmail tell you when something's awry. If you click on a suspicious link in an email, Gmail will display a warning message before you're redirected to a potentially malicious site. "Warning – phishing (web forgery) suspected," the message will read.

Related Your Email Is Never Going to Be Safe Your Email Is Never Going to Be Safe The new feature is rolling out to all Android users over the next few days. This comes after online miscreants yesterday launched a large phishing attack targeting Google accounts. The fraudulent emails included what appeared to be a Google Docs link from someone the recipient knew. Clicking that link took users to a Google page that asked them to grant access to an app masquerading as Google Docs. Granting permission reportedly gave the attacker full access to a victim's email messages and contacts. Google said it shut down the attack, which affected "fewer than 0.1 percent" of Gmail users, within an hour. Meanwhile, attackers in January targeted Gmail users with a sophisticated ploy designed to steal usernames and passwords.

The settlement ends one of several probes into Google's tax arrangements in the European Union, as governments maintain the pressure on other U.S. giants they accuse of tax evasion. The tax probes come as Brussels and national capitals crack down on what they view as corporate tax abuse, both by pushing to change international tax rules and by investigating companies that have struck deals with low-tax jurisdictions to slash their tax bill. Thursday's agreement between Google and Italy relates mainly to corporate taxes the Italians say Google failed to pay between 2009 and 2015. Rome alleges Google routed more than EUR1 billion in Italy-based revenue to its office in Ireland, where tax rates are far lower. A company spokesman said that of the EUR306 million in back taxes, EUR303 million was attributed to Google Italy, with the rest to Google Ireland. As part of the deal, Google will agree to pay taxes on future income -- largely related to advertising sales -- generated in Italy, according to Italian tax authorities. Google has long argued that clients in countries such as Italy don't actually close any advertising deals with employees in these countries, but instead buy the spots from Google Ireland, the company's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, a person familiar with the company's thinking said Google preferred to settle with Rome to bring to a close a controversy that has cast a negative light on the company in Italy. The Italian probe is just one of a number of judicial problems facing Google in Europe, where it has also faced scrutiny from national tax authorities in France and the U.K. The company also remains entangled in three separate antitrust investigations led by the European Commission, the bloc's top competition watchdog, which accuses Google of abusing its dominant position and favoring its own products over those of competitors. The company has denied the allegations. Governments have taken particular aim at complex corporate structures that allow companies to book revenue in low-tax jurisdictions, such as Luxembourg and Ireland, that they have earned in high-tax countries such as Italy. Last August, the commission ordered Apple Inc. to return $13 billion to Ireland in unpaid taxes. Apple is appealing, as is Ireland, which accuses Brussels of meddling in its domestic tax affairs. Italy has been especially aggressive in pursuing tech giants. In late 2015, Apple Inc. agreed to pay about EUR318 million to end a dispute in which the company allegedly failed to pay almost EUR900 million in taxes between 2008 and 2013. Other U.S. multinationals, including Amazon.com and Facebook Inc., are also under scrutiny in Italy. Tax police have told Amazon they believe the company has evaded around EUR130 million of taxes in Italy on EUR2.5 billion in sales effected through the company's Italian website between 2011 and 2015, according to people familiar with the matter. In a statement, Amazon said it pays "all the taxes we are required to pay in every country where we operate." "Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given our heavy investments and the fact that retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business," said Amazon, which has invested EUR800 million in Italy since 2010. People familiar with the situation say an Italian investigation into Facebook is also continuing. Facebook didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.

Google is warning users Wednesday, May 3, 2017, to beware of a phishing scam spread by a fraudulent invitation to share a Google Doc. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) MILAN (AP) — Italian tax officials say Google has agreed to pay 306 million euros ($335 million) to settle an ongoing tax dispute. Google has been under investigation by Milan prosecutors for the tax years 2009-2013, one of several European probes looking into the tax practices of international companies. Tax officials said the settlement announced Thursday also launches a process to determine the tech company's proper taxation level in Italy going forward. The agreement covers the period under investigation, as well as 2014-2015 and 2002-2006. Google acknowledged the settlement, saying 303 million euros were attributed to Google Italy and the remainder to Google Ireland and was "in addition to the corporate tax already paid in Italy for these years." Google said it remained committed to Italy. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 74 Plus 1 on G+ 313 Share on Facebook 119 Share on Twitter Total Shares506 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Stock Android is always buttery smooth. Even when it isn't. Louis Smith I'm in the same boat. Sold my OP3, Loved the phone, but someone else wanted it. I just kept on going back to my N6P. Hopefully the next one will be the same size as the 6P Matt He wants to be exclusive. He's a jealous Pixel lover.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is. I like mine. I still prefer my s7e over it. Maybe pixel 2 will better Vic Chai Was Nexus 6P your number one choice? Jon I've only ever connected to a Bluetooth speaker but never had a single Bluetooth issue ever.. Captain On! To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

Now that Android Wear is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table comparing every watch. You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device. The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However, the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch snfaces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395. The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform. Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great.

I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bābā ghanūj Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging.

But as hot as it may be, the feature wasn’t ready for public consumption when Google released the final Nougat build last year. However, things might change soon, as Google is apparently getting ready to enable it on devices running Android 7 as well as phones and tablets running older Android versions. Don't Miss: No iPhone user can even imagine dealing with what Android users have to tolerate Instant Apps will let users enjoy instant app experiences on their smartphones without actually downloading a particular app for. Assuming it works as described, the feature will solve a bunch of problems. First of all, it’ll help save storage on the phone, as you won’t have to keep an app installed just because you might have to use it every now and then. Secondly, you won’t have to buy an app to try it since developers will be able to offer a portion of an app to test for free. Finally, the Instant Apps features will work on most Android devices out there, not just Nougat-based ones, as it’s built on Google Play Services. Looking at the code in the latest version of Google Play Store, 9to5Google discovered that Google might be getting ready to roll out Instant Apps. The code reveals that users will be able to enable or disable the feature and choose which Google account to use with an app. Here’s Google’s demo of Instant Apps: 9to5Google also mentions several new features in the Google Play Store 7.8 update, including a Google Play app discovery service, a pre-registration rewards features for apps, and a new security branding for Verify Apps — that’s Play Protect.

Google will now let you share your location with friends in Maps Video Samsung DeX: The Galaxy S8 desktop dock really works Back when Google shut down its crowd-sourced Map Maker on March 31, it promised to integrate “many of its features” into Google Maps. However, while the options to edit descriptions and suggest missing places is prominently displayed in Maps, Google has also added the ability to edit road segments, but it’s a little harder to find. In an April 27 update to Google’s Local Guides Connect board, moderator CorrieD announced that Google has launched “the first part of a revamped editing flow in Google Maps targeting road segment editing.” The new Maps integration features “a new selection UI and the ability to report issues on multiple road segments” on both the desktop version of Google Maps and the Android app. To use the new road editor, you need to head over to the Send feedback tab in the sidebar. Inside you’ll find options to add a missing place, report a missing road, and report a location issue as before, but now there will be a new one called Edit the map. Tap it, and you’ll be brought to a new screen that shows you all of the roads around you and lets you tap to select all or part of one. Once you’ve pinpointed the area you want to change, tap Next, and you’ll be able to choose from a series of problems: incorrectly drawn, one-way, two-way incorrect, closed, or private. You can choose as many that apply, add a note describing the issue, and send it to Google for review. The feature appears to have been pushed out with the most recent update, but if you’re not seeing it, you can side-load the latest Google-signed APK from APKMirror. It’s unclear whether Google will bring the feature to the iOS app as well. Open road: Map Maker was a great way for the public to help Google make Maps even better, and it’s even more useful built right into the app. We wouldn’t mind Google making it a little easier to find in the future, but we’re glad it was integrated so quickly.

Mobile version Sign Up Login Home Lebanon Middle East World Business Sports Climate Change & Environment Entertainment Offbeat Culture Science Obituaries Technology Health Entrepreneurship Roundup En ع Google Coughs Up 306 Million Euros in Italy Tax Settlement by Naharnet Newsdesk 04 May 2017, 20:19 Comment 0 Tweet Google said Thursday that it would pay 306 million euros ($334 million) to settle a tax dispute in Italy, where it was under criminal investigation for booking profits generated in the country in Ireland. In a move echoing a similar settlement with Apple in December 2015, Italy's tax agency said the payment settled Google's liabilities between 2009 and 2013, the period under investigation by Italy's Financial Police (GdF) coordinated by the chief public prosecutor in Milan. The settlement also puts an end to separate disputes covering the periods of 2002-2006 and 2014-2015. "We have also begun the process of drawing up an agreement that will ensure Google pays the correct taxes in Italy in the future," the tax agency said in a statement. "The agency confirms its commitment to pursue fiscal controls on the activities of web-based multinationals in Italy." Google confirmed it had reached an agreement with the authorities without commenting on whether it accepted the revenue's calculations. The company has defended the legality of channeling European earnings through its base in Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union. "Google and the Italian Revenue Agency have reached a settlement, resolving a tax inquiry for a period between 2002 and 2015 without litigation," a spokesman said. "In addition to the corporation tax already paid in Italy for these years, Google will pay an additional 306 million euros. "Of this, over 303 million has been attributed to Google Italy and less than 3 million attributed to Google Ireland. We remain committed to Italy and will continue to help grow the online ecosystem." - Amazon next in line? - Apple paid 318 million euros at the end of 2015 to settle a dispute over Italian earnings dating back to 2008. Reports at the time said the payment was a discounted settlement of over 800 million euros of unpaid corporation tax, one of several disputes arising from a U.S. multinational basing European operations in Ireland. Local media reports say Amazon is next in the Italian tax agency's firing line. The Milan prosecutor was reportedly handed a file last week which says the American online retailer owes 130 million euros. That dispute is related to the company's channeling earnings through Luxembourg. Amazon has defended its returns in Italy, saying its heavy investments in the country explain its low profits and therefore its tax bill. The tax affairs of multinationals in increasingly open developed economies have come under intense scrutiny in recent years. At a time of widespread fiscal austerity in Europe, controversy has mounted over cross-border corporations that "shop around" between different countries for the most advantageous deals, sometimes resulting in secret and potentially illegal "sweetheart" arrangements. American lawmakers, meanwhile, are demanding that U.S.-based multinationals repatriate more of their profits and pay taxes on them. The companies insist that they are operating within the law: Apple chief executive Tim Cook memorably termed the notion of his company stashing cash overseas as "political crap."

Countless users across the globe received emails informing them that a contact they know has sent them a Google Docs file when in reality they hadn’t. Those who fell for it ended up allowing the app to access their account and spread the phishing scam to more contacts through their accounts. Google put a stop to it quickly and it has now released a new update for the Gmail for Android app so that it’s even better at blocking such attacks. Phishing refers to the fraudulent act of sending emails to unsuspecting users purporting to be from contacts and companies that they know in a bid to extract personal information like passwords, credit card numbers, addresses etc from them. Gmail for Android now has an anti-phishing security check. The app will provide users with an additional warning when they click on a link in an email that the app deems to be suspicious. “The site you are trying to visit has been identified as a forgery, intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal or other sensitive information,” the warning will read. It will also show an option to open the link anyway at the user’s own risk or to report it as an incorrect warning. Google says that this new anti-phishing measure is going to be rolled out gradually for all Gmail for Android users over the coming days. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Apps and GMail.

The latter seems to be the case in this situation as well, only the way in which the attack is conducted is a little more sophisticated. According to BGR, many people using their personal Gmail accounts, as well as "multiple organizations using Google for email", have been affected by a new phishing attack that's being transmitted via a link to a Google Docs file. The entire thing starts with an email from a contact you know, which contains a link to a shared file from Google Docs. Upon clicking the link, you are redirected to a legitimate Google sign-in page, where after logging in, you are asked to let a legitimate-looking - but not actually genuine -﻿ "Google Docs" app read, send, or delete your emails. @zeynep Just got this as well. Super sophisticated. pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX — Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017 Though a compromised email account can give nefarious third parties access to your other accounts, the best way to combat the attack is to simply use two-factor authentication. If you have already been affected, you can take an extra step and remove the fake "Google Docs" app's access to your emails in the Connected Apps & Sites section of Google account settings. Source: BGR Update: As has been pointed out in the comments, access to the app has been revoked by Google, and the issue is now solved. Here is the official statement via a tweet on the official Google Docs Twitter account: We've addressed the issue with a phishing email claiming to be Google Docs.

If you’re running a little behind, or are afraid something won’t ship in time, though, Google Photos will make you a sappy little movie using images in your camera roll — that is, if you have pictures of your mom stored in the service. The tool is pretty simple: Google Photos will give you a visual list of faces it recognizes in your photos and let you select which one is your mom. Then, you can pick the children — whether that’s you, your siblings, your kids, or maybe close friends that feel like family to you all. The AI doesn’t appear to discriminate between male or female faces — you can pick basically anyone you consider to be your “mother” for the movie. (It even gave me a shot of the dude from the Burger King Google Home commercial... which is, um, not weird at all.) After a few minutes, the movie should show up in your Assistant tab. I just got a new phone so I don’t have many photos of my mother in my camera roll, which meant the movie mostly featured pictures of myself from my Gmail profile. Awkward! It also doesn’t let you edit the images it picked for the movie, unlike Facebook’s movies for friendship anniversaries, birthdays, and New Year’s. If you keep images backed up from other devices, or have a good collection of family pictures in Google Photos already, this is a simple and easy tool to create something to make mom smile. But you might still want to get her something else on the side or plan to spend time with her on the day. I don’t think my mom will be that impressed with a video featuring two pictures of us together, and a bunch of us separately.

The Motley Fool has a skill integration with the Google Assistant on Google Home!  You can check your stocks while washing the dishes ... or lounging on the couch away from your electronics ... or cooking dinner ... or taking a bubble bath. The Motley Fool launched on the Actions on Google platform last fall and is the default provider for stock watchlists -- so you'll get the Fool any time you ask about how your stocks are doing. Source: Google In case you aren't in the loop, here is a little FAQ: What is Google Home? If you're not among those who have invited Google Home into your, um, home, allow us a brief introduction. It's a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant. Ask it questions. Tell it to do things. It's your own Google, always ready to help. Just start with, "Ok Google." If you feel a pressing need to learn more or to buy one, go here and get started with monitoring your investments (our favorite use). What information can I get from The Motley Fool with the Google Assistant on Google Home? The Motley Fool on Google Home lets you ask for a stock quote by speaking the name of a company or a major index (Dow Jones, Nasdaq, or S&P). There's no need to memorize tickers or deal with the frustration of our alphabet containing so many letters that sound similar ("Did you say B or V?" "No, I said P!"). You can also create and manage a stock watchlist, easily adding and removing stocks you want to follow, and getting an overview of your watchlist's daily performance. Here are some things you can ask: Ok Google, how is my watchlist doing? Ok Google, ask The Motley Fool for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Ok Google, ask The Motley Fool how the Dow is doing. Ok Google, ask The Motley Fool to add Verizon Comunications (NYSE:VZ) to my watchlist. Want to know how such a skill might work in real life? Here's Motley Fool radio and podcast personality Chris Hill taking the Google Assistant for a test drive. How do I enable The Motley Fool action for the Google Assistant on Google Home? Your Motley Fool action is automatically enabled for all Google Home devices. BUT in order for you to experience all the magic of our watchlist, you'll need to go into your Google Home app, choose Settings, and then turn on "Personal results." They must be enabled in order for your watchlist to work. How much will this cost me? The Motley Fool action is free of charge. Woo hoo! Do I need a Motley Fool account to use this? Nope! Looking up a company and building a watchlist are all available without an account. As we get feedback from our users, we'll explore additional functionality that might need to be stored with a Motley Fool account, or even tools that integrate with the Fool's suite of premium services.

Google said the rollout will be gradual, over the next few days. "While not all affected email will necessarily be dangerous, we encourage you to be extra careful about clicking on links in messages that you’re not sure about. And with this update, you’ll have another tool to make these kinds of decisions." The phishing attack, which attempted to tap into your Google account by clicking a phony link, affected under 0.1% of Gmail users, says Google. That roughly translates to least 1 million users. Google had said in February 2016 that were over 1 billion Gmail users. Google says it was able to stop the phishing campaign within one hour. "While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed." On Google's help page about phishing, the company says hackers are generally in search of your usernames, passwords, social security numbers, bank account, mother's maiden name and your birthday. Google will never ask for this type of information in an e-mail, Google says. We reached out to Google to ask about the status of features for the iOS app, and the company said "We have nothing to share at this time."

The settlement covers taxes on profits from 2002-15, which the Italian government said Google made in the country but transferred to other European countries where corporate taxes are much lower. Google worked out a similar deal with Britain last year, agreeing to pay $185 million in back taxes. The French government is pursuing its own tax case in its courts. Apple has faced similar investigations by Eurozone countries, which can set their own tax rates. Some countries like Ireland and Luxembourg charge little or no corporate taxes in a bid to lure foreign investment, while others charge 30 percent or higher. Some U.S.-based companies like Google and Apple that make billions in profits across Europe have used those low-tax countries as a base for European operations. Regulators both for the European Union and individual countries allege the companies then transfer profits back to their outposts in the low-tax countries to avoid paying higher rates elsewhere. In Apple's case, the European Authority, which administers EU law, ordered the Irish government to levy Apple a whopping $14 billion tax bill after regulators said the Irish government helped Apple avoid paying other Eurozone taxes for 20 years. Both Apple and the Irish government have appealed the decision.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Search Any Site from Chrome’s Address Bar By Cameron Summerson on May 4th, 2017 Chrome is the browser of choice for many people, and if you’re looking to supercharge your search game, there’s a quick and easy way to search all of your favorite sites directly from the address bar (or as Google calls it, the Omnibox). Let’s talk about it. RELATED ARTICLE How to Search Google Drive Directly from Chrome’s Address Bar We’ve already covered searching Google Drive from the omnibox, and this same basic method can be used to search any site across the board. Even if a site doesn’t have a dedicated search, you can use Google to search only that site, which is super rad. We’ll cover both methods here: sites with a dedicated search function, as well as sites that you’d rather use Google for. How to Use a Website’s Search Tool from the Address Bar For the sake of example, let’s say you use Amazon all the time. Instead of going to the site and hitting up Amazon’s search bar for what you’re looking for, you can shave seconds off your time by just doing it directly from Chrome. You can go ahead and start planning what you’ll do with all that extra time. To do this, we’re going to set up a custom search engine within Chrome using Amazon-specific parameters. So go ahead and jump to Amazon, then search for something. You’ll need the URL after a search has been executed. It’ll look like this: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=galaxy+s8 The search string is fairly lengthy, but you’ll need to copy the entire thing. We’ll change a bit of it in the coming steps. Next, go ahead and click the three-dot button in the top right corner in Chrome, then choose Settings. From here, scroll down to the “Search Engines” section, and click “Manage search engines.” Under this menu, click “Add” next to the Other Search Engines section header. In the first box, enter the name of the site you’ll be searching. In this example, we’re using Amazon. In the second box, entire a shortcode—again, related the site you’re searching. I’m going with “amn” here, but you can use whatever shortcode you want. Finally, paste the link you copied earlier. But here’s the important bit: you’ll need to change search query to %s in the URL. So, basically, remove the term you searched for from the string and replace it with %s . So this: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=galaxy+s8 Becomes this: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=%s At the end, it should look like this: Click “Save” at the bottom, and you’re finished. From now on, you can just type “amn” and the space bar in the omnibox, followed by your search query to quickly search Amazon. Again, this can easily be modified for whatever site you like, just simply remove your search query from the link and replace it with %s . How to Search a Specific Site using Google from the Address Bar If a certain site doesn’t have a search function (or the search function is lacking), then you can also search specific sites using Google. In turn, you can use this search to create a custom search engine in Chrome to make it super fast and easy. For example, let’s say you really like a site called How-to Geek, and you want to be able to search it for tech knowledge at a moment’s notice. You can search Google for just pages on How-To Geek using a very similar trick to the above. First off, you’ll need to know how to tell Google you what site you want to search. It’s actually really easy, as it’s something that’s built into Google natively. Use this command: site:howtogeek.com <search term> Once you enter that, it basically tells Google that you want to search that one particular site for the query. In this scenario, I searched the site for “Android,” so the URL looks a little something like this: https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS439US439&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=site:howtogeek.com+android That’s what we’re going to use to create our custom Google search. Back in Chrome, click the three dots in the upper right corner, then select “Settings.” Scroll down until you see the Search Engines category, and click on “Manage Search Engines.” Click “Add” next to the Other Search Engines header. In this dialog box, enter the name for your custom search in the first spot. We’re just calling this one “Google HTG Search,” but you can change the name accordingly (especially if you’re using a different site). In the second box, enter a custom search keyword, which is what you’ll use to execute the command. We’ll use “htg” here, but again you can change it accord to your needs. Lastly, we’ll enter the custom URL. You’ll use the exact URL you copied earlier, but change one key piece. At the very end of the URL, you’ll remove the search term and replace it with %s. So, in our example, this: https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS439US439&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=site:howtogeek.com+android Becomes this: https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS439US439&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=site:howtogeek.com+%s Make sure to only change the term after the plus sign at the end—everything before that is necessary to properly execute the command. So, the end result should look like this (again, assuming you’re following along with our exact scenario here): At that point, you just need to enter the search term—in our case, “htg”—followed by a space and your query. Bam, you just searched a specific site using Google.   This is a really quick and simple way to execute a search for any site on the web, which will provide more meaningful results for a specific topic. I have dozens of these searches set up, which decreases the amount of time I spend digging through results exponentially. In both of our examples, you need only modify the search string for your specific needs.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Clear Your Google Search History By Michael Crider on May 4th, 2017 Google knows quite a lot about you based on your search history. That’s kind of the point of search, to learn about people and serve them relevant advertising. But fortunately, the company’s user-facing tools allow you to remove that knowledge at your leisure. Open your browser and head to myactivity.google.com. Click the menu in the upper left-hand corner of the page, and choose “Activity Controls” from the list. Under Web & App Activity, click “Manage Activity.” Click on the three-dots menu next to any individual session to delete those items, or the three-dots menu at the top to delete your entire history. History can be cleared in a total “clean slate” fashion, or individual entries can be deleted for those (ahem) delicate inquiries that you’d rather no one else know about. Here’s how to do both. (Note: You can also do some of this on Android, as well, if you aren’t near a computer.) How to Delete Your Entire Search History (Plus Other Stuff) Your history with Google Search, along with all the other Google services you use like Android, the Chrome Browser, and YouTube, is stored in your My Activity page. Go to myactivity.google.com and you can see more or less everything you’ve done that Google knows about. Don’t worry, you’re the only user who has access to this stuff—Google anonymizes the data as it uses it to serve ads and analyze trends. To clear your history, click on the hamburger menu on the upper left-hand side of the myactivity.google.com page (that’s the three horizontal bars next to “Google”), then click “Activity Controls” in the side menu. Under the first item, Web & App Activity, click “Manage Activity.” You’ll see all of the items you searched for, and if you use Android and Chrome with the account you’re signed into, all of the apps and websites you visited as well. They’re separated into “sessions,” grouped bits of activity based on time. It’s possible to delete these individually with the three-dot menus in the upper-right corner of each. To delete absolutely everything here, click the three-dot menu in the top blue bar, then click “Delete activity by.” From this page, you can delete all of your activity for all monitored searches, websites, and Android apps. Under “Delete by date,” select “All time.” You can leave the default “All products” selected, or choose only “Search” to delete just your Google search history. How to Delete Your Activity for Individual Services Follow the instructions above, arriving at the “Delete activity by” section. But before clicking the “Delete” button, open the final drop-down menu. Here you can delete your search and usage data for a staggering amount of Google services. It’s a bit hard to see at once on the web, so here’s the full list: Ads Android Assistant Books Chrome Developers Express Finance Google+ Help Image Search Maps Maps Timeline News Play Play Music Search Shopping Note that the itemized list isn’t exactly straightforward. For example, if you performed a Google Search for “Couches” in the browser, but then clicked on “Images” for image-based results, you’ve left separate histories in both the standard Google Search and Google Image Search. Some of Google’s services also don’t appear here, like YouTube (see below). The date settings mentioned earlier can be used here, allowing users to select one or all services and delete by “Today,” “Yesterday,” “Last 7 days,” “Last 30 days,” “All time,” or a custom range of dates selected with the calendar tool. When you’ve selected your date range and service, click “Delete” to clear out that particular history. How to Delete Individual Search Items If there’s just one thing you want to delete, leaving the rest of your Google history intact, head back to the Google My Activity page, myactivity.google.com. If you know the precise date and time of the search or activity you want to clear, you can find it on the reverse timeline on this page. You may need to click the “X items” under a timed session to expand the view. The timeline scrolls infinitely; you can just keep going to the bottom of the page for more results. To delete the full timed session, click the three-dot menu button at the top of the section, then “Delete.”  To delete only a single entry, click “details” under the single item, then once again choose the three-dot menu and “delete.” If you don’t know the date of the item you want to get rid of, search for it using field at the top of the page. You can further narrow the results with the “Filter by date & product” option. Here you can select specific Google services and a date range to find whatever activity you want to delete. Once again, when you find it click the three-dot menu and then delete. How to Delete Your Location History, YouTube History, and Voice Activity A few Google services aren’t included in the full deletion tools above. These are: Location History Device Information (Android and Chrome OS contacts, calendars, technical data, and certain app usage) Voice & Audio History (“OK Google” searches and similar) YouTube Search History YouTube Watch History To get to the deletion tools for these specific services, click the side-menu on myactivity.google.com again, then click “Activity Controls.” You’ll be taken back to the Google-wide management page, with a new card-style section for each service. The history for each of them can be turned on or off by clicking the blue toggle underneath the header image. Click “Manage” and you’ll be taken to another page…which is unfortunately a different page for each service. For Location History, you’re taken to the page below. Click the settings icon (the gear logo) in the bottom-right corner, then “Delete all Location History.” You can also pause your location history with this menu. For the rest of the services on this list, the user interface is the same. Click “manage,” then on the next page click the three-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner. Click “Delete all” or “Delete activity by” depending on the service, which presents you with the same date range as the multi-service tool above. Remember that Google uses tracking on Search and all its other services to inform your personal search results, among other things. So if you’re systematically clearing out all of the historical data from your Google account. Don’t be surprised if your search results change significantly for the affected account.

Now that Android Wear is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table comparing every watch. You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device. The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However, the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch snfaces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395. The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except GPS and a heart rate sensor (and possibly a speaker, Verizon hasn't confirmed that). When the Wear24 goes on sale, you'll be able to buy it for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. It also remains to be seen how bulky the watch will be - that was definitely a problem for the Watch Sport, and Verizon hasn't released any photos. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform. Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bābā ghanūj Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging.

Google Adds Phishing Protection To Android Gmail App Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Adds Phishing Protection To Android Gmail App May 4, 2017 12:29 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler email gmail google hack hack attack Phishing proceed with caution spam warning we're warning you Yesterday, millions of Gmail users became the targets of a phishing scam in which someone they knew sent a Google Doc for them to edit. Once they clicked on the email, however, they opened their computers and email accounts to ne’er-do-wells. Now, Google is launching an update that may make it easier for users to decipher when an email is suspicious — as long as they’re using the Android app.  Google announced Wednesday that it launched a new security feature for its Gmail Android app that aims to help users keep their accounts safe from hackers. With the new feature, when a user clicks on a suspicious link in a message, a message, a pop-up notice from Gmail will warn that phishing is suspected. “The site you are trying to visit has been identified as a forgery intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal, or other sensitive information,’ the notice states. “You can continue to [the link] at your own risk.” While Google notes that not all emails to receive the warning will be dangerous, users should be “extra careful about clicking on links in messages that you’re not sure about.” The warning also includes an option where users can indicate that they don’t believe that the site is actually a phishing site and that the warning is incorrect. TechCrunch notes that while the new warning might not have flagged yesterday’s Google Doc phishing email — as it wasn’t linking to an outside source — the new warnings could help prevent other widespread attempted hacks. As for Wednesday’s hack, Google say sit has taken actions to disable offending accounts and made updates to its Safe Browsing system.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About May 5, 2017 Google AIY: Artificial Intelligence Yourself 30 Comments by: Inderpreet Singh May 4, 2017 When Amazon released the API to their voice service Alexa, they basically forced any serious players in this domain to bring their offerings out into the hacker/maker market as well. Now Google and Raspberry Pi have come together to bring us ‘Artificial Intelligence Yourself’ or AIY. A free hardware kit made by Google was distributed with Issue 57 of the MagPi Magazine which is targeted at makers and hobbyists which you can see in the video after the break. The kit contains a Raspberry Pi Voice Hat, a microphone board, a speaker and a number of small bits to mount the kit on a Raspberry Pi 3. Putting all of it together and following the instruction on the official site gets you a Google Voice Interaction Kit with a bunch of IOs just screaming to be put to good use. The source code for the python app can be downloaded from GitHub and consists of a loop that awaits a trigger. This trigger can be a press of a button or a clap near the microphones. When a trigger is detected, the recorder function takes over sending the stream to the Google Cloud. Speech-to-Text conversion happens there and the result is returned via a Text-To-Speech engine that helps the system talk back. The repository suggests that the official Voice Kit SD Image (893 MB download) is based on Raspbian so don’t go reflashing a memory card right away, you should be able to add this to an existing install. And if you don’t have access to the official kit yet but are just itching to give it a try then look no further. Google was kind enough to put up a Guide to add Google Assistant support to the Raspberry Pi 3. The single board computer already has a speaker output and there are a plethora of USB microphones out that will do the job. USB sounds cards work just fine as well and after you follow the instructions to setup the Google SDK, you got yourself an Assistant. If you want to complete the Google AIY Kit experience, you will have to do a bit of hacking. Adding a push button to trigger the Assistant Script is pretty simple and if someone wants to add a DIY Clap Trigger instead, go right ahead.

Report comment Reply RicoElectrico says: May 4, 2017 at 8:47 am Oh, and easy to train. Report comment Reply Alex says: May 4, 2017 at 2:06 pm The best fully open-source one I know of is Pocketsphinx, which is a full speech recognition engine, or if you’re willing to use a partially open-source one then Snowboy is supposed to be quite good – the only issue is that you have to train the voice model online, but after that the recognition runs completely offline. Report comment Reply Haydn says: May 4, 2017 at 8:47 am sold out :( Report comment Reply Rog Fanther says: May 4, 2017 at 8:48 am I´ll wait for them to launch something that can be installed in the pi and run disconnected from the cloud. Report comment Reply Doc Oct says: May 4, 2017 at 8:52 am I’d also prefer to have something that can run outside of Google’s servers and therefore out of their sight. It creeps me out enough that they cache all queries you make via the Google Now voice questions. Report comment Reply CodeReclaimers says: May 4, 2017 at 9:01 am Yeah I’m not a fan of all these AI products that run in a black box on somebody else’s machines. I’ve already got enough devices reporting on my behavior, I don’t need to add more with a hobby project. Surely there’s a voice recognition approach that’s lightweight enough to run on a Pi or some other hobby-sized machine? Report comment Reply Alphatek says: May 4, 2017 at 2:23 pm 20+ years ago, I saw good voice-independent recognition on an ARM7 @ 30MHz, so you’d hope so Report comment Reply Nitori says: May 4, 2017 at 9:38 pm Yah I want to see a project where all the software runs inside the actual device or at least on your own server. Report comment Reply salec says: May 4, 2017 at 10:13 am Perhaps you can use Google cloud to fast train your own ANN? If an embedded machine can encompass it, that is. Feed it broadcasts and Google obtained records of the same, so that you don’t compromise your own privacy. Report comment Reply Rog Fanther says: May 4, 2017 at 10:28 am Not even for privacity, but sometimes you want to install something using this in a place without internet connection. Also, about running in the pi : we had reasonably workable voice recognitin since OS/2 time. So, Dragon Dictate and others worked in 386´s and 486´s. Given the processing power of the pi, I would hope it should be more than capable to run something like this. Maybe if google would really code something for it, instead of piling some bloated java libraries to the task Report comment Reply nic0mac says: May 4, 2017 at 10:39 am Cant seem to find how to do it in the instructions but on their developer blog page it does say ” instructions to build a Voice User Interface (VUI) that can use cloud services (like the new Google Assistant SDK or Cloud Speech API) or run completely on-device. ” So I’m guessing that there is a way to run it offline just with less functionality depending on your device, or maybe i’m wrong… Report comment Reply Jklu says: May 4, 2017 at 12:10 pm It seems to be in the config: https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/blob/master/config/voice-recognizer.ini.default#L7 Report comment Reply nic0mac says: May 4, 2017 at 1:02 pm cool, Thanks for not telling me i was wrong, I hadn’t looked that hard yet. This might make a better way to access the security feed of the driveway on the tv, cause you know, finding the remote and pressing 3 buttons or just looking out the window when i hear a car pull up is way to hard sometimes. Report comment Reply Jklu says: May 4, 2017 at 12:05 pm You might want to have a look at Jasper ( http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation/configuration/ ) which offers a choice of speech recognition engines including 2 offline variants Report comment Reply Ken Quast says: May 4, 2017 at 8:54 am More data and information for Google. Yea! Report comment Reply Clovis Fritzen says: May 4, 2017 at 10:07 am Using our data is their business, that has not been a surprise to anyone since 1998, sir. Report comment Reply coromd says: May 4, 2017 at 4:24 pm It can’t hear you until you press enter or use something to trigger the detection. As of right now the only standalone device that can OK Google or run “always on” is the Google Home. Report comment Reply Tweepy says: May 4, 2017 at 9:23 am What the point of this? How is it different? As long GAFAM are in the loop, I wont be using such system. Report comment Reply 𐂀 𐂅 says: May 4, 2017 at 2:33 pm It is an educational toy, if you need security and privacy such systems are not appropriate. However you can use voice APIs to help train your own voice-to-text-to-action system and then just run the local neural network when it is competent enough. Report comment Reply kryptylomese says: May 4, 2017 at 9:47 am Please make the kit available to purchase separately from the magazine? Report comment Reply notarealemail says: May 4, 2017 at 9:55 am https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/aiy-projects-voice-kit.html Report comment Reply notarealemail says: May 4, 2017 at 9:58 am The Voice Kit ships out to all MagPi Magazine subscribers on May 4, 2017, and we’ve published a parts list, assembly instructions, source code and suggested extensions to our website: aiyprojects.withgoogle.com. The complete kit is also for sale at over 500 Barnes & Noble stores nationwide, as well as UK retailers WH Smith, Tesco, Sainsburys, and Asda. Report comment Reply haydn says: May 4, 2017 at 10:37 am I think they may mean those UK retailers as stocking the magpi magazine, as they don’t stock raspi, or any other electronics stuff. I just returned from a couple that had empty spaces where magpi should have been, and all online places have sold out. £20 start price on ebay. Report comment Reply MCenderdragon says: May 4, 2017 at 10:44 am So how much data is send to goolge? I sgoogle only use for speech-to-text or also the complte AI task? If it was only the STT then we simply use keyboard as input. But currently this sounds like speech to google. goolge is making it to text feed an AI, AI doing magic, google send back text, text-to-spech on raspi is talking to you. Report comment Reply 𐂀 𐂅 says: May 4, 2017 at 2:29 pm You can do all this, and a lot more with a $50 Android 6.0 phone, a custom App and any number of ESP8266 enabled “things”. Google’s offering is for children, not hardware hackers. Report comment Reply Low Grade Source says: May 4, 2017 at 3:59 pm There are a ton of speech recognition module(s) (<- search it) on Aliexpress. They are mostly limited to phrase recognition and have hard limits of around 20 to 170 phrases for ~$15-$80. Probably good enough for most uses but definitely not an AI interface. Need more phrases? get a second board ;) Report comment Reply Steve says: May 4, 2017 at 4:26 pm Got a Mag Pi and the kit this afternoon at an out-of-the-way WH Smiths near where I was working. All works quite nicely. Was very easy to get it up and running. The Voice Hat is really interesting though – lots of other breakouts on it – not just a speaker output, mic input and button input. The kit comes with a header strip to let you populate : I2C and SPI breakouts What look like 6 Servo outputs and 4 ‘Drivers’ (motor drivers?) There is an unpopulated DC-in barrel jack pads (the Mag Pi article boards show it populated) and some other jumpers too. Not bad for a giveaway with a GBP £5.99 magazine. Report comment Reply Steve says: May 4, 2017 at 4:30 pm Meant unpopulated headers – not jumpers. Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...
