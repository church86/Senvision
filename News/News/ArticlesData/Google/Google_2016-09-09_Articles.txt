Just Ask Hiroshima. Julie Makinen | Los Angeles Times “Before the war, the savory crepes—whose lineage can be traced to Chinese pancakes known as jianbing—were sold as kids’ snacks throughout Hiroshima. Then, after 1945, war widows anxious to make ends meet started opening okonomiyaki stalls and some converted rooms in their homes into small restaurants. They threw in whatever ingredients they could get their hands on, such as oysters and squid and soba noodles cooked by their fellow stall owners, along with ration ingredients provided by the U.S. occupiers. The elaboration was all well and good, because okonomiyaki literally means “whatever you like—grilled,” and in the lean years after the war, cheap one-dish meals were all many Hiroshimans could afford.” * * * Google’s Clever Plan to Stop Aspiring ISIS Recruits Andy Greenberg | WIRED “Jigsaw, the Google-owned tech incubator and think tank—until recently known as Google Ideas—has been working over the past year to develop a new program it hopes can use a combination of Google’s search advertising algorithms and YouTube’s video platform to target aspiring ISIS recruits and ultimately dissuade them from joining the group’s cult of apocalyptic violence. The program, which Jigsaw calls the Redirect Method and plans to launch in a new phase this month, places advertising alongside results for any keywords and phrases that Jigsaw has determined people attracted to ISIS commonly search for. Those ads link to Arabic- and English-language YouTube channels that pull together preexisting videos Jigsaw believes can effectively undo ISIS’s brainwashing—clips like testimonials from former extremists, imams denouncing ISIS’s corruption of Islam, and surreptitiously filmed clips inside the group’s dysfunctional caliphate in Northern Syria and Iraq.” * * * Reforming Ukraine After the Revolutions Joshua Yaffa | The New Yorker “Wen Sergii Leshchenko was at university, in Ukraine, he dreamed of working in television news. He is the son of two Soviet-trained engineers, and grew up in Kiev, where he studied journalism. He aspired to become an on-air correspondent, but his speech was mumbly and imprecise. After an unsuccessful summer internship at a local news channel, in 2000, he heard that a new online publication, Ukrayinska Pravda, was desperately looking for reporters; in recent weeks, nearly all the staff had quit, fed up with low pay and worn down by pressure from authorities. His interview took place in a cramped and sparsely furnished three-room apartment, where he was met by the site’s founder and editor-in-chief, Georgiy Gongadze, a thirty-one-year-old reporter. Gongadze regularly received threats from Ukrainian officials because of his muckraking investigations. The power was out in the apartment, so Leshchenko and Gongadze sat in darkness. After a few minutes, Gongadze told him that he could start right away.” * * * Human Rights in Colombia’s City of Women Kary Stewart | Pacific Standard “At that time the Colombian government had no strategy in place to deal with this influx of emigrant women. They were left to live in slums, building shelters from scraps they found and doing whatever work they could to feed their children. There was no water, sanitation, or any other basic facilities. ‘We lived in subhuman conditions,’ Mejía recalls. ‘Our homes were built on dirt and our children walked about barefoot. All we could do was cling to the hope that we had arrived with.’” * * * Trapped in Homs, Architect Imagines a New Future for Syrian Cities Stephen Heyman | The New York Times “Did Syria’s urban architecture help fuel the civil war that has shattered the country and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people? This is the provocative theory proposed by Marwa al-Sabouni, a young architect from Homs who spent two years confined to her apartment with her husband and two children as the city’s historic heart was reduced to rubble. In a Ted talk (now viewed over 500,000 times) and a recent book, “The Battle for Home,” Ms. Sabouni, 34, performs a kind of architectural autopsy on her native city, cataloging failings of design and infrastructure that she said paved the way for its eventual destruction.” * * * The Shipping Noose Joshua Keating | Slate “You probably didn’t notice it while running errands last weekend, but the vast global network that moves foreign-made boxer shorts and Bluetooth headsets to your neighborhood store is experiencing a major malfunction. Last week, South Korean shipping company Hanjin, the world’s seventh-largest container line, filed for bankruptcy after failing to reach an agreement with its creditors to alleviate its $5.37 billion in debt. This has left 85 of the 97 container ships the company operates literally stranded at sea, as ports refused to admit them for fear that stevedores and tugboat crews won’t be paid. Even if the situation is resolved soon, the unprecedented mess is an ominous indicator about the state of global trade.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video A Portrait of the Tensions in Coal Country The documentary Blood on the Mountain explores the war over West Virginia's past and future.

On the morning of Monday, August 13, 2012, Scott Stevens loaded a brown hunting bag into his Jeep Grand Cherokee, then went to the master bedroom, where he hugged Stacy, his wife of 23 years. “I love you,” he told her. Stacy thought that her husband was off to a job interview followed by an appointment with his therapist. Instead, he drove the 22 miles from their home in Steubenville, Ohio, to the Mountaineer Casino, just outside New Cumberland, West Virginia. He used the casino ATM to check his bank-account balance: $13,400. He walked across the casino floor to his favorite slot machine in the high-limit area: Triple Stars, a three-reel game that cost $10 a spin. Maybe this time it would pay out enough to save him. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Why Hillary Clinton Lost Molly Ball As devastated Democrats cast about for explanations, her campaign’s decisions have come under scrutiny. Why did Hillary Clinton lose last week’s presidential election? The candidate herself believes James Comey, the FBI director who notified Congress in an October 28 letter that he was reopening the inquiry into her private emails, was to blame. Her campaign, meanwhile, has cited “a host of uncontrollable headwinds,” asserting that her team did all they could in an unforeseeably difficult environment. Many Democrats, however, are less forgiving of the campaign and its strategy. It may be true that the Comey letter shaved a crucial few points off Clinton’s vote in the home stretch. But critics believe a better campaign would have left her less exposed to a last-minute surprise. If not for a series of miscalculations, these critics contend, the Comey letter wouldn’t have had the impact it did—and she might be president-elect today. Continue Reading Eric Thayer / Reuters An Unpredictable Upcoming Matchup: Donald Trump vs. Big Business Kevin Carty The president-elect may seem an unlikely trust-buster, but he’s indicated an openness to reviving America’s once-robust anti-monopoly apparatus. The election of Donald Trump has prompted many stories about how, or whether, he will roll back the policies that make up President Obama’s economic legacy, including the Affordable Care Act and 2010’s Dodd-Frank banking regulations. But one of the most important, if underappreciated, stories of the coming administration will be Trump’s approach toward big business and the system that regulates it: anti-monopoly policy. In the past year, via an executive order and several papers from the White House’s top economists, President Obama and his team began paving the way for tougher competition policy. His administration has blocked more mergers than administrations in the recent past, including successful challenges to such mammoth deals as GE and Electrolux, Comcast and Time Warner, and Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren and even Hillary Clinton (far from anyone’s idea of a trust-buster) came out in favor of more aggressive anti-monopoly policy, and the Democrats added an antitrust pledge to their party platform—a plank that had been absent since 1988. Continue Reading Oliver Munday China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows The country has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution. What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar. Continue Reading Regis Duvignau / Reuters Twitter's Misbegotten Censorship David Frum The right way to deal with social media’s neo-Nazis is not by taking away their platforms, but by taking away their audiences. The very last tweet from the now-suspended Twitter account of the alt-right leader Richard B. Spencer was directed at me. On Tuesday afternoon, I tweeted a link to a BuzzFeed report that Russia’s English-language channel, RT, was testing a new program featuring Katie Hopkins. (Hopkins, for those unfamiliar, is a provocative British media personality, perhaps best known for a TV interview in which she described judging her children’s playmates by whether their given names were posh enough.) Spencer retorted to my Hopkins tweet: “We’re winning. You’re losing.” My answer remains on my Twitter timeline as a punchline without a setup: “You’d have said that on the afternoon of the Guernica bombing too. Wasn’t true then; isn’t true now.” Minutes after that exchange, Spencer’s account vanished, as did that of his website, as well as nearly a dozen other people associated with Spencer's brand of racialist politics. All this on a day when Spencer had appeared on NPR and the Daily Show. Continue Reading Edmon de Haro What Obama Got Right Jonathan Rauch The outgoing president has resolved old problems and avoided new ones. In one respect, presidents are like kindergartners. Well, sometimes in more than one respect, depending on the president. That aside, presidents and kindergartners have in common that one of the simplest ways to evaluate them is also one of the best: Do they clean up when they’re finished? People who talk about presidential legacies typically have grandeur in mind. Did a president enact large new programs? Win a war? Forge a political realignment? Pass the torch to a new generation? End tyranny in the world? But the romantic ideal of the overachieving chief executive ignores the fact that presidents can much more easily do harm than good (another respect in which they resemble kindergartners). The world is full of traps and snares, and the presidency is surrounded by what the historian Gil Troy has called invisible trip wires, which are liable to snag presidents who overstep. Continue Reading Nathan Chute / Reuters Better Off Before Obamacare? Olga Khazan Before the law, which Trump has said he would repeal, health insurance was cheaper for a few, but outright unattainable for many. Throughout his campaign, President-Elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he called “a disaster.” That was music to his supporters’ ears. Repealing Obamacare is Republican voters’ biggest priority for the Trump administration, according to a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll. People who are unhappy with the Affordable Care Act overwhelmingly voted for Trump, and now 74 percent of Republicans want it gone. The frustration with the health law is understandable; many people are struggling to afford medical care even if they have insurance. The problem is, it’s not clear Americans would have been better off had Obamacare never been passed. First, some people might be confused about what, exactly, they’re angry at. When we talk about “Obamacare,” we’re talking primarily about the 12.7 million people who are buying individual insurance coverage through state marketplaces or Healthcare.gov. Roughly 60 million people voted for Trump last week, so they can’t all be on Obamacare exchange plans. More than half of all non-elderly Americans still get insurance through work, and premiums on employer-based plans are actually growing more slowly than average. (About a third of Americans are either on Medicare or Medicaid, and the rest are uninsured. Only about 4 percent are on the exchanges.) Continue Reading Neil Hall / Reuters A Post-Brexit Roadmap for Disaffected Clinton Voters Linda Kinstler Much of your country appears to reject your values. What do you do now? The morning after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the Remain campaign and the overwhelmingly young, urban liberals who championed its cause, awoke to the reality of bitter, unexpected defeat. Tammy Palmer, an activist who campaigned against Brexit, cried all the way to work. “By the time I got off the tube, I was like, right, screw it, I’m going to find an army, and I’m going to lead that army, and [Brexit] is not going to happen,” she said. People poured out onto the streets to protest the outcome, to march for Europe. Then, they started organizing. Emails with subject lines like “#GenerationFucked #SaveLondon #SaveBritain” circulated among young activists and writers, sketching out possible plans for action. Continue Reading Pascal Pochard-Casabianca / AFP / Getty Playing the Workaholic on Social Media Laur M. Jackson "Public displays of working" are part humblebrag, part cry for help. Though the sentiment “fuck my life,” expressed in some form or another, has existed as long as life has been terrible, the abbreviation “FML” is entirely an invention of the internet’s social age. While it’s hard to know from where it originally sprung, it was popularized via the website-or-blog-or-bulletin Fmylife.com. Fmylife.com was created in 2008 by Maxime Valette, Guillaume Passaglia, and Didier Guedjas as an English adaptation of their French Viedemerde.fr. Though the site began just as a work in translation, it quickly gained its own rightful traction and tons of submissions in English. It also set the grammatical terms of use for “FML” more generally. Fmylife.com depended on sharing and thrived on an economy of bad feelings: Users submitted their best (worst) tales of woe—always beginning with “Today,” always ending on “FML.” Other users then evaluated the stories by clicking either “I agree, your life sucks” or “You totally deserve it.” Continue Reading We're Probably Imagining Aliens Wrong Nadine Ajaka Why haven’t we found extraterrestrial life?

 Wherever you go online, someone is trying to personalize your web experience and that could be changing your identity Tanya Kant, The Conversation UK Sep. 9, 2016, 7:45 PM 1,686 facebook linkedin twitter email print Wherever you go online, someone is trying to personalise your web experience. Your preferences are pre-empted, your intentions and motivations predicted. That toaster you briefly glanced at three months ago keeps returning to haunt your browsing in tailored advertising sidebars. And it’s not a one-way street. In fact, the quite impersonal mechanics of some personalisation systems may not only influence how we see the world, but how we see ourselves. It happens every day, to all of us while we’re online. Facebook’s News Feed attempts to deliver tailored content that “most interests” individual users. Amazon’s recommendation engine uses personal data tracking combined with other users’ browsing habits to suggest relevant products. Google customises search results, and much more: for example, personalisation app Google Now seeks to “give you the information you need throughout your day, before you even ask”. Such personalisation systems don’t just aim to provide relevance to users; through targeted marketing strategies, they also generate profit for many free-to-use web services. Perhaps the best-known critique of this process is the “filter bubble” theory. Proposed by internet activist Eli Pariser, this theory suggests that personalisation can detrimentally affect web users’ experiences. Instead of being exposed to universal, diverse content, users are algorithmically delivered material that matches their pre-existing, self-affirming viewpoints. The filter bubble therefore poses a problem for democratic engagement: by restricting access to challenging and diverse points of view, users are unable to participate in collective and informed debate. Attempts to find evidence of the filter bubble have produced mixed results. Some studies have shown that personalisation can indeed lead to a “myopic” view of a topic; other studies have found that in different contexts, personalisation can actually help users discover common and diverse content. My research suggests that personalisation does not just affect how we see the world, but how we view ourselves. What’s more, the influence of personalisation on our identities may not be due to filter bubbles of consumption, but because in some instances online personalisation is not very “personal” at all. Data tracking and user pre-emption To understand this, it is useful to consider how online personalisation is achieved. Although personalisation systems track our individual web movements, they are not designed to “know” or identify us as individuals. Instead, these systems collate users’ real-time movements and habits into mass data sets, and look for patterns and correlations between users’ movements. The found patterns and correlations are then translated back into identity categories that we might recognise (such as age, gender, language and interests) and that we might fit into. By looking for mass patterns in order to deliver personally relevant content, personalisation is in fact based on a rather impersonal process. Reidar Hahn/Fermilab When the filter bubble theory first emerged in 2011, Pariser argued that one of the biggest problems with personalisation was that users did not know it was happening. Nowadays, despite objections to data tracking, many users are aware that they are being tracked in exchange for use of free services, and that this tracking is used for forms of personalisation. Far less clear, however, are the specifics of what is being personalised for us, how and when. Finding the ‘personal’ My research suggests that some users assume their experiences are being personalised to complex degrees. In an in-depth qualitative study of 36 web users, upon seeing advertising for weight loss products on Facebook some female users reported that they assumed that Facebook had profiled them as overweight or fitness-oriented. In fact, these weight loss ads were delivered generically to women aged 24-30. However, because users can be unaware of the impersonal nature of some personalisation systems, such targeted ads can have a detrimental impact on how these users view themselves: to put it crudely, they must be overweight, because Facebook tells them they are. It’s not just targeted advertising that can have this impact: in an ethnographic and longitudinal study conducted of a handful of 18 and 19-year-old Google Now users, I found that some participants assumed the app was capable of personalisation to an extraordinarily complex extent. Users reported that they believed Google Now showed them stocks information because Google knew their parents were stockholders, or that Google (wrongly) pre-empted a “commute” to “work” because participants had once lied about being over school age on their YouTube accounts. It goes without saying that this small-scale study does not represent the engagements of all Google Now users: but it does suggest that for these individuals, the predictive promises of Google Now were almost infallible. Screenshot In fact, critiques of user-centred design suggest that the reality of Google’s inferences is much more impersonal: Google Now assumes that its “ideal user” does – or at least should – have an interest in stocks, and that all users are workers who commute. Such critiques highlight that it is these assumptions which largely structure Google’s personalisation framework (for example through the app’s adherence to predefined “card” categories such as “Sports”, which during my study only allowed users to ‘follow’ men’s rather than women’s UK football clubs). However, rather than questioning the app’s assumptions, my study suggests that participants placed themselves outside the expected norm: they trusted Google to tell them what their personal experiences should look like. Though these might seem like extreme examples of impersonal algorithmic inference and user assumption, the fact that we cannot be sure what is being personalised, when or how are more common problems. To me, these user testimonies highlight that the tailoring of online content has implications beyond the fact that it might be detrimental for democracy. They suggest that unless we begin to understand that personalisation can at times operate via highly impersonal frameworks, we may be putting too much faith in personalisation to tell us how we should behave, and who we should be, rather than vice versa.

Her campaign, meanwhile, has cited “a host of uncontrollable headwinds,” asserting that her team did all they could in an unforeseeably difficult environment. Many Democrats, however, are less forgiving of the campaign and its strategy. It may be true that the Comey letter shaved a crucial few points off Clinton’s vote in the home stretch. But critics believe a better campaign would have left her less exposed to a last-minute surprise. If not for a series of miscalculations, these critics contend, the Comey letter wouldn’t have had the impact it did—and she might be president-elect today. Continue Reading Eric Thayer / Reuters An Unpredictable Upcoming Matchup: Donald Trump vs. Big Business Kevin Carty The president-elect may seem an unlikely trust-buster, but he’s indicated an openness to reviving America’s once-robust anti-monopoly apparatus. The election of Donald Trump has prompted many stories about how, or whether, he will roll back the policies that make up President Obama’s economic legacy, including the Affordable Care Act and 2010’s Dodd-Frank banking regulations. But one of the most important, if underappreciated, stories of the coming administration will be Trump’s approach toward big business and the system that regulates it: anti-monopoly policy. In the past year, via an executive order and several papers from the White House’s top economists, President Obama and his team began paving the way for tougher competition policy. His administration has blocked more mergers than administrations in the recent past, including successful challenges to such mammoth deals as GE and Electrolux, Comcast and Time Warner, and Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren and even Hillary Clinton (far from anyone’s idea of a trust-buster) came out in favor of more aggressive anti-monopoly policy, and the Democrats added an antitrust pledge to their party platform—a plank that had been absent since 1988. Continue Reading Oliver Munday China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows The country has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution. What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar. Continue Reading Regis Duvignau / Reuters Twitter's Misbegotten Censorship David Frum The right way to deal with social media’s neo-Nazis is not by taking away their platforms, but by taking away their audiences. The very last tweet from the now-suspended Twitter account of the alt-right leader Richard B. Spencer was directed at me. On Tuesday afternoon, I tweeted a link to a BuzzFeed report that Russia’s English-language channel, RT, was testing a new program featuring Katie Hopkins. (Hopkins, for those unfamiliar, is a provocative British media personality, perhaps best known for a TV interview in which she described judging her children’s playmates by whether their given names were posh enough.) Spencer retorted to my Hopkins tweet: “We’re winning. You’re losing.” My answer remains on my Twitter timeline as a punchline without a setup: “You’d have said that on the afternoon of the Guernica bombing too. Wasn’t true then; isn’t true now.” Minutes after that exchange, Spencer’s account vanished, as did that of his website, as well as nearly a dozen other people associated with Spencer's brand of racialist politics. All this on a day when Spencer had appeared on NPR and the Daily Show. Continue Reading Edmon de Haro What Obama Got Right Jonathan Rauch The outgoing president has resolved old problems and avoided new ones. In one respect, presidents are like kindergartners. Well, sometimes in more than one respect, depending on the president. That aside, presidents and kindergartners have in common that one of the simplest ways to evaluate them is also one of the best: Do they clean up when they’re finished? People who talk about presidential legacies typically have grandeur in mind. Did a president enact large new programs? Win a war? Forge a political realignment? Pass the torch to a new generation? End tyranny in the world? But the romantic ideal of the overachieving chief executive ignores the fact that presidents can much more easily do harm than good (another respect in which they resemble kindergartners). The world is full of traps and snares, and the presidency is surrounded by what the historian Gil Troy has called invisible trip wires, which are liable to snag presidents who overstep. Continue Reading Nathan Chute / Reuters Better Off Before Obamacare? Olga Khazan Before the law, which Trump has said he would repeal, health insurance was cheaper for a few, but outright unattainable for many. Throughout his campaign, President-Elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he called “a disaster.” That was music to his supporters’ ears. Repealing Obamacare is Republican voters’ biggest priority for the Trump administration, according to a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll. People who are unhappy with the Affordable Care Act overwhelmingly voted for Trump, and now 74 percent of Republicans want it gone. The frustration with the health law is understandable; many people are struggling to afford medical care even if they have insurance. The problem is, it’s not clear Americans would have been better off had Obamacare never been passed. First, some people might be confused about what, exactly, they’re angry at. When we talk about “Obamacare,” we’re talking primarily about the 12.7 million people who are buying individual insurance coverage through state marketplaces or Healthcare.gov. Roughly 60 million people voted for Trump last week, so they can’t all be on Obamacare exchange plans. More than half of all non-elderly Americans still get insurance through work, and premiums on employer-based plans are actually growing more slowly than average. (About a third of Americans are either on Medicare or Medicaid, and the rest are uninsured. Only about 4 percent are on the exchanges.) Continue Reading Neil Hall / Reuters A Post-Brexit Roadmap for Disaffected Clinton Voters Linda Kinstler Much of your country appears to reject your values. What do you do now? The morning after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the Remain campaign and the overwhelmingly young, urban liberals who championed its cause, awoke to the reality of bitter, unexpected defeat. Tammy Palmer, an activist who campaigned against Brexit, cried all the way to work. “By the time I got off the tube, I was like, right, screw it, I’m going to find an army, and I’m going to lead that army, and [Brexit] is not going to happen,” she said. People poured out onto the streets to protest the outcome, to march for Europe. Then, they started organizing. Emails with subject lines like “#GenerationFucked #SaveLondon #SaveBritain” circulated among young activists and writers, sketching out possible plans for action. Continue Reading Pascal Pochard-Casabianca / AFP / Getty Playing the Workaholic on Social Media Laur M. Jackson "Public displays of working" are part humblebrag, part cry for help. Though the sentiment “fuck my life,” expressed in some form or another, has existed as long as life has been terrible, the abbreviation “FML” is entirely an invention of the internet’s social age. While it’s hard to know from where it originally sprung, it was popularized via the website-or-blog-or-bulletin Fmylife.com. Fmylife.com was created in 2008 by Maxime Valette, Guillaume Passaglia, and Didier Guedjas as an English adaptation of their French Viedemerde.fr. Though the site began just as a work in translation, it quickly gained its own rightful traction and tons of submissions in English. It also set the grammatical terms of use for “FML” more generally. Fmylife.com depended on sharing and thrived on an economy of bad feelings: Users submitted their best (worst) tales of woe—always beginning with “Today,” always ending on “FML.” Other users then evaluated the stories by clicking either “I agree, your life sucks” or “You totally deserve it.” Continue Reading We're Probably Imagining Aliens Wrong Nadine Ajaka Why haven’t we found extraterrestrial life?

These photos were on the Camera Roll. How do we upload the ones that are just in Photos? — Susan McDonald Google Photos app settings on an iPhone 6. If you want your phone’s photos backed up to the cloud, make sure the “Back up & sync” feature is turned on. Tech+ If you’re ever wondering why an app doesn’t work, head to the settings. And for smartphones, there are two places to find an app’s settings. Start with the phone’s own settings. This area usually gives an app its permissions — let it track your location, access all your files or use cell data for uploads? In the iPhone’s case with the Google Photos app, here’s how to get there: Settings >> Google Photos. You’ll see three things Google Photos is asking for access to, including your phone’s “Photos.” Now go to the Google Photos app. Find the three horizontal lines at the top left and you’ll see “Settings.” In this case, you’ll want to make sure your “Back up & sync” settings are turned on. Feel free to explore the rest of the options to see if anything else is blocking Google Photos from accessing your iPhone’s “Photos.” If the process is unsatisfactory, your photos may not actually be on your phone. Apple iPhones store photos two ways — in Camera Roll and in My Photo Stream. Camera Roll refers to photos stored on the device. My Photo Stream are photos stored in the cloud and may actually be stored on other devices. If photos are in My Photo Stream, then they’re already backed up in a second location. Now, if you’re talking about older photos that are not on your phone but were backed up to a PC via iTunes, Google has a way to quickly copy those older photos to the cloud too. Download the Google Photos desktop uploader from photos.google.com/apps and it will lead you through the process of linking folders filled with old photos on your PC to the cloud. For readers who decide to stick with Apple’s own back-up service in its iCloud, you can make sure all old and new photos on the phone are getting backed up online. Just follow these steps: Settings >>Photos & Camera >>iCloud Photo library (the description says it all: “Automatically upload and store your entire library in iCloud to access photos and videos from all your devices.”) Keep in mind that auto backup means you may run out of the free 5 GBs of iCloud storage or the free 15 GBs on Google Drive. It’s easy to add more gigabytes but it’ll cost you — starting at 99 cents a month for 50 GB at Apple’s iCloud and $1.99 per month for 100 GBs at Google.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Web Google Finally Responds to Microsoft’s Chrome Complaints with Its Own Tests By Rafia Shaikh Posted 2 months ago 18Shares Share Tweet Submit Microsoft started a messy war earlier this year when it showed that Chrome was really bad for battery life and Edge was the cure for all browser-problems. Months have passed since the software giant posted the side-by-side comparison specifically hitting Chrome and Opera. Now, Google is finally ready to respond and has claimed that its browser is experiencing double-digit improvements in not only battery life but speed too when compared to last year. Chrome experiences double-digit battery life and speed improvements Responding to Microsoft’s tests conducted in June showing that Chrome is the most battery intensive browser on Windows 10, Google has now run similar tests. Chrome 53 that was released last week is shown in the latest tests, delivering 2 hours and 12 minutes of longer HD video playback when compared to version 46 from last October. Google has also used Surface Books in the new comparison video to show that its latest browser version is much improved than a year ago. Over the last year Chrome has seen double-digit improvements in speed and battery life. These improvements help you get more done, faster, and we thought you’d like an update. When measured with tools like Speedometer, improvements over the last year have made Chrome more than 15 percent faster on both desktop and Android. That’s good news if you’re working against a deadline or trying to place a last-minute order. Advertisement Google updated its browser for Windows with Material Design and battery improvements over the weekend. Latest video focuses on version 53 playing HTML5 video from Vimeo, Facebook and YouTube on Windows. The company had previously promised to bring battery life and performance improvements. With a focus on video playback, it isn’t certain if we will see similar improvements when browsing regular websites on Windows. As for the speed, Google has claimed that its browser on the desktop and Android is now 15% faster than it was a year ago. Not only Windows, Chrome for Mac also now uses 33% less power when viewing images or watching videos. While Google isn’t claiming if Chrome 53 resolves all the issues, it does seem to be finally taking care of the most critical problems that users face with the browser – battery life and speed.

Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, which started off strong, came across a huge obstacle once numerous reports of spontaneous combustion started rolling in. Although Samsung responded quickly (and appropriately) to the issue, they’ve undoubtedly taken a blow to their reputation. There’s also the iPhone 7, which featured a number of important upgrades, but is also under heavy scrutiny due to the removal of the standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The next “big” smartphone to make an appearance for our expected fall line-up is Google’s Nexus – or perhaps Google’s Pixel, as rumors would have us believe – which is predicted to make its official appearance sometime in early October. Here’s to hoping that Google’s release, whether it’s Nexus, Pixel, or otherwise, is a good one, because this year seems like easy money thanks to hiccups with the competition. However, it’s going to take more than riding off of competitor's issues to make this year successful for Google. Assuming that Google is retiring the Nexus name in favor of Pixel, the move could end up paying off better than initially expected. Aside from bringing a better sense of unity to Google’s mobile lineup (matching a Pixel-branded phone with its Pixel C tablet), if Google can up its marketing game, this could be the year that the phone formerly known as Nexus could really garner some attention. In the past, the Nexus wasn’t exactly well-known outside of tech enthusiast circles. Between lack of marketing and official carrier support (most of the time), if a general consumer didn’t know somebody that could point them in the direction of Nexus or use Google-fu to conduct smartphone research on their own, they probably had no idea that Nexus even existed. Lack of prior knowledge of the device is a big reason why I think this year is as good of a year as any to really push Nexus (or Pixel) forward – there are hardly any prejudices to be had against the Nexus, at least when you compare them to more recognizable smartphone brands. Although neither of the two expected Google phones have been officially announced, it’s expected that smartphone manufacturer HTC will be the company assisting Google in designing both, codenamed Sailfish and Marlin. HTC is the same company that made aluminum unibody design commonplace in the mobile industry with the introduction of the HTC One (M7) back in 2013. Since then, HTC has had ups and downs with its One line, but hardly due to its design. As an avid fan of HTC’s design in the One series, I suspect that Sailfish and Marlin could end up being considered two of the most well-designed Nexus devices ever created – which can only boost morale for the devices, as the look and feel of a smartphone is often extremely important to consumers. Ultimately, the potential for Google’s success is almost perfectly set up: recent competition isn't wholly at its best, the manufacturer behind both of Google’s smartphones’ designs has a high chance of producing something really premium, and Google as a company is this massive advertising giant that already has the means and resources to market the crap out of the Nexus/Pixel if they really wanted to. Assuming the phones have headphone jacks, don’t explode, don’t stray too far from stock Android (at the very least keeping a clean interface), and really just stay away from any other massive blunders, this could be a great year for Google. Only time will tell, but I for one am kind of on the edge of my seat waiting see if Google takes advantage of the situation and drives their smartphones home this year.

ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More The Cloud and Mobile Revolution: What’s Next? By Maja Tarateta Published September 07, 2016 Cloud Innovations FOXBusiness Facebook Twitter Comments Print When it comes to the Cloud, experts say, right now, it’s all about “magical convenience.” Continue Reading Below As in, making things happen just by asking, no matter where you are. “The big revolution is the growth of the Cloud and mobile,” said Evangelos Katsamakas, associate professor of information systems at Fordham University. “A smart phone is basically a computer. It’s like a remote control for the Cloud. You can request a taxi, share a photo or find directions. It’s a magical thing.” What has the Cloud done for you lately? Most likely, more than you realize. Sharing and Storing Photos Boxes of fading images, gathering dust in closets and desk drawers, unorganized, difficult to share with friends and family. These are the relics of photos past. Patrick Austin, associate editor, electronics, at Consumer Reports, cites photo storage and sharing as one of the top ways the Cloud has made life easier. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT “Google Drive, Dropbox, these are all easy ways to store photos, documents, videos, funny GIFs,” he said. “You can snap some photos and they go to Google Drive and you can share them with family and friends. No more going to develop film or burning CDs. Just give them a link.” The Cloud even makes it easier to find that “missing” photo that used to mean hours flipping through stacks of images. “Facial recognition with Google Photo [and iPhoto and others] lets you search for a picture by typing the name of the person,” said Giuseppe Ateniese, director of the computer science department at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. “This is machine learning from aggregated algorithms.” (Made possible by the Cloud.) Limitless Storage and Device Flexibility “Right now, we assume that we have unlimited storage — pictures, emails, files — all stored with no limitations,” said Ateniese. “We have unlimited storage that kids take for granted and everything — movies, music — all is immediately available on any computing device.” Once upon a time, a work computer was difficult (impossible?) to access from home. Many a heavy laptop was lugged on back-and-forth commutes so that work information could be accessed away from work. But with the Cloud, “You are no longer tied to a desk or a device,” said Austin. “And if you have an idea at home, you can just go into Dropbox or Google Docs” and immediately share it and have access to it on all your devices.” Shared “living” documents that multiple people can access and add to through the Cloud also improve work productivity and make lives easier. “We take for granted that all the information is synced among the different devices — laptops, cellphones, desktops,” said Ateniese. “Right now, we are using the Cloud mostly for storage and availability of data. But we should not forget that the Cloud is also about computation. The Cloud is a set of remote servers, and we can exploit the power of these servers.” Future Applications Today, tech companies are thinking way beyond these simple ways that the Cloud is improving lives, delving into deeper applications that involve concepts like predictive analytics, virtual reality and artificial intelligence to add to convenience and improve experience, based on aggregate data. “Health applications will probably be one of the most compelling future applications of the Cloud,” said Ateniese. “The Cloud will aggregate data from sensors in laptops and other devices to give a picture of the health of users. This will be extremely important in the future.” Streaming-video companies, like Netflix, will be able to anticipate what movie people will want to watch next on a much more accurate basis, and will suggest it, all by correlating data. “From a consumer perspective, we give up control for ease,” said Katsamakas, who cites artificial intelligence as a big theme going forward. “The Cloud is becoming smarter by itself over time.” “In some ways, there is added convenience,” he continued. “But big companies know everything about you, sometimes even better than you know yourself.” “People love the convenience,” agreed Austin, “until it gets creepy and people feel it is being used against them.” For now, he argues, “there’s not that much to worry about.” What do you think?

Ford CEO Mark Fields says they will move their production of the Ford Focus to Mexico to create room for "two very important products" coming to the Michigan factories. Fields states that this will not affect on jobs in Michigan what so ever. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized Ford for the decision to shift production to Mexico, and said he would consider levying tariffs on Mexican-made Fords.

The Venetians were impressed (they doubled Galileo’s salary and gave him lifetime tenure at the University of Padua) because they immediately saw the huge financial and military advantages offered by this visionary device. A few hundred years later, we are on the cusp of an equally radical transformation in how information is gathered, analyzed and monetized. And if we pay attention, we might even save the planet. The number of satellites orbiting Earth increased 40 percent in just the past five years, and those hunks of metal are snapping pictures at a mind-blowing rate. This explosion of images isn’t just the National Security Agency feverishly peeking into your bedroom and laptop; it’s a revolution that’s going to radically change how we respond to environmental disasters and run our farms. It’s also going to upend the stock market, because it’s turning the whole world into usable data, giving us a precise count of oil tankers in all the world’s ports and how many cars are in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Know that, and you can—like Galileo’s Venetian pals—make some very lucrative investments. That’s why dozens of companies are racing to get into orbit. Seattle-based BlackSky Global is planning to launch six spacecraft; Terra Bella, a Google-Alphabet subsidiary, has two satellites in orbit and promises video that can “see objects up to the size of a car,” while Spire owns 10 orbiting satellites and plans to take millions of pictures of the world’s oceans. These and other upstarts are chasing imaging giants like DigitalGlobe, Airbus and Rapid Eye, who have hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware floating miles above our heads. But no one has launched as fast and as often as Planet, a startup running out of an old gray warehouse in San Francisco’s Mission District. In a neighborhood filled mostly with vintage furniture stores, hip restaurants and coffee shops, Planet has 62 satellites in orbit, the world’s largest private collection, and by the end of the year it will have 100, enough that every nook, cranny and keyhole on Earth will get its own medium-resolution photo every single day. This avalanche of images will create an unprecedented database of the entire planet, one that can be used to stop forest fires and maybe even wars. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 8NEXT SLIDE > Daily photos covering the entire world could keep better track of wildfires, such as this one in Southern California photographed by a NASA satellite in 2007. (NASA) © Provided by IBT Media What Hath Smartphone Wrought? Nothing about launching a satellite is cheap or easy, but what if you could just hurl your iPhone into orbit? In 2010, two NASA Ames Research Center engineers, Will Marshall and Chris Boshuizen, basically did just that. They realized that the power of the phones in their pockets far outstripped anything in orbit in terms of computing power, and the tech underneath that glass screen has a lot of overlap with the nuts and bolts of most satellites. “You have to have power, batteries, GPS, a transmitter,” says Marshall, “all that was missing were solar panels to keep them charged and a system to orient it in space.” The duo went to Nevada’s Black Rock Desert and strapped a few smartphones onto amateur rockets to see if they could handle the g-force and vibrations of a launch. This seat-of-the-pants test wasn’t NASA-approved—“We hadn't really told anyone what we were doing,” Marshall says—but it was a success. The phones were able to handle the vibrations of a launch and the vacuum of space, so the engineers convinced NASA to try a bigger test. By late 2013, the agency was officially on board, putting them in charge of a mission to launch three modified Google Nexus 1 phones on a rocket to the International Space Station, where they were dropped into orbit. The phones flew around the globe, happily chirping back photos to be collected by amateur radio operators down on Earth. The final cost: just $3,500. The three tiny spaceships used for that mission—nicknamed Alexander, Graham and Bell—took very low-resolution, almost useless, images. But Boshuizen and Marshall, now working with NASA engineer Robbie Schingler, saw a huge opportunity: They wanted to make a space company (Planet) that moved like a tech company, upgrading its electronics constantly, like Apple does with the iPhone. Instead of planning a mission years out, as NASA does, Planet started building and launching cheap and fast—and just kept upgrading. Even after all their upgrades, Planet’s pictures won’t be the best on the market for resolution. You can see buildings, but details like cars are harder to make out. The stunning images available on Google Maps, for example, are much clearer, but that higher resolution requires bigger satellites, some the size of a bedroom, with lenses that have to be carefully aimed. That means they can only image a tiny part of the planet in a day. Planet doesn’t want to compete with these high-end images—it’s going for quantity. It just wants to slap a 3-foot telescope, some electric motors and solar panels to phone parts. Its satellites are cheap and small enough to cram into a nook on a rocket, allowing them to hitch on bigger space cargo trips, further reducing costs. The picture is just decent, but each photo-snapping satellite is so inexpensive that the company can line them up like pearls on a string high in the sky, running from the North Pole to South Pole, and create an extraordinarily rich database that will reveal how the Earth changes. Of course, those millions of images will be little more than a curiosity unless there’s a way to turn them into usable data. Not that long ago, getting a computer to recognize an image—a simple task for humans: Which of these 10 photos is one of Mom?—required supercomputers and algorithms written by entire university computer science departments, and even then the results were pretty fuzzy. Planet was lucky—it came along at just the right time to harness the power of one of the hottest fields in computer science: machine learning. Scientist have made huge gains with computers that act more like your brain—turn those computers loose on massive amounts of data, and they “learn” how to solve problems on their own. In 2012, Google coupled a neural network with a massive database built out of YouTube videos. Because it was YouTube, the computer eventually got pretty good at recognizing cats. Since then, machine learning has popped up in a lot of places online—it’s what lets Facebook match your friends to their faces when you upload photos, for instance. Computers have always been able to do things with numbers that humans never could; now they can do the same thing with images. That means you can point a computer to something in Planet’s archive of photos, like a baseball field, and then tell it to find and count every one on Earth. You could do the same for airfields in Europe or chemical plants in Africa. Planet could, according to one analyst, provide a daily count of every tree on the planet. Of course, there’s not a lot of money to be made counting trees—but somebody could get stupid-rich counting barrels of oil. Governments and commodity traders spend billions of dollars every year trying to get a handle on the oil industry, but the market is so wild that experts have called it broken or even rigged. Satellites offer a solution, because most oil is stored in giant cylinders. To keep explosive gas from building up in these big tanks, the lids float atop the oil, rising and falling as they get filled and emptied. Position a camera directly above one of those tanks, create a time-lapse video, you’d see a crescent shadow that would get slightly larger as the tank drained and the lid sank. A math whiz (or a computer) can then calculate how much oil is in that tank based on the time of day, the tank’s diameter and its shadows. It’s a neat trick people have been using for years—with the help of helicopter photos—to game the oil market. But with Planet’s images and machine learning, anyone could figure out how much oil is being stored all over the world (and place million-dollar bets accordingly). You could do the same with the number of shipping containers entering Seattle, or trucks parked at every manufacturing plant in China—data that could predict where key markets are headed. At least, that’s Orbital Insight’s business model. It is based on a quiet street that might house a tax preparer in most of the country, but in Palo Alto, California, it’s home to another space startup looking to change the world. Inside a nondescript, two-story office building, Orbital Insight’s founder, James Crawford—who worked in artificial intelligence and, with Google Books, helped digitize every page of every book in the world—calls up a graph that shows how many cars were spotted in all the parking lots of a major American clothing retailer (that he preferred not be named here) and the company’s income over the past five years. The two lines move in tandem through spikes and dips. In the latest quarter—a period for which the company has yet to report earnings—the cars-in-the-lot count looks pretty good. “We’re showing [the clothing retailer] slightly up,” Crawford says, “which is interesting because the market is showing them down.” You can almost hear a broker shouting, “Buy!” Tractors in Outer Space Most of Orbital Insight’s customers now are in finance, but the imagery revolution could have an even bigger impact in agriculture and, strangely, the quest for world peace. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has an annual budget of $180 million for data-crunching our food supplies, as well as a pretty good track record without using satellites: Its predictions on output are normally off by just 4 percent. But Descartes Labs, a satellite image analysis company, believes it has a new tool that can beat that. Most chlorophyll-filled plants, as you may remember from junior high biology, absorb the full spectrum of light except green, which gives them their tint. Chlorophyll also reflects near-infrared light, which is just outside the visible spectrum for humans, but by looking at infrared in a photo, you can get a pretty good look at the density of chlorophyll—high density is a sign of good plant health. Descartes can use chlorophyll density images, taken by satellites, to predict agricultural output. According to CEO Mark Johnson, the Descartes algorithm’s prediction of corn output was off by just 2.5 percent for the last 10 years. That may seem like news fit for Page 24 of a sleepy commodity markets publication, but poor food production predictions can lead to armed confrontations on a street near you. Wheat prices, for instance, spiked right before the Arab Spring, and a drought has been cited as one of causes of the French Revolution. “If you look at [the emergence of] Boko Haram and even ISIS, both were preceded by food shortages,” Johnson says. Descartes plans to move beyond corn to other crops and beyond the U.S. to make international estimates as well. But to do that, it needs images with a much higher resolution than what’s being shot now over rural areas. “Understanding activity in a field, differentiating between different types of crops—you can’t do that at low resolution,” Johnson says. That’s why Descartes is starting to use Planet’s images. Other companies are using satellites to maximize output on individual farms. For years, growers have tried to farm efficiently by applying different amounts of fertilizer to different parts of their land, depending on the soil type. That meant they had to divide the farm into a giant grid and test the soil type of each square. But with satellite images, a lot of that can be automated. A Canadian company called Farmers Edge can take the satellite image, run it through an algorithm and quickly figure out the soil makeup of each part of the field. The company sends signals directly to tractors that automatically apply the right type of fertilizer for each area. The process could save farmers money and get them to use less fertilizer, which will curb the runoff of nitrate into rivers. Cutting pollution is just one social benefit satellites will bring. “We finally have the tech to understand the planet as a living organism,” Johnson says. He sees Descartes’s mission as a “living analysis of the world, where we understand the resources we mine, grow and take out of the ground, and watch how we humans use them.” Execution by Anti-Aircraft Gun For most of history, humans had never seen a full picture of Earth. In the 1960s, as the space race heated up, a portrait that showed the whole planet became something of a holy grail. Former Merry Prankster and Whole Earth Catalog founder Stewart Brand started lobbying NASA to release an image of the planet in 1966. When the Apollo 17 crew returned with the Blue Marble image on December 7, 1972, Brand slapped it on the cover of his magazine and expected human consciousness to blossom. It did, sort of: There was something about seeing ourselves suspended in the blackness of space. Having a picture of our planet that changes with time could fundamentally alter how we think about ourselves and our environment. And it could change how we act, and react to disasters. On April 14, 2016, just weeks away from the presidential election of Peru, the front page of the most influential newspaper in the country ran two images taken by DigitalGlobe. The first, from November 2015, showed the rainforest verdant and full, broken only by a muddy lake. The second was taken in April 2016 and showed the same stretch of forest torn open, the lake bigger and, most critically, man-made structures spreading like the tendrils of a tumor. It was proof of “deforestation caused by gold seekers in the Tambopata Reserve,” the front page read. The photos sparked a national debate about illegal mining in the jungle that became a large part of the presidential election. Those images were discovered and released by the Amazon Conservation Association, a group with people on the ground in parts of the Andean Amazon disappearing the fastest, as well as a team of satellite analysts working in Washington, D.C. Matt Fine, a research specialist with the ACA, gets alerts from a University of Maryland program that automatically scans the forest and flags new signs of deforestation using NASA’s Landsat images. The two Landsat spacecraft take pictures of the whole planet, but the photos are low-resolution and updated only every 16 days. “You can confirm or deny deforestation is happening, but you can't see the forest,” Finer says. “It doesn’t really pull at your heartstrings too much.” But once he gets a Landsat image alert, Finer can track down better and more up-to-date images from Planet that show changes almost as they happen, and at a resolution where the changes in the twists of a river, for instance, are visible. It used to take months to find a story of environmental degradation; it now takes days, and activists can rally policymakers and voters in time to make a difference. Other companies are using satellite images to protect cultural landmarks or hapless citizens under the boot of a demonic despot. AllSource Analysis, based in Longmont, Colorado, uses the photos to tell stories about “places that are too hard, too dangerous or too remote to travel to,” for governments, nongovernmental organizations and commercial groups, according to Stephen Wood, the company’s CEO. For example, AllSource tracked the destruction of Iraq’s oldest Christian monastery by the Islamic State group (ISIS) and saw North Korea using anti-aircraft guns in executions. When a tsunami smashed into Japan in 2011, the AllSource team stayed up through the night to aid search-and-rescue efforts and then monitored a full-on nuclear meltdown at a huge power plant. “We were watching Fukushima as it was going through these changes, including blowing up a few times, and we’re one of the few people in the world seeing this,” Wood says. “We would see these villages, beautiful fishing villages, right after the tsunami had come through…just complete and utter devastation.” Planet’s Marshall says they were able to find an entire village that had vanished in a mudslide after Nepal’s quake in 2015. No one would have known to send help if someone hadn’t compared before and after images. Search-and-rescue missions and rapid disaster response are two areas where a regularly updated visual database of the full planet can save lives and even the planet. Black Boxes and John Prine It’s hard not to bang your head on low-hanging puns at Planet’s headquarters—work jargon like space and launch have much bigger import here. The employees make the most of the fact that they all work “in” space—they refer to themselves as “planeteers” and celebrate “flight-suit Friday’s.” (The flight suits aren’t company-issue, but there are quite a few to pick from on Etsy, an employee tells me.) At first glance, it looks like the office of a generic tech company—there’s a giant rack of bikes, a tasteful cafeteria with exposed brick, fridges stocked with coconut water, a sound system playing John Prine and the Kinks. It moves like a tech company too. Planet created 13 versions of its satellites in just over three years, a rate of iteration even Steve Jobs would have envied. But there are plenty of signs that Planet is working on something bigger than an Uber for ice cream. Just off the cafeteria is a door leading to its clean room, where engineers are assembling the delicate electronic innards for the company’s main product: satellites. A left turn brings you to a padded black box, an “anechoic chamber” that blocks radio signals so engineers can test radios without interference from cellphones or TV stations. Upstairs are rows of desks and blackboards scribbled with what looks to me like some dauntingly serious math. There’s also a giant wall of screens—kind of like what you see in photos of NASA’s command and control center—that tracks the movement of each of the company’s satellites, tracing parabolas over the planet, constantly snapping photos as they go. They’ve launched enough satellites that they’re beyond champagne celebrations. Eight went up in the week before my visit in early summer. Each Planet satellite is a work of art, in part because an artist adds swirling designs and a touch of individuality to each. But the extra care doesn’t mean they’re going to last. All orbiting satellites are always falling, losing a tiny amount of speed and altitude with each trip around Earth. Bigger, more expensive satellites push themselves back up with small thrusters, but Planet allows its satellites to drop. After about two years of going around and around, they re-enter the atmosphere and briefly turn into a shooting star as they burn up. Planet has launched 133, and 51 are still operational. I’m not good at math, but I know that’s a lot of shooting stars. Counting trees or even oil tanks doesn’t sound sexy, and it may not even be important if you’re not an investor or a tree hugger, but this technology is going to snake into every byway and back alley on Earth, and show us things we want to see, along with many things we didn’t know we needed to see. Back at that big wall of monitors, a “planeteer” pulls up an image from Aleppo, Syria. It’s not supercrisp, like what you get from Google Earth, but I can make out what’s going on down there—I can see berms being built. Someone explains to me that people are frantically digging earthen barriers to protect their homes and their families from suicide car bombers. And I suddenly feel horror, fear and guilt. It’s a tiny detail from a vast panoply of human endeavors, one that the curve of the Earth normally obscures from us, but for a minute it makes that war on the other side of the planet feel a little closer and stopping it a lot more urgent.

The stars were Andy Lewis in the ParaTriathlon, then Hannah Cockroft - of course - who eased home in the T34 100m Final ahead of another Brit, 15-year-old Kare Adenegan, and finally Kadeena Cox, who became the first Briton in 28 years to win medals in two sports at the same Paralympic Games. Below’s a video of that truly special achievement.

PHOTO| COURTESY  In Summary Communicating through messages on social media might seem like a time-wasting activity, but one Nairobi resident has learnt how to make money out of it. Mr Seth Kariuki, 36, sells land, cars, branding services among other items by sending direct messages to Facebook and Twitter users. For the last three years, Mr Kariuki has been a regular fixture in inboxes of some users as he looks for buyers. Advertisement By ELVIS ONDIEKI More by this Author By VINCENT ACHUKA More by this Author Nothing is permanent except change, so goes the saying. And change has been the constant in the careers arena over the years, with some jobs emerging every day while others fade into extinction. As the latest technological innovations spread in Kenya, careers pegged on the Internet are gaining prominence while those like being a switchboard operator, typist and video store clerks head for the back seat. Tasks that previously seemed like a pastime are now turning into full-time careers, with some organisations creating spaces for positions like social media marketers, online customer care agents and YouTubers among others. Dr Mike Iravo, a human resource lecturer at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, advises Kenyan employers to develop strategies to adapt to the change while minding the welfare of employees whose roles become redundant. “You can’t just start (phasing them out) all of a sudden. Let us go slowly as we phase them out. As we retire them, we then insist on people who should have these technology skills,” he told Lifestyle. Dr Iravo said that the new posts in the workplace are inevitable, especially with the onset of social media. “The way the world is going, we need to embrace the social media, although this can be preserved within time so that everybody comes on board,” he said. TIMELY DELIVERY On the advantages of social media to businesses, Dr Iravo said: “I see a lot of strategies being created for organisations through the employees. I see a lot of information being delivered on time. I see the exchange of skills between employees and others being enhanced.” According to Mr Justin Anyona, an agency relationship manager at Google Kenya, the expanding digital space is guaranteed to create more jobs with time. One of the spaces is YouTube, a platform for sharing videos. “It’s phenomenal. Look at youngsters of 13 to 18; the sort of content they watch. YouTube has really taken off. And there are all these sorts of YouTube stars, people who only log on to YouTube and they become huge. Some are even bigger than TV stars,” said Mr Anyona. “It’s quite big and it’s just about doing interesting content, getting subscribers, getting people to view your videos, and then now you work with Google and YouTube to monetise the content.” Another platform for making money, he said, is by helping websites rank higher on search results from search engines. “Some agencies … make for you websites and then they also offer an extra service of making sure that it’s properly optimised for search engines,” he said. Lifestyle looks into some of the jobs that have emerged in Kenya due to technological advancement, as told through youths who took a leap of faith and are now making money out of it. 1. SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETER Communicating through messages on social media might seem like a time-wasting activity, but one Nairobi resident has learnt how to make money out of it. Mr Seth Kariuki, 36, sells land, cars, branding services among other items by sending direct messages to Facebook and Twitter users. For the last three years, Mr Kariuki has been a regular fixture in inboxes of some users as he looks for buyers. He markets products belonging to other proprietors and gets a commission per sale. When he spoke to Lifestyle, he was looking for land for an energy company that wanted prime plots countrywide. He was also chasing a branding deal with a coffee shop. “You have to look for clients online through their Facebook pages, and their links. I also network a lot with people,” says the former banker. “I inbox, I ask for the numbers of a person I can talk to.” He runs at least four Facebook accounts through which he reaches potential buyers. To achieve that, he has adopted software that sends daily messages to Facebook users.  While social media marketing takes many perspectives, Mr Kariuki says his model works for him because it is cost-effective. “It is easy. You can work from anywhere: from office, from the house, provided you have Internet,” says the father of one. He says he makes enough to sustain his family, noting that if one works hard, one will not regret. “What you need to do is know the people you work with and to know what you’re selling,” he says. Going through one of his Facebook accounts, one realises that some of the posts are jokes that don’t relate to business in any way. “You have to be alive. You don’t have to be serious every time. There is need for humour,” he says. 2. VLOGGER Video blogging, or vlogging in short, is what Mr Wilson Muirania, popularly known as Jaymo Ule Msee, identifies as his launch pad to success. You might have seen him on KCB Bank advertisements for their new app or on the Jaymo Ule Msee show on TV. Before the fame, Mr Muirania was a bank relationship officer after graduating with a degree in Political Science and Economics from the University of Nairobi in 2008. But that didn’t excite him. “When I told my parents and friends that I had quit, they were puzzled and thought it was the wrong move, but I knew what I wanted,” he says. In theory, anyone with a camera, an Internet connection and something to say can create a video blog. But for him, vlogging is a career. His YouTube page has over two million views and his Facebook page had 172,244 followers by Friday. It is through these platforms that he broadcasts short videos that tell stories about every day life in a hilarious way. “Social media provides a space for everyone to experiment or do things that we feared doing before,” he says. “For me, using social media to market my talent was, and is, my strategy.” Other famous vloggers include Uganda’s Anne Kansiime who also ended up having a show on TV after her satirical videos impressed media houses. Although vlogging is making its baby steps in Kenya, in Western countries it has become a full-time career for some. According to Forbes, Swedish comedian Felix Kjellberg alias PewDiePie, who made a name from uploading YouTube videos of himself playing video games, earned $7.4 million (Sh740 million) last year from product endorsements. 3. DIGITAL STRATEGIST If you thought the people who set trends on Twitter and have tens of thousands of followers are idlers, better think again because some youths have flown to riches through that medium. One of those is Mr Rama Oluoch, known as Ramzzy on Twitter, currently working as a creative digital strategist at a Nairobi-based marketing firm — his third employer since 2011. With more than 48,600 “followers” on Twitter, Mr Oluoch has been involved in online campaigns for a number of products including beer brands, telecommunication companies and insurance firms. “When someone is launching a product or when there is somebody who already has a product and they’re looking for a professional, that’s when I get to talk to people,” he says. Mr Oluoch considers himself a creative person, an attribute he says has helped him prosper, in addition to his training as a graphic designer. “It’s a rewarding job. I say if you chase happiness, money will come. I chase happiness,” he says. The setback is that many people don’t still understand what he does. “You look unemployed most of the time,” he says, laughing. “You just stay online and you look like a ‘hustler’. Many don’t understand because it is a very young industry.” To succeed in the field, he says, one needs to be interesting and needs to have a considerable following on social media. “When you can grow yourself as a person online, it’s much easier for you to grow a brand because you understand how to communicate with people,” he says. 4. SEO CONSULTANT Do you know why one website appears before another whenever you key in some words on a search engine? A lot of things go into determining which site gets listed first, and you can earn a pretty penny advising website owners on how to make their portals rank higher than their competitors. The method of increasing a website’s reputation on search engines is called Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and it has provided employment opportunities in the last few years. Mr Ken Kariuki, who runs SEO Consulting Kenya, says he can never return to formal employment since he quit his job at a Nairobi-based technology company seven years ago. When a client hires his company, they analyse the components of the customer’s website to check if it meets Google’s requirements. If met, the website is likely to be ranked higher. “To put it in layman’s terms, Google has a sort of a checklist that they use ... They have got a running algorithm which they keep changing every other day,” he says. Throughout the years he has been engaging in SEO, he has served at least 60 clients. Every contract lasts a minimum of three months. Mr Kariuki says he was the one who created the Administration Police website and its social media outlets. “I was with them for about three years. Now they’re good enough to run it by themselves,” he says. To those aspiring to join his field, he says: “First, get the necessary skills and experience ... SEO is about experience. It’s not as easy as people say.” However, according to Mr Anyona, the Google relationship manager, some practitioners in the SEO field trick customers that they can improve the rank of their websites but flout Google rules in the process. “We’re very open about what goes into [ranking search results] … But there are also those sort of black-hat SEO experts … who try all these dirty tactics of trying to fool Google into ranking the page higher,” Mr Anyona says. 5. VIRTUAL ASSISTANT How about clicking that button to hire a personal assistant who will sort all your stuff for the day? If you think that is impossible, Mr Duncan Kipng’eno will tell you it is possible. He is the founder of Virtual Assistant Kenya, a company that helps people in need of an extra hand in creating a website, preparing account statements, graphic designing, personal assistant services, running errands among others. “You can hire a virtual assistant as your personal assistant. If you’re very busy as a manager, you can say, ‘Let me hire a PA who I can use to help me arrange for meetings, booking appointments and doing some shopping’,” he says. He started his company in April 2013 and since then he has offered virtual assistance to a number of clients worldwide. He currently has 11 people working under him and who specialise in various fields to meet clients’ diverse needs. “We have work from within the country and from other parts of the world — like we’ve had clients from US, UK, China,” he says. Mr Kipng’eno predicts that the demand for virtual assistants in Kenya will keep rising, given the cost-effectiveness the model offers small businesses. “We give small and medium-sized enterprises an opportunity to get the skills and to get services that could have otherwise been provided by employees at an affordable price and in an efficient way,” he says. Clients are charged differently for the services they seek from Mr Kipng’eno’s firm. “We charge Sh300 to Sh500 per hour depending on the task,” he says. 6. BLOGGER Blogging was non-existent in Kenya as recently as 10 years ago. But it has turned out to be one of the most sought-after careers with political parties, corporates and even the government turning to bloggers whenever they want to get a message out. In one of her posts where she replies a follower on what someone needs to do to become a fashion blogger, Silvia Njoki urges commitment. “Fashion blogging can be a full-time job or a hobby. So, depending on your vision, make sure you are committed to spend a lot of time and effort to produce the best possible content for your blog because passion should be your driving force,” she says. One of the ways bloggers make money is by allowing Google to place advertisements on their sites. They get paid when readers click on the ads. To become successful, Ms Njoki says you have to research and be knowledgeable so that people have a reason to visit your blog. Some of Kenya’s renowned bloggers include Sharon Mundia who runs This is Ess, Magunga Williams who runs This is Magunga and Sylvia Jemutai with Dine With Jemutai. 7. YOUTUBER Until you understand the art of running a channel on popular video website YouTube, you may not consider “YouTuber” as one of the emerging professions. But when make-up artist Kangai Mwiti explains how it has enabled her go places and reap profits, it starts to make sense. She started her YouTube channel Kangai Mwiti in May 2012 and by Friday, it had more than 96,300 subscribers, most of whom are there to learn how to apply makeup. “It took me eight months to get to 100 subscribers,” recalls Ms Mwiti, a graduate of international business and marketing from the United States International University. Ms Mwiti won hearts gradually, giving her channel the traction that opened doors for income when she became a brand. “It has expanded the work that I do to include so many other things apart from makeup,” she says. Now she has integrated the channel with social media platforms, which ensures a steady supply of clients in need of makeup. “Eighty per cent of my clients come from what they have seen online first then the others possibly come from referrals,” she says. She has lost count of the number of clients she has had ever since she gained fame online. “I have so many brides that I work with, I have makeover clients, I have corporates … For example, from July to August I’ve worked with an average of three to four weddings every week,” she says. For aspiring YouTubers, she urges persistence, consistency and creativity. 8. ONLINE SUPPORT CHAMPION Consumers now have the social media as the go-to place whenever they have complaints against sellers, and corporates are now employing people to enable them interact with clients. Ms Njeri Igane, for instance, works as an online support champion with Safaricom. When she reports for work in her 4 pm to 1 am shift, she checks which skill set she has been assigned for the day — mostly Facebook or Twitter — then responds to questions from subscribers. Sometimes she calls the customers. The number of queries they receive on online platforms, she says, is almost similar to those from direct callers. “On the weekends, it tends to die down because a lot of people who engage us on social media are the youths … so we have even less numbers of agents working over the weekend compared to the rest of the week,” she says. 9. APP DEVELOPER One-and-a-half decades after the cell phone came to Kenya, 85 per cent of the population now owns phones, according to the Communications Authority.  More recently, smartphones have gained prominence, creating an avenue for mobile application developers to create Kenyan-made apps, some of which have ended up being viable businesses. Entertainment applications have in particular become a hit, with developers creating apps like Tough Jungle, a gaming application created by Gerald Kibugi about a Maasai warrior who faces challenges in a forest. “At the time I came up with Tough Jungle, I realised that there have been no games based on the Kenyan setting apart from Ma3 Racer,” he says. Ma3 Racer, an app about driving a matatu on the streets of Nairobi, is perhaps the most successful — with over two million downloads. The phenomenal growth of this industry is the reason why Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s first stop in his recent Kenya visit was at iHub along Ngong Road, an incubation centre where app developers are guided to make money from their creations. 10. 3D SCULPTOR Also known as addictive manufacturing, 3D printing enables one to design and synthesise a three-dimensional object through a computer. Tangible objects of any shape or geometry can be produced by using Computer Aided Design software and although the adoption of this technology has been slow in Kenya, a number of 3D sculptors have sprung up. In 2013, Roy Ombati and Harris Nyali from the University of Nairobi, took part in the Innovation Africa competition on 3D printing through their project “Happy Feet” that aimed to assist people whose feet have been infested by jiggers with customized 3D printed shoes. It’s not just shoes, 3D printing can be applied in architecture, construction, industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military, engineering, medicine, biotechnology, fashion, education, geographic information systems and food industries.     email print In the headlines Race for IEBC top job narrows down to five - VIDEO The panel has the delicate task of negotiating the tricky political and ethnic lines in its Investigators put on the spot in NYS scam Tobiko, anti-graft team and criminal investigator under fire for shoddy probe on loss of funds.

Is Google gearing up for a clash with ride-hailing giant Uber? It may be, according to a Wall Street Journal report this past week. The Journal reported that Google has begun rolling out a service that offers an alternative to Uber's ride-hailing—without the need for dedicated professional drivers.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Google, a unit of Alphabet, has been running a pilot program since May that allows some users of its Waze route-planning app to connect with fellow commuters to share rides. Right now, the pilot program is limited to employees at a few companies in Silicon Valley, but Google plans to open the program to all San Francisco-area users of the Waze app this fall, according to the report.  Google may have plans to undercut Uber with its Waze route-planning app. Reuters While riders are paying fares, and drivers are being paid, the structure of the pilot program seems intended to discourage people from operating as full-time drivers, as they would with Uber or rival Lyft. The idea is that Waze will connect riders with drivers who are already headed in the same direction, making it simple for the driver to take them along. Riders are limited to two rides a day—to work and back, ideally.  Under the pilot program, riders pay no more than $0.54 cents a mile. It's probably no coincidence that's the Internal Revenue Service's current standard mileage allowance rate. The idea seems to be to give drivers a small cash incentive to pick up passengers, without asking them to go far out of their way to do so.  What does this program tell us about Google's likely plans? And what does it mean for Uber?   At least at the moment, Waze-enabled ride-sharing doesn't seem likely to put a big dent in Uber, even if it's rolled out to all Waze users across the country. Waze (and this new service) are structured around commuting, rather than the taxi-like short urban hops that are Uber's bread and butter.  Related Stories Waze Misleads IDF Troops to Clashes at Palestinian Camp Uber Plans to Launch Self-Driving Cars ‘Within Weeks’ Uber Plans to Map the World But it's another signal that Google is feeling its way into the business of personal mobility. Google has been working for years on a self-driving system for cars, but more recently seemed to have ruled out the idea of manufacturing cars itself. That left the obvious question—how would Google monetize its investment in self-driving technology?—with a somewhat obvious answer: By horning in on Uber's turf, somehow. This seems likely to be a move in that direction. Adding to the intrigue: Google Ventures was an early investor in Uber, but its board representative, Alphabet executive David Drummond, recently resigned from Uber's board.  If automated ride-hailing services take off as some analysts predict, Google seems well positioned to end up as a dominant player—if it decides to make the commitment to become one. That would put it in direct competition with Uber, a possibility that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has seen coming for a while. He told Bloomberg last month that worries about Google emerging as a competitor (rather than an ally) were what drove his decision to invest in a separate self-driving research program.  Who will prevail if the two end up battling? On the one hand, Google has Alphabet's massive corporate scale and resources, though it's not clear that Alphabet will be willing to spend on the scale that would be needed to buy (or build) and equip thousands of self-driving cars.  On the other hand, Uber has a big head start on addressing the extremely complicated software problem of routing its cars most efficiently. That's perhaps its most valuable advantage.  Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read © 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid email About Us Corrections Contact Us IBT Media Careers Advertise Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Archive Recent Issues Subscribe November 11 Issue Budweiser's Battle for Beer Market Dominance The Hacker’s Pearl Harbor The Cow Defense October 28 Issue Colorado Springs Teens Keep Killing Themselves Experts Suspect New Dead Sea Scroll Fragments Are Fake Donald the Destroyer October 21 Issue Swipe for Safer Sex Roosh V: From Pickup Artist to Right-Wing Provocateur The New ISIS Crisis October 14 Issue How the Chicago Marathon Will Keep Track of Millions The Black Panthers, 50 Years Later Trump Foundation Ordered to Halt Fundraising Browse Archives

In an attempt to change this, Google has released the Pixel C tablet (along with a choice of expensive keyboard covers), which it hopes will paint the Android tablet experience in a whole new light. But are they successful in this, or is the whole idea just academic in a world with affordable Windows 10 tablets Acer Switch Alpha 12 Hybrid Tablet Review and Giveaway Acer Switch Alpha 12 Hybrid Tablet Review and Giveaway Looking for a better priced Surface Pro 4?

It’s currently available for $499 directly from Google (plus another $150 for the keyboard), but you can win one in today’s competition! Google Pixel C Giveaway Me and the Android Tablet I’m proud to report that the Android tablet scene was one of the few times I’ve ever had my finger on the pulse (I don’t count using a smartphone from 2003-2008 because, well, it was a Windows Mobile device). Back in 2010, when the first Android tablets were released, I headed to my local electronics store and bought an Advent Vega tablet (also known as the P10AN01), rooted it, and discarded the version of Froyo that game pre-installed. I then installed a custom Android Honeycomb ROM called VegaComb. Ads by Google Despite the low cost of the device, it was reasonably good, but struggled with certain tasks (such as audio processing), where the iPad would shine. This was partly down to the operating system, as well as the architecture. But why do I mention the Advent Vega in particular? Well, it’s because the processor on that device was a dual core Tegra 2. The Pixel C also features a Tegra processor, this time the octa-core Tegra X1. But how does this measure up? Pixel C Hardware Specifications Six years is a long time in technology. Google’s Pixel C tablet takes a powerful Tegra X1 system-on-chip processor with 3 GB of RAM (32 GB or 64 GB of non-expandable storage is included, depending on the price point) and produces what is perhaps the best Tegra-powered tablet outside of NVidia’s gamer-centric Shield range NVIDIA Shield TV Review and Giveaway NVIDIA Shield TV Review and Giveaway The proposition is simple: Pack some of today’s best performing mobile hardware into a sandwich shaped box – for streaming video and media, and playing mobile games. That’s why you need to pay $200-300. Read More . The processor uses the curiously named ARM big.LITTLE architecture, which means that four of the eight cores are slower and power efficient, while the other four are faster and more powerful. This allows for more efficient battery usage when performing simple tasks like web browsing, with the ability to ramp up for more demanding task like gaming. The 10.2 inch, backlit LTPS IPS LCD display, runs at 308 ppi (density 2560 x 1800), and is powered by the 256-core Maxwell GPU. Weighing in at 18.2 oz (517 g), the 9.53 x 7.05 x 0.28-inch (242x179x7 mm device sits comfortably in the hand in either orientation, and the narrow bezel enhances the idea of the tablet as an iPad-beater. Over time it can be tricky to hold, however, partly due to the sleek quality of the build. The Pixel C comes with all of the usual cameras (8 MP rear, 2 MP front), audio (3.5 mm combo headphone/microphone jack, dual side-facing speakers) and connectivity options (WiFi, Bluetooth). NFC is conspicuous by its absence, as is a 4G variant of the Pixel C, which would no doubt see the tablet do well with the mobile networks. Where Is the Pixel C? This does seem to be a bit of a problem for Google’s flagship Android tablet, the successor to the Nexus tablets, at least for now. Unless you’re buying online from Google Play or Amazon, or from big name retailers, you’re not going to see much of it. Similarly, it has been largely absent from TV and magazine advertising, a sure-fire means of getting your product seen. Given the sheer chasm in quality and performance between the Pixel C and tablets from rival Samsung, this is lunacy. But most importantly, I feel, is the lack of partner deals with smartphone retailers. A 4G version of the Pixel C was touted early on, but this has failed to materialize. Is it a Tablet, a Laptop, or a “Laplet”? Yes, I really did just say “laplet” — it’s a terrible concatenation of “laptop” and “tablet” — and while it tries desperately to describe a device like the Pixel C (or perhaps Microsoft Surface Pro 4, or Apple iPad Pro) all it does really is trivialize the fact that this is a powerful, versatile tablet. The Google Pixel C is not a laplet. Not really. It most certainly isn’t a laptop — it feels and operates like a tablet. It doesn’t come with a mouse or touchpad (although Bluetooth devices can be added 6 Top Uses For Bluetooth On Your Android Phone 6 Top Uses For Bluetooth On Your Android Phone Bluetooth has been an impressive wireless technology to enable all sorts of cool functionality with multiple gadgets.

None of the things you would expect from a laptop are included, and placing the device on your actual lap is clumsy and unwieldy. So the Google Pixel C is definitely a tablet. But how is it to use? The Pixel C Keyboard Both of Google’s approved keyboard options for the Pixel C will set you back over $100. The one we’re featuring in this review and giveaway is a folio option that features a useful magnetic strip to keep the tablet in place. While there’s no “choose your own angle” adjustable stand as with the Surface Pro 4, it does offer two viewing angles, which is obviously better than just one. This keyboard will wrap around behind the Pixel C to allow its use in portrait mode, and actually makes the tablet easier to hold. I’d like to say that the keyboard is good enough for me to have written this entire review on. But circumstances happen; as a result, some of it was written on the Google Pixel C (along with several other complete posts, such as my look at Android Trojan infections How to Avoid Downloading Trojans to Your Android Device How to Avoid Downloading Trojans to Your Android Device Trojan attacks are sneaky because they can steal your personal details and sensitive data without you even realizing it. Here's how to avoid Trojan infections on Android devices. Read More ). If you’re buying a Pixel C, you may prefer to buy the tablet and couple it with your own Bluetooth keyboard. Whatever your solution, we’d recommend some sort of folio case regardless, as the Pixel C isn’t easy to grip. Working With the Google Pixel C One of the key selling points for the Google Pixel C is that it is a production tablet. Attach a keyboard it really does work like a compact ultrabook, much like Apple’s iPad Pro Powerful Things, Small Packages: iPad Pro 9.7" Review Powerful Things, Small Packages: iPad Pro 9.7" Review For some people, a 12.9" screen is the main draw of Apple's first iPad Pro.

We've got your back. Read More , it’s bound to deliver even more of a productive desktop experience. But, as you should be aware, so many creative and productive apps are now available for Android. A device like the Pixel C is perfect for taking advantage of these tools and getting down to business. An Expensive Kindle Replacement? Of course, all of this depends really on what sort of experience you want from your Android tablet. For instance, I usually use a Samsung 10-inch tablet, but even with a custom ROM installed this is a clunky experience, best for enjoying things like Comixology, Readly and Kindle, rather than doing any real work. If this is how you typically use a tablet, you might find that the Pixel C is a slightly expensive option. After all, these apps are available and run sufficiently well on nearly any device you can get hold of these days. Spending the best part of $600 on Google’s flagship tablet and accompanying keyboard, simply to enjoy the same reading experience with a slightly better display, seems excessive. On the other hand, if you want to read and research as well as be productive, the Pixel C is perfect. Consuming and Producing Multimedia Photo editing, video editing, even podcasting, are all tasks you can perform on the Pixel C. While this is not unusual for Android devices these days, the processor and RAM make these activities particularly slick and enjoyable, without the typical lag associated with older devices and Android versions. Enjoying games, photos, streamed video and music and any other content you can think of is similarly impressive. The color reproduction of the 10.2-inch LCD display is superb, with a richness to games and videos, a crispness to photos. In short, the Pixel C brings iPad-levels of competence to mobile media production and enjoyment. This is a significant step in the story of Android; it’s taken a while to reach this point, but we’re finally there, suggesting that replacing desktop and laptop computers with Android devices seems increasingly likely. It also means… Android’s iPad Killer Has Finally Arrived! While it’s a little heavier than an iPad, the Pixel C feels a little more businesslike, and it certainly has the muscle to provide all but the most ardent power users with all of the tools they need to get the job done. I’ll be honest: I’ve been evaluating this tablet for two months now. It is simply the best I’ve used of this type of device, and I’m very sad to see the back of it.

Forget every Android and iOS tablet you’ve used before, ignore all of the competition, and buy this. Especially if it is ever available from a mobile network! Our verdict of the Google Pixel C Tablet & Keyboard: The Pixel C is for professionals, and finally brings Android in sight of overcoming its mobile and desktop rivals.910 Previous PostHow to Stop Checking Your Phone by Replacing It With Your ComputerNext PostHow to Turn Off Your PC Using Your Smartphone 14 comments Write a Comment Kunal Radia October 14, 2016 at 6:45 am Count Me in :) I would really love to have google pixel c tablet .

It allows you to hold the device by the keyboard without the worry of dropping it. I believe this is as good if not better than an iPad and is purely down to your OS preference. I prefer Android over iOS. And the only think that makes this more practical than an iPad is the very awesome keyboard. Android N and split screen are just a recent bonus.

Share a story idea here (link opens in a new window) Friday September 9 2016 Scott Anderson / James Militzer / Kyle Poplin Weekly Roundup: A Different Kind of Pivot in SE Asia, a Surprising Collaboration in India and South Africa’s Sweet Move President Barack Obama this week wrapped up his final trip to Asia in his attempt to “pivot” his foreign policy agenda eastward. Although the results of Obama’s trip are in dispute, there’s little debate when it comes to the growing clout of Southeast Asia’s entrepreneurial class – including its bumper crop of social enterprises. It’s a long-term trend that can’t be summed up in a single Roundup post. Nevertheless, it feels like just about every week we hear about a new conference, incubator, accelerator, fund or university program designed to enable startups – from Singapore to the Philippines to Laos. “From our perspective at the National University of Singapore (NUS), we observe a remarkable and growing interest in social entrepreneurship,” wrote associate professors Audrey Chia and Lim Yee Wei last month. “NUS hosts a social venture competition each year. Last year we had 683 entries and this year we have 1,027. The quality of entries has also improved.” In July, 50 “developed social enterprises” and 30 private-public sector partners participated in the first-ever ASEAN Conference on Social Entrepreneurship in Singapore, where they met with and pitched to investors. The finalists will make a final pitch to investors in October in Jakarta. (Singapore also plays host to the BoP World Convention next month.) “One of the main reasons why social innovation and entrepreneurship is flourishing is because many old policies and ways of working cannot solve some of today’s most pressing global issues. It requires truly novel solutions,” Jean Tan, executive director of Singapore International Foundation, said in a press release. Krisztina Tora, who leads the Global Social Entrepreneurship Network, which supports early-stage social entrepreneurs, recently wrote about the gelling of many social business groups in the region and some of the deep-seated cultural issues social entrepreneurs often face: “There (is) general agreement that talent is a major barrier for social entrepreneurs and their supporters. This is especially true in Asia where there is societal and parental pressure to have a ‘successful career’ (i.e. a traditional/conservative vision of what professional success looks like) and therefore entrepreneurship is seen as a sort of failure or a last resort choice.” And as Sankalp Forum pointed out in its e-newsletter this week: “Despite facing the typical challenges of operating in an emerging market, what is interesting in the Filipino ecosystem is the number of startups that are focusing on social impact, and the creative solution of the government for increasing the impact of SMEs: GoNegosyo. Corporations are playing their part as well, backing social enterprises as a means to achieve the SDGs.” Is this an anecdotal list? Absolutely. And comparing one region’s social enterprise prowess to another is risky business. But considering the burst of activity across Southeast Asia, it’s everyone’s business to pay a bit more attention.  – By Scott Anderson Truth Tweet In Development, It’s Not the First Time in History that it has been the First Time in History pic.twitter.com/5oc67DhJwN — William Easterly (@bill_easterly) September 9, 2016   Can Google Boost India’s Financial Literacy? India’s financial inclusion drive has scored some impressive successes – including bringing some 77 million women into the formal banking system in just one year. But the outlook isn’t entirely rosy: Almost 76 percent of Indian adults lack an adequate understanding of key financial concepts, according to a recent survey, and the country’s household savings rate has fallen significantly. To address these issues, the government is apparently turning, in part, to Google. According to unnamed Google and Indian government representatives quoted in the Economic Times, the tech behemoth is designing a website and mobile app called Bharat Saves, which it hopes to align with the national financial inclusion initiative. The site, which is targeted at homemakers, small business owners, the newly employed, retired persons and farmers, will reportedly include two phases. First, users must log in, complete financial literacy modules, and take a financial literacy test. Then they will be able to access a second section of the platform, where they can compare and purchase banking and insurance products. Since this is Google we’re talking about, it’s hard to avoid concerns about the privacy of low-income users, and how all this detailed data on their financial lives will be put to use. But assuming the government keeps any of Google’s more aggressive data-collecting impulses in check, this could be an exciting collaboration. – By James Militzer   Mixed News for Microfinance The latest quarterly report from India’s Microfinance Institutions Network underscores the sector’s growing momentum in the country. A few highlights: Credit disbursal grew by 29 percent in the April-June period, and loan portfolios have grown 89 percent industry-wide since the first quarter of 2015-16. Microfinance is proving to be an important source of security for the elderly in underprivileged communities, with microfinance institutions (MFIs) seeing their pension accounts grow by 108 percent in the first quarter, compared to the same time last year. On the downside, smaller MFIs seem to be struggling to access capital, with large MFIs receiving over 90 percent of debt funding from banks and other financial institutions this quarter. On a more somber note, new analysis from some prominent researchers points toward some troubling findings for the global industry. According to Bob Cull, Asli Demirguc-Kunt and Jonathan Morduch, the industry remains largely dependent on subsidies – including most for-profit MFIs. What’s more, “dependence on subsidies declines but does not disappear as institutions become older,” and those subsidies often aren’t focused on expanding access to those who might benefit most from them, including poorer customers and women. The research was based on data from 930 microfinance institutions with some 80 million combined customers. One intriguing takeaway: The findings “underline the importance of pursuing new ways to change the cost structure faced by most microfinance institutions such as digital payments and mobile money.” – By James Militzer   ImpInv report Just launched: Latin American #impinv report w/ @lavca_org & @LGT_IV!

Not just because they invented a badly needed product – the Hemafuse, a low-cost blood transfusion device – but because they’re providing a roadmap on how to commercialize it.  From their thoughtful, inclusive design phase through their funding efforts, the three women behind Sisu (including two graduates from the University of Michigan, NextBillion’s stomping ground) have taken carefully measured steps in pursuit of their passion. This week, they announced that they’ve reached 80 percent of the goal in their $1 million seed round, recently netting $500,000 from the Camden Partners Exelixis Fund – the first investment made by the new fund focused on growing companies in Maryland. Meanwhile, they’re beginning clinical studies of the Hemafuse in Ethiopia.  If your goal is to solve a global health problem with technology, you’d do well to read up on Sisu. If you do, be prepared to be impressed. – By Kyle Poplin South Africa’s sweet move South Africa’s Department of Health explained this week why, starting in 2017, it will become the first African country to charge a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Bottom line: People there are fat and getting fatter, and obesity is overall bad for business. It’s clear that free markets can solve problems, but market tweaks from government, such as “sin taxes,” can modify behaviors and save lives while easing skyrocketing health care burdens on specific economies. South Africa is an appropriate place to try the tax. One in four South Africans are obese and one in five consume an excessive amount of sugar – 17 teaspoons per day, on average, almost double WHO’s recommended amount. But it’s clear that excessive sugar consumption is a global problem. The average Mexican, for example, consumes 35 teaspoons per day. That led Mexico to impose a tax similar to South Africa’s, and it’s “been relatively effective in reducing the consumption of sugary beverages,” tax expert Kyle Mandy told the BBC. South African officials should, of course, monitor the tax after implementation to weigh its benefits and costs, but in the meantime they should be applauded for being the first on their continent to take this particular step in the battle against non-communicable diseases. – By Kyle Poplin IN CASE YOU MISSED IT … THIS WEEK ON NEXTBILLION Finding the Right Last-Mile Distribution Model Stopping the Spread of ‘Superbugs’: Six Promising Solutions What We’re Learning Every Step of the Energy Ladder The Volatile ‘Face’ of Digital Financial Services in Zambia   Photo by John Ragai via Flickr.

Let's examine a handful of his most insightful quotes about the future of Google, his sprawling set of Other Bets, leadership, and more. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Sep 10, 2016 at 10:21AM Image source: Getty Images. Larry Page is the co-founder and CEO of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the holding company for Google and the diverse menagerie of Other Bets the company has more recently spawned. He's also the 11th richest person on Earth and an avid kiteboarder, both of which I discovered by asking the search engine his company created.  Having accomplished so much by the tender age of 43, it's safe to say Larry Page stands as one of the most powerful and influential figures in business today. Let's examine a few interesting quotes from the Alphabet co-founder on a wide range of subjects. Larry Page on business and technology Many of us think of Larry Page, his co-founder Sergey Brin, and Alphabet's longtime third-in-command Eric Schmidt as genius inventors, and that's certainly true -- to an extent. Each member of Alphabet's famous triumvirate is a talented computer scientist, to be sure. However, Page will also be the first to admit that Alphabet's overwhelming success didn't come from inventing the search engine, but rather from bringing this technology to the masses: Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. You have to combine both things: invention and innovation focus, plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people.  In the years since its founding, Alphabet has developed an incredibly diverse suite of products. And though advertising from a few core products still generates the bulk of its sales, it's clear that Page sees his company's broader mission as less tethered to any one product as it is simply creating great technology: We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to create beautiful, intuitive services and technologies that are so incredibly useful that people use them twice a day. Like they use a toothbrush. There aren't that many things people use twice a day.  One of the most defining characteristics of the technology industry, perhaps more so than most industries, is its propensity for constant change. Continually thriving in this environment requires constant reinvention and an eye to the future. Here's how Page frames this business challenge in his own words: Lots of companies don't succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future. I try to focus on that: What is the future really going to be? And how do we create it? And how do we power our organization to really focus on that and really drive it at a high rate?  Without question, one of the areas of greatest interest in tech today lies in AI, or artificial intelligence, an area of clear longtime interest for Page. In fact, this quote from all the way back in 2000 shows just how long Page and his counterparts at Alphabet have been thinking about this topic, which only recently became the tech topic de jour: Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we have the ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the Web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. That's obviously artificial intelligence, to be able to answer any question, basically, because almost everything is on the Web, right? We're nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on. And that's tremendously interesting from an intellectual standpoint.  Larry Page on leadership and life Like many business moguls, Page is often sought out for insight on topics beyond technology and business. As the man tasked with guiding a global organization, Page knows something of leadership as well. Here's how the billionaire articulates his thinking on the matter: My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they're having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. As a world, we're doing a better job of that. My goal is for Google to lead, not follow that.  Though some argue it has waned as its size has increased, Alphabet also gained acclaim thanks to its unique corporate culture. In fact, the company served as the poster child for tech's corporate culture, and it's clear that its more open and casual ethos came from the top down, as Page once said: It's important that the company be a family, that people feel that they're part of the company, and that the company is like a family to them. When you treat people that way, you get better productivity.  However, despite Alphabet's overwhelming success and bullish outlook, it's clear that Page's motivation to co-found the company lay outside the possible fame and fortune it eventually wrought. To a surprising degree, this somewhat counterintuitive sentiment appears as a common thread throughout the careers of many of business' most successful leaders. Page nicely summarized his own attitudes toward material pursuits in the following way: If we were motivated by money, we would have sold the company a long time ago and ended up on a beach.  Changing the world requires a unique -- some might say lucky -- mix of timing and ability, and Page clearly fits the bill in both regards. The man helped create one of the most powerful technology companies the world has ever known, and he's likely just getting started. Especially with presumably so much time left to further Alphabet's ambitions, it will be fascinating to see what the road ahead holds for one of the digital age's most renowned names.

Huffington wants to sell your boss on office naps Rebecca Greenfield, Bloomberg 9:06 a.m. EDT September 10, 2016 Arianna Huffington (Photo: Evan Agostini, Associated Press) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Weeks after leaving her eponymous news website to launch a corporate wellness service called Thrive, Arianna Huffington has hired former New York Times and Google executives for the new venture, aiming to teach companies to "treat the whole human being." As it enters the crowded workplace wellness industry, with its quit-smoking incentives and step challenges, Thrive intends to go beyond the usual offerings to focus on "the mental aspects of our lives, what's happening in our heads," Huffington said in an interview. "This is all something that you bring to work," she added. Huffington spent more than a decade running the Huffington Post, which she founded in 2005, but over the years her interest shifted from news to the pursuit of elusive work-life balance. In the last two years, she has published two books - "Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and "Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder" and the nap-at-work manifesto "The Sleep Revolution" - full of theories she's now spinning into her new business. Last month, she announced she was leaving her namesake site to pursue her latest venture. Thrive will officially launch Nov. 30, Huffington said. In the meantime, the company is staffing up: Rajiv Pant, a former chief technology officer at the New York Times, has come on as CTO, and Kathryn Friedrich, who spent the better part of a decade at Google and YouTube, will join next month as chief marketing officer. Both said Huffington's plea for a more humane work-life balance drew them to the organization. "I was truly stressed out. This is something I personally connected with," said Pant. "If you look at my tweets, they're about behavior, getting enough sleep. This is the right company." Friedrich thinks Thrive can create a more positive work-life experience than even Google, considered an Eden of workplace culture. "Google tries to create a good existence for their employees. They do a fantastic job," she said. "The one thing that might be missing that Arianna wants to bring to the table are metrics. It's one thing to put all the offerings out there. It's another thing to measure the success of those things." (Google is known for studying its company culture's effects on employees' productivity and happiness.) At its core, Thrive is a corporate wellness consultancy: Companies pay Thrive-trained coaches to bestow health and wellness tips on their overworked and underperforming staffs. They can opt for online courses or in-person trainings, with sessions ranging from a couple of hours to six weeks. Huffington said that the consulting firm Accenture has already piloted trainings and that JPMorgan Chase has also signed on for a partnership. DELAWAREONLINE Missing information halts Europe's review of DuPont deal DELAWAREONLINE 10 of fall's fun events - starting with 3 this weekend In addition to its courses, Thrive will also have a media arm, as Bloomberg reported in June. Huffington has previously said Thrive is not a media company but said in an interview that it will have "a consumer platform attached to the corporate platform that will be constantly reinforcing our message." Much like the Huffington Post, the site will rely on big names, like athletes and experts, for its content. It will also sell wellness-related products like pillows and food supplements, and Huffington hopes it will eventually become a discussion platform open to the public - something the company is working on with Medium, she said. The sell? All of this, in theory, services Thrive's clients' bottom lines. But with its entry into the corporate wellness industry, which market research firm IBISWorld values at $6 billion, Thrive is competing within an already crowded space. And Huffington - who champions digital detoxing, office napping and actually unplugging on vacation - is not alone in pushing mindfulness on companies. Many other wellness companies address both body and mind, too, offering office fitness alongside meditation. Corporate wellness budgets have ballooned as companies try to curb health insurance costs, since a healthier workforce means lower insurance costs and higher productivity. But a much-cited RAND Corporation study has called many such wellness offerings into question, finding that for all the money poured into them, they save little on health care: For every $1 spent on "lifestyle management" programs - like smoking cessation and weight-loss initiatives - companies saved just 50 cents, the study found. Huffington is confident Thrive's holistic approach will yield better results for both clients and workers, saying the Rand study "really didn't address things like stress and burnout." Thrive, she said, will rely only on "evidence-based" methods for its courses; it has hired Adam Grant, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, to study its work with Accenture. "As we get more evidence, we will be adopting and adjusting everything we are doing," said Huffington. Maybe napping at the office only works during certain times of day? Or maybe meetings are actually better when everyone has a cell phone? For now, in its own SoHo offices, Thrive plans to practice what it preaches. Meetings will be device-free. ("We have beautiful notebooks," said Huffington.) And, yes, there will be a place to nap.

Thanks to all of SitePoint’s peer reviewers for making SitePoint content the best it can be! AdMob is a mobile advertising platform from Google that developers can use to generate revenue from apps through in-app advertising. AdMob provides different sets of ads like banner ads, interstitial ads, video ads, or native ads integrated with native UI components. AdMob uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK which helps maximizing revenue and achieve massive scale with Google’s ad solutions. The focus of this article is to integrate AdMob with your apps, but before doing this it’s a good idea to understand the best practices and policies of how to implement ads. I recommend the AdMob YouTube videos for banner ads and interstitial ads. More from this author A Step by Step Guide to Building an Android Audio Player App Tidy and Optimize Your Java Code with Android Butter Knife Getting Started with AdMob First sign up to the AdMob service. Open the AdMob homepage. Click on the Monetize tab. Click on Monetize new app. Select the ad format Banner, Interstitial, Rewarded interstitial, or Native. Fill in the Ad unit name input. You can choose to link your ads to firebase. For this example I skipped this step. You can add different ad formats to your apps. For the sample app I am presenting in this article I created three different ad formats, banner, interstitial and native ads. To add new ad units to an app open the Monetize tab, and select the app. Configuration Create a new Android Project with an empty activity and add the following dependencies to build.gradle (Module: app).     dependencies {
        compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:9.4.0'
    }
 In res/values/strings.xml add the ads unit IDs. In my case the IDs look as follows. <!--Ad unit ID-->
<string name="admob_banner_ad">ca-app-pub-3306270630045532/9042995609</string>
<string name="admob_interstitial_ad">ca-app-pub-3306270630045532/1519728802</string>
<string name="admob_native_ad">ca-app-pub-3306270630045532/4473195204</string>
 In AndroidManifest.xml include the required permissions for Google Mobile Ads to run. <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
 Integrating Ads into an Android App The rest of this tutorial consist of three examples on how to integrate the ads you created into an Android app. You can integrate each of the examples into a standalone app, but in the GitHub repository for this project, I added the ads as different fragments and the process is similar. Banner Ads In this section I will focus on adding banner ads and event handling. Adding banner ads to an Android project is the easiest option, compared with the process of integrating other ad types. Choose an appropriate place in a layout file and add the following code snippet, for example an Activity‘s layout file. <com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView
    android:id="@+id/adView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
    ads:adSize="SMART_BANNER"
    ads:adUnitId="@string/admob_banner_ad">
</com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView>
 I specified the ad size as SMART_BANNER which sets the width of the banner to match the screen size, but AdMob has multiple sizes available. Read the documentation for more. Make sure to add the name-space used for ads in the container Layout of the layout file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:ads="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">
  ...
  <com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView>
    ...
  </com.google.android.gms.ads.AdView>
</RelativeLayout>
 Now you have added the AdView to the layout file you must load content into it. In the Activity class which will display the ad, create the following global instance. private AdView adView;
 In the Activity onCreate() method add the following code snippet. // Initialize the Mobile Ads SDK.
MobileAds.initialize(this, getResources().getString(R.string.admob_banner_ad));
adView = (AdView) findViewById(R.id.adView);
AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
        .build();
adView.loadAd(adRequest);
 When testing ads during development it’s recommended that you specify AdRequest as a test device. For this tutorial I have not specified any test device. AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .addTestDevice("DEVICE ID")
    .build();
 An important part of managing ads are the Activity‘s lifecycle methods, so add the following methods to the MainActivity class. @Override
public void onPause() {
  super.onPause();
  if (adView != null) adView.pause();
}

@Override
public void onResume() {
  super.onResume();
  if (adView != null) adView.resume();
}

@Override
public void onDestroy() {
  super.onDestroy();
  if (adView != null) adView.destroy();
}
 Run the Android project and take a look at your cool ads. Ad Events Another important part of managing ads are lifecycle events. The list of ad events includes events like loading, opening, closing, failed to load and AdLeftApplication. You can chose to listen for any of the lifecycle events, in the following code I setup listeners for all possible events in onCreate. adView.setAdListener(new AdListener() {
  @Override
  public void onAdClosed() {
      super.onAdClosed();
      //user returns to the app after tapping on an ad.
  }

  @Override
  public void onAdFailedToLoad(int i) {
      super.onAdFailedToLoad(i);
      //Ad request fails.
  }

  @Override
  public void onAdLeftApplication() {
      super.onAdLeftApplication();
      //User left the app.
  }

  @Override
  public void onAdOpened() {
      super.onAdOpened();
      //Ad displayed on the screen.
  }

  @Override
  public void onAdLoaded() {
      super.onAdLoaded();
      //Ad finishes loading.
  }
});
 These events work both for banner and interstitial ads. Interstitial Ads Interstitial are full-screen ads that cover the full interface of the app. As the name suggests, the full-screen nature of this ads blocks the ability for the user to interact with the interface of the app so you should be careful when displaying interstitial ads. A good way do display them is at app’s transition points and it’s not a good idea to show this kind of ad frequently. Interstitials do not have a layout to load them, you load them in java code. Create a global instance for the interstitial add in MainActivity. private InterstitialAd interstitialAd;
 To show a interstitial ad, call the following function. private void loadInterstitialAd() {
  interstitialAd = new InterstitialAd(this);
  interstitialAd.setAdUnitId(getResources().getString(R.string.admob_interstitial_ad));
  AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
          .build();
  interstitialAd.loadAd(adRequest);
  interstitialAd.setAdListener(new AdListener() {
      @Override
      public void onAdLoaded() {
          super.onAdLoaded();
          interstitialAd.show();
      }
  });
}
 Keep in mind that interstitial ads use a lot of bandwidth and need time to load, so it’s important to show them after the loading process is complete. You can use the lifecycle events I showed earlier with interstitials to listen to certain ad events. Native Ads Native ads are a great way to customize ads to fit apps contents. Native Ads are CSS templates of the ad view. AdMob provides two different ways to implement native ads, Native Ads Express and Native Ads Advanced. Native Ads Express are CSS templates created in the AdMob panel based on predefined view and ad templates. For developers who want full control over ad presentation, AdMob provides Native Ads Advanced. In the following example of Native Ads, I will work with Express Ads. The process of adding native ads in an Android project is similar to banner ads so the main focus of the following section is to build a RecyclerView with native ads included as of its items. Building a RecyclerView requires a RecyclerView.Adapter, a RecyclerView.ViewHolder and a layout file for the RecyclerView items. It’s a good idea to have this item layout to look like with the Native Ads layout to make the ads integrate nicely with the rest of the app. For my example, the following layout will do. Create res/layout/item_layout.xml and add the following. <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="100dp"
    android:orientation="horizontal">

    <ImageView
        android:layout_width="80dp"
        android:layout_height="80dp"
        android:layout_marginBottom="8dp"
        android:layout_marginTop="15dp"
        android:src="@android:drawable/ic_menu_gallery" />

    <LinearLayout
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_marginTop="25dp"
        android:orientation="vertical">

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/itemTitle"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal"
            android:layout_marginBottom="4dp"
            android:text="RecyclerView Item"
            android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceLarge" />

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/itemDescription"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal"
            android:text="RecyclerView Item Description"
            android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium" />
    </LinearLayout>
</LinearLayout>
 And res/layout/native_ad.xml <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:ads="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView
        android:id="@+id/nativeAdView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        ads:adSize="340x100"
        ads:adUnitId="@string/admob_native_ad">

    </com.google.android.gms.ads.NativeExpressAdView>

</LinearLayout>
 In the MainActivity layout file add a RecyclerView layout. <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:id="@+id/recyclerview"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
 Setup RecyclerView Adapter For a RecyclerView to display content it needs an adapter and a ViewHolder. Create a new java class called RV_Adapter and add the following code. public class RV_Adapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<ViewHolder> {

    private static final int ITEM = 0;
    private static final int NATIVE_AD = 1;
    int[] viewTypes;
    List<Data> list = Collections.emptyList();

    public RV_Adapter(List<Data> list, int[] viewTypes) {
        this.list = list;
        this.viewTypes = viewTypes;
    }

    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        //Inflate the layout, initialize the View Holder
        View v;
        if (viewType == ITEM) {
            v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_layout, parent, false);
            ViewHolder holder = new ItemViewHolder(v);
            return holder;
        } else if (viewType == NATIVE_AD) {
            v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.native_ad, parent, false);
            ViewHolder holder = new AdViewHolder(v);
            return holder;
        }
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, int position) {
        if (viewHolder.getItemViewType() == ITEM) {
            ItemViewHolder holder = (ItemViewHolder) viewHolder;
            //populate the RecyclerView
            //holder.title.setText(list.get(position).getTitle());
            //holder.description.setText(list.get(position).getDescription());
        } else if (viewHolder.getItemViewType() == NATIVE_AD) {
            AdViewHolder holder = (AdViewHolder) viewHolder;
            //Load the Ad
            AdRequest request = new AdRequest.Builder()
                    .build();
            holder.adView.loadAd(request);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        return list.size();
    }

    @Override
    public void onAttachedToRecyclerView(RecyclerView recyclerView) {
        super.onAttachedToRecyclerView(recyclerView);
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemViewType(int position) {
        return viewTypes[position];
    }
}

class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
    public ViewHolder(View v) {
        super(v);
    }
}

class ItemViewHolder extends ViewHolder {

    TextView title;
    TextView description;

    ItemViewHolder(View itemView) {
        super(itemView);
        title = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.itemTitle);
        description = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.itemDescription);
    }
}

class AdViewHolder extends ViewHolder {
    NativeExpressAdView adView;

    public AdViewHolder(View v) {
        super(v);
        adView = (NativeExpressAdView) v.findViewById(R.id.nativeAdView);
    }
}
 This class contains the RecyclerView.Adapter and three ViewHolder classes for the different RecyclerView items. There’s a lot of code and three other java classes only used in this adapter. You are free to implement them in different files, but make sure to import the right references to those classes. You load Native Ads in the RecyclerView in the adapters onBindViewHolder(). Binding this ad is similar to Banner Ads. The RecyclerView is filled with a list of Data objects, so create the following class in the Android project. public class Data {

    private String title;
    private String description;

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }
}
 Displaying a List of Ads The final step to integrate Native Ads in a RecyclerView is to create the following function in MainActivity. private void initRecyclerView() {
  //Create dummy data for RecyclerView
  int listSize = 50;
  int ITEM = 0;
  int NATIVE_AD = 1;
  List<Data> data = new ArrayList<>();
  int[] viewTypes = new int[listSize];
  for (int i = 0; i < listSize; i++) {
      data.add(new Data());
      //insert native ads once in five items
      if (i > 1 && i % 5 == 0) {
          viewTypes[i] = NATIVE_AD;
      } else {
          viewTypes[i] = ITEM;
      }
  }
  RecyclerView recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recyclerview);
  RV_Adapter adapter = new RV_Adapter(data, viewTypes);
  recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
  recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this));
}
 This function generates a list of 50 Data items, with a Native Ad inserted every 5 items. In a real life project you wouldn’t insert ads this frequently as it would lead to a bad user experience. When the RecyclerView adapter is initiated, it’s constructor passes an array of Integers to notify the adapter when it’s time to display an Ad. Call this function in the MainActivity onCreate() method and run the project. Targeting Another great feature of AdMob is the possibility to target a specified user, to display ads related to specific conditions. Examples of targeting are displaying ads related to a specified location or user gender. To display ads based on a target group specify a targeting specification in AdRequest.Builder(). Here’s an example on how to target users based on location: AdRequest request = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .setLocation(userLocation)
    .build();
 Based on gender: AdRequest request = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .setGender(AdRequest.GENDER_FEMALE)
    .build();
 Based on birthday:     AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .setBirthday(userBirthdayDate)
    .build();
 Based on Child-directed policies, and whether Google should treat the ad content as child-directed. AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder()
    .tagForChildDirectedTreatment(true)
    .build();

Diagnose, Minimize & Reverse the Damage Google Algorithms Explained, Pt. 2: Provide Better Answers Google Algorithms Explained, Part 1: Don't Be Spam A robots.txt file is a plain text file that specifies whether or not a crawler should or shouldn’t access specific folders, subfolders or pages, along with other information about your site. The file uses the Robots Exclusion Standard, a protocol set in 1994 for websites to communicate with crawlers and other bots. It’s absolutely essential that you use a plain text file. Creating a robots.txt file using HTML or a word processor will include code that search engine crawlers will ignore if they can’t read. How Does It Work? When a site owner wants to give some guidance to web crawlers, they put their robots.txt file in the root directory of their site, e.g. https://www.example.com/robots.txt. Bots that follow this protocol will fetch and read the file before fetching any other file from the site. If the site doesn’t have a robots.txt, the crawler will assume the webmaster didn’t want to give any specific instructions and will go on to crawl the entire site. Robots.txt is made up of two basic parts: User-agent and directives. User-Agent User-agent is the name of the spider being addressed, while the directive lines provide the instructions for that particular user-agent. The User-agent line always goes before the directive lines in each set of directives. A very basic robots.txt looks like this: User-agent: Googlebot

Disallow: /
 These directives instruct the user-agent Googlebot, Google’s web crawler, to stay away from the entire server — it won’t crawl any page on the site. If you want to give instructions to multiple robots, create a set of user-agents and disallow directives for each one. User-agent: Googlebot

Disallow: /

User-agent: Bingbot

Disallow: /
 Now both Google and Bing’s user-agents know to avoid crawling the entire site. If you want to set the same requirement for all robots, you can use what’s called a wildcard, represented with an asterisk (*). So if you want to allow all robots to crawl your entire site, your robots.txt file should look like this: User-agent: *

Disallow: 
 It’s worth noting that search engines will choose the most specific user-agent directives they can find. So, for example, say you have four sets of user-agents: One using using a wildcard (*), one for Googlebot, one for Googlebot-News and one for Bingbot, and your site is visited by the Googlebot-Images user-agent. That bot will follow the instructions for Googlebot, as it is the most specific set of directives that apply to it. The most common search engine user-agents are: User-Agent Search Engine Field baiduspider Baidu General baiduspider-image Baidu Images baiduspider-mobile Baidu Mobile baiduspider-news Baidu News baiduspider-video Baidu Video bingbot Bing General msnbot Bing General msnbot-media Bing Images & Video adidxbot Bing Ads Googlebot Google General Googlebot-Image Google Images Googlebot-Mobile Google Mobile Googlebot-News Google News Googlebot-Video Google Video Mediapartners-Google Google AdSense AdsBot-Google Google AdWords slurp Yahoo! General yandex Yandex General Disallow The second part of robots.txt is the disallow line. This directive tells spiders which pages they aren’t allowed to crawl. You can have multiple disallow lines per set of directives, but only one user-agent. You don’t have to put any value for the disallow directive; bots will interpret an empty disallow value to mean that you aren’t disallowing anything and will access the entire site. As we mentioned earlier, if you want to deny access to the entire site to a bot (or all bots), use a slash (/). You can get granular with disallow directives by specifying specific pages, directories, subdirectories and file types. To block crawlers from a specific page, use that page’s relative link in the disallow line: User-agent: *

Disallow: /directory/page.html
 Block access to whole directories the same way: User-agent: *

Disallow: /folder1/

Disallow: /folder2/
 You can also use robots.txt to block bots from crawling certain file types by using a wildcard and file type in the disallow line: User-agent: *

Disallow: /*.ppt

Disallow: /images/*.jpg

Disallow: /duplicatecontent/copy*.html
 While the robots.txt protocol technically doesn’t support the use of wildcards, search engine bots are able to recognize and interpret them. So in the directives above, a robot would automatically expand the asterisk to match the path of the filename. For example, it would be able to figure out that www.example.com/presentations/slideshow.ppt and www.example.com/images/example.jpg are disallowed while www.example.com/presentations/slideshowtranscript.html isn’t. The third disallows crawling of any file in the /duplicatecontent/ directory that starts with ‘copy’ and ends in ‘.html’. So these pages are blocked: /duplicatecontent/copy.html /duplicatecontent/copy1.html /duplicatecontent/copy2.html /duplicatecontent/copy.html?id=1234 However, it would not disallow any instances of ‘copy.html’ stored in another directory or subdirectory. One issue you might encounter with your robots.txt file is that some URLs contain excluded patterns in URLs we would actually want to be crawled. From our earlier example of Disallow: /images/*.jpg, that directory might contain a file called ‘description-of-.jpg.html’. That page would not be crawled because it matches the exclusion pattern. To resolve this, add a dollar symbol ($) to signify that it represents the end of a line. This will tell search engine crawlers to avoid only files that end in the exclusion pattern. So Disallow: /images/*.jpg$ blocks only files that end in ‘.jpg’ while allowing files that include ‘.jpg’ in the title. Allow Sometimes you might want to exclude every file in a directory but one. You can do this the hard way by writing a disallow line for every file except the one you want crawled. Or you can use the Allow directive. It works pretty much like you would expect it to: Add the ‘Allow’ line to the group of directives for a user-agent: User-agent: *

Allow: /folder/subfolder/file.html

Disallow: /folder/subfolder/
 Wildcards and pattern-matching rules work the same for the Allow directive as they do for Disallow. Non-Standard Directives There are a few other directives you can use in your robots.txt file that aren’t universally recognized by search engines. One is the Host directive. This is recognized by Yandex, the most popular search engine in Russia, and works as a www resolve. However, as it seems Yandex is the only major search engine that supports the Host directive, we don’t recommend using it. The best way to handle the www resolve is using 301 redirects. Another directive that’s supported by some search engines is crawl-delay. It specifies a numerical value that represents a number of seconds — the crawl-delay line should look like crawl-delay: 15. It’s used differently by Yahoo!, Bing and Yandex. Yahoo! and Bing use the value as a wait time between crawl actions while Yandex will use it as a wait time for accessing your site. If you’ve got a big site you probably don’t want to use this directive as it can seriously limit the number of pages that get crawled. However, if you get little to no traffic from those search engines, you can use crawl-delay to save bandwidth. You can also set the crawl-delay to specific user agents. For example, you may find that your site is frequently crawled by SEO tools, which could slow down your site. You may also wish to block them all together if you don’t feel they are helping you. Finally, you can use your robots.txt file to tell search engines where to find your sitemap by adding the Sitemap: line anywhere in the file. This directive is independent of user-agent so bots will be able to interpret it wherever you put it, but it’s best to put it at the end to make things easier on yourself. Create a new sitemap line for every sitemap that you have, including your image and video sitemaps or your sitemap index file. If you would rather your sitemap location was not available for all to see, you may prefer to leave this out and instead submit sitemaps to the search engines directly. Learn more about how to create and optimize your XML sitemap here. Why Would You Want One? If getting your site crawled, indexed and ranked in search engine results is the whole point of SEO, why would you ever want to exclude files on your site? There’s a couple of reasons you’d want to block bot access to areas of your site: You’ve got private folders, subfolders or files on your site — just keep in mind that anyone can read your robots.txt file, so highlighting the location of a private file using the disallow directive would reveal it to the world. By blocking less important pages on your site you prioritize the bots’ crawl budget. This means they’ll spend more time crawling and indexing your most important pages. If you don’t get traffic from certain search engines, save bandwidth by disallowing their user-agents. There’s no point in having Yandex or Baidu fetching your files if they don’t send you any organic traffic. You can also use robots.txt to prevent search engines from indexing duplicate content. If you use URL parameters that result in your site housing the same content across several pages, use wildcards to exclude those URLs: User-agent: *

Disallow: /*?
 This will prevent crawlers from accessing any pages that have question marks in the URL, which is often how parameters are added. This is especially helpful for e-commerce sites that wind up with lots of URL parameters causing a ton of duplicate content due to product filtering and sorting. It’s best practice to block access to your site while redesigning or migrating, which we covered in detail previously. Block access to your entire new site to avoid having it associated with duplicate content, which will hinder its ability to rank in the future. Common Problems with Robots.txt and How to Fix Them To check if you’ve got a problem with your robots.txt, open up Google Search Console. Check your Crawl Stats report to see if there’s a big drop off in the number of pages crawled per day; this could indicate a problem with your robots.txt. Possibly the biggest problem with robots.txt files is accidentally disallowing pages you actually want to get crawled. This information can be found in your GSC Crawl Errors report. Check for pages that return a 500 response code. This is the code often returned for pages blocked by robots.txt. Check any URLs that return a 500 error code against your disallow directives in the robots.txt file. Some other common issues with robots.txt files are: Accidentally adding forward slashes at the end of file names. Even though your canonical URL might include the trailing slash, adding this to the end of a line in robots.txt will cause bots to interpret it as a directory, not a file, blocking every page in the folder. Double check your disallow lines for trailing slashes that shouldn’t be there. Blocking resources like CSS and JavaScript codes using robots.txt. However, this will impact the way search engines will see your page. A while back Google stated that disallowing CSS and Javascript will count against your SEO. Google can read your CSS and JS code and use it to draw conclusions about your site. When it sees blocked resources like this it can’t properly render your page which will keep you from ranking as highly as you could otherwise. Using more than one User-agent directive per line. Search engines will disregard directives that include more than one user-agent in a line, which can cause them to improperly crawl your site. Improper capitalization of directory, subdirectory and file names. While the actual directives used in robots.txt are not case sensitive, their values are. So Search engines see Disallow: page.html, Disallow: Page.html and Disallow: page.HTML as three separate files. If your robots.txt file includes directives for ‘Page.html’ but your canonical URL is in all lowercase, that page will get crawled. Using the Noindex directive. It’s a little known secret in SEO that you can use the noindex directive in your robots.txt file. However, John Mueller stated last year that you should avoid using noindex in your robots.txt file. So follow best practice and stick to the disallow and allow directives. Contradicting your sitemap in your robots.txt file. This is most likely to happen if you use different tools to create your sitemap and robots.txt files. Contradicting yourself in front of the search engines is always a bad idea. Fortunately this is pretty easy to find and fix. Submit and crawl your sitemap via GSC. It will provide you with a list of errors that you can then check against your robots.txt file to see if you’ve excluded it there. Disallowing pages in your robots.txt file that use the noindex meta tag. Crawlers blocked from accessing the page won’t be able to see the noindex tag, which can cause your page to appear in search results if it’s linked to from another page. It’s also common to struggle with the robots.txt syntax, especially if you don’t have much of a technical background. One solution is to have someone who is familiar with the robots protocol to go over your file for syntax errors. Your other, and probably better option, is to go right to Google for testing. Open the tester in Google Search Console and paste in your robots.txt file and hit Test. What’s really handy here is that not only will it find errors in your file, but you can also see if you’re disallowing pages that Google has indexed. When creating or changing your robots.txt file you really must test it thoroughly using this tool. Adding a robots.txt file that has errors will likely seriously impact your site’s ability to get crawled and indexed, which can cause it to fall out of the search rankings.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Tim Moynihan. Tim Moynihan Gear Date of Publication: 09.10.16. 09.10.16 Time of Publication: 6:45 am. 6:45 am Vizio Takes On Sonos With Its Double-Duty Wireless Speakers Vizio Sonos speakers are great, and they’ve popularized multi-room wireless audio. They still have weaknesses. They don’t do Bluetooth, they need to be plugged into power outlets, and even when Sonos opens itself up to Spotify early next year, you need Sonos’s app to play music from other sources. Vizio sees those shortcomings as opportunities. The company has been making soundbars to slot under its affordable televisions a while, but its new SmartCast Crave speakers are its first standalone speakers designed for wireless multi-room audio. Like newer Vizio TVs, they offer deep integration with Google Cast: Any Google Cast-supported audio app streams directly to the speakers over Wi-Fi or Ethernet. You use your mobile device as a controller, but the speakers form their own connection to streaming services. It’s a living-room (or kitchen or bedroom) Wi-Fi speaker that can also be used as a portable Bluetooth speaker—and a good one, at that. The one primed to give the Sonos Play:1 a run for the money is the Crave 360. It’s a cylindrical speaker with a magnetic charging base, pumping out 95 decibels of sound in all directions with four 1.5-inch drivers and a single 3.5-inch subwoofer. It also looks pretty slick, with a stainless steel tube of a grille, a rotating glass-covered top for volume and playback controls, and a leather strap for toting it around. You can leave it on that plugged-in charging base when you’re at home, then pop it off to use as a high-end portable Bluetooth or Wi-Fi speaker with its 8-hour battery. So it’s a living-room (or kitchen or bedroom) Wi-Fi speaker that can also be used as a portable Bluetooth speaker—and a good one, at that. Although it also supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Google Cast playback, the upcoming Crave Pro is a fixed, plug-in speaker. It has a pair of 2-inch drivers and 5.25-inch subwoofers, and it gets louder than the Crave 360 at 102 decibels. Like the Crave 360, it also has an Ethernet port. The major tradeoff is that it doesn’t have a built-in battery. Or a strap. Like Sonos, these speakers are designed to team up for multi-room audio over Wi-Fi. You can pair a Crave 360 to other Crave 360s, a Vizio soundbar, or the Crave Pro to crank the same song in several rooms. For that, you’ll need to use Vizio’s SmartCast app to group or separate the speakers. Because it’s designed for multi-room listening, not multi-channel listening, there are limitations to the system. You can’t use each speaker to play individual channels in a surround setup. You can only mirror music on several speakers throughout the house. Perhaps the biggest drawback compared to Sonos is that Vizio’s system doesn’t form a mesh network. As such, the speakers will likely need to be placed in rooms with strong Wi-Fi, and adding a bunch of them to your home network may take a toll on performance. But if a portable, dual Bluetooth/Wi-Fi speaker with multi-room audio skills is what you’ve been waiting for, the Crave 360 is a reasonably affordable fit. It’s available now for $250, while the more-powerful Crave Pro will be out “soon” for $300. Go Back to Top.

Science fiction authors, from Jules Verne to Gene Roddenberry and George Lucas, have made many bold predictions of where our technology may take us, and many of them have come to pass. Here are four technologies from science fiction that exist today. What an exciting time to be alive! 1. Crime Prediction What if law enforcement could stop crime before it happened? That was the idea behind the 2002 film Minority Report, which in turn was inspired by the Philip K. Dick short story of the same name. A trio of mutated humans have the ability to see murders before they happen, and it’s up to a crack team of police officers to stop them. Psychic mutants sit on the most fantastic fringe of science fiction, but maybe the idea of trying to predict crimes before they happen isn’t too far out there. The Los Angeles Police Department has been using big data and predictive analytics to guess when and where a crime might take place. This experiment has borne fruit, and in the areas where the software has been used, there’s been a 33% reduction in burglaries, a 21% reduction in violent crimes, and a 12% reduction in property crime. This is significant when you consider the relatively high crime rate of Los Angeles and the large size of the city. Ads by Google The software is based on those used to predict earthquakes aftershocks. The LAPD has used its record of 13 million crimes committed over the past 80 years. This is used to predict what crimes will occur after another crime has been committed. These predictions are then used when making decisions about planning patrols and assigning officers. 2. Talking Computers From Star Trek‘s Data and the computer, to HAL 9000, and even Her (CA, UK), it has been predicted that one day we would be able to converse with our computers as we would with a friend or a colleague. Although we’re far away from the palpably human experience that some science fiction writers have imagined, we’re getting close. Just check out this device from CommBadge Technologies. You can thank two specific technologies Alexa, How Does Siri Work? Voice Control Explained Alexa, How Does Siri Work? Voice Control Explained The world is moving towards voice commands for everything, but how exactly does voice control work? Why is it so glitchy and restricted? Here's what you need to know as a layman user. Read More for this: voice recognition technology and natural language processing (NLP). The former transforms the analog sound-waves created by your mouth into text. This has existed for a really long time, but for a while the technology struggled with accuracy and efficiency. Now it’s at the point where it can be used to dictate an entire document How Voice Typing Is the New Best Feature of Google Docs How Voice Typing Is the New Best Feature of Google Docs Voice recognition has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years. Earlier this week, Google finally introduced voice typing into Google Docs. But is it any good? Let's find out! Read More — much progress has been made. The latter takes that generated text and then interprets the meaning of it. Modern NLP algorithms are based on machine learning, with many of those algorithms taking advantage of artificial neural networks to determine what the user wants and to learn from previous interactions. The end result of this is that we now have programs like Apple’s Siri The Master List of Every Siri Command and Question The Master List of Every Siri Command and Question Siri can do a lot for you, but did you know she could do this much? Here's an exhaustive list of commands Siri will take.

She knows exactly what I need and has a wicked sense of humour. It's little wonder that I've fallen for the charms of Cortana. Read More , which allow us to ask questions and dictate questions to our phone and actually get a meaningful response. We can even ask follow-up questions to the responses we get and hold something that almost — almost! — feels like a real conversation. 3. Personal Communicators When Captain James Tiberius Kirk was on an away mission and needed to contact the Enterprise, he’d use his trusty communicator. This was a flip device which would allow him to talk in real-time with whoever was left at the helm. At the end of the 1960s, this was utterly unthinkable. But then the 90s came along and gave us flip-phones. These were essentially what Rodenberry had imagined, both in function and in form-factor, but with the added bonus that these could play Snake. Yes, it could be argued that the cell phone is essentially what a Star Trek communicator is. Later series of Star Trek turned the humble communicator from a handheld device to one that was embedded into a badge pinned to a uniform. While we’ve yet to create something as sleek and as good looking as what Picard and Sisko wore, we’re getting there. Other science fiction cannons have imagined what communications technology could be, if only we had advanced a bit more. In Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (CA, UK), for example, Qui Gon Jin used a communicator called a Comlink that was no bigger than a stick of gum. It could be argued that here Lucas was trying to reflect trends at the time for consumer technology to be increasingly miniaturized. Not long after, we saw entire mobile phones fitting into chassis no larger than a car key fob. Indeed, my first Android smartphone — the Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini 10 — was no larger than a box of matches, so perhaps Lucas wasn’t that far off the mark. 4. Food Replicators One of the most ambitious inventions of the Star Trek universe is the matter replicator. This could create — quite literally — anything out of thin air: food, water, clothing, even weaponry. Here’s how Wikipedia explains it: A replicator works by rearranging subatomic particles, which are abundant everywhere in the universe, to form molecules and arrange those molecules to form the object. For example, to create a pork chop, the replicator would first form atoms of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc., then arrange them into amino acids, proteins, and cells, and assemble the particles into the form of a pork chop. Okay, so we’re a long way away from that. But maybe — just maybe — we’ve got something close. Right now, we actually have 3D printers 30 Useful Ways 3D Printing Could Be Used At Home 30 Useful Ways 3D Printing Could Be Used At Home In the future, 3D printers will be as essential in a home as having a smartphone or wireless Internet. Here's a glimpse into the things you can 3D print already to upgrade your home. Read More that can create dishes from recipes using a set of base materials, and the most well-known of these is the upcoming Foodini from the Barcelona-based startup Natural Machines. Foodini’s ambition is to make it as convenient to create healthy meals as it is to shove a pizza in the oven. If one wanted to make fresh ravioli, for example, here’s how it would work: … load the dough and filling into Foodini, and Foodini will print individual raviolis for you. The 3D printing of food — in this case, creating a layer of pasta, a layer of filling, and covering it with a layer of pasta again — is assembling the ravioli. The same as you would do by hand, except Foodini automates it. Another one which has been compared to Star Trek‘s replicator is the Genie. This is a bit harder to explain, so just imagine if your Keurig coffee maker actually cooked you dinner. Pods of healthy, natural ingredients are inserted, and the machine works its magic (no pun intended). We’re far away from the machine Gene Roddenberry thought would end world hunger, but not that far off. Which Sci-Fi Tech Do You Wish Existed?

This means it has a lot of information on you, used by Google for a multitude of reasons like improving its services and bringing up more targeted ads. Not only is everything you search for on its search engine saved, but so too are searches on Google Play, YouTube, Maps, image search, reminders and even voice search. Google saves all of this info so it can serve up more relevant searches and information whenever you use its services, but you always have the option of deleting or turning things off if you wish. To see everything you’ve ever searched for, you need to head over to the My Activity page that is tied in with your Google account. Alternatively, you can go into the My Account dashboard (myaccount.google.com/privacy) and you will find the option there. Here you will see all of the searches you’ve made through Google products as long as you have had an account. For many, this will go back years. While you can scroll through all the results chronologically, you can also search for results by type. So if you’re a fan of using Google Now, specifically its voice searching, you can select that and play back the audio clip of you speaking. Sometimes it will include a transcript of what you said, but you need to have been speaking clearly for it to understand. Source: Google The full list of services you can search for specifically include: Ads, Android, Books, Chrome, Finance, Goggles, Help, Image Search, Maps, Maps Timeline, News, Now, Play, Search, Shopping, Video Search, Voice & Audio, and YouTube. If you want Google to remove them or stop keeping a record of all of these, you can. If you click on the options icon at the top right hand corner (the three horizontal dots), you can delete them by going into Delete Activity By and choosing the relevant timeframe. Alternatively, you can search for a specific thing like Maps and delete them by clicking the options menu in the search bar. The option Delete Results will appear here. On the same menu, you can go into Activity Controls and turn off the settings for different services. The first option, Web & App Activity, deals with searches but you might also want to disable Maps, YouTube and voice search as well.

When it comes to what may be the most important business resource of the 21st century — cloud services — there can be no doubt that AWS is clearly dominating the market. Everyone else is years behind in functionality, ease-of-use and price, and for many, if not most, workloads, AWS is literally better, faster, and cheaper than its competitors. However, although it looks like “cloud means Amazon”, we should resist the temptation to conclude that the cloud war is over. We’ve only seen the initial skirmish, and the most valuable company in the world is about to step up. Google is escalating its cloud offering with GCE, while Microsoft, IBM, and a few other players are simultaneously getting ready for what they no doubt view as the ‘Contest of the Century’. We all win if we stay neutral, allowing them to duke it out as cloud computing becomes increasingly commoditized. Simultaneously, a battle is brewing between those who use these services (which, before too long, will be just about everybody). The losers will go with proprietary solutions from cloud providers and the winners will pick solutions that run everywhere AND leverage the best of each. Google Gets Serious, it’s On! Has AWS’s success awakened a sleeping giant? Google is getting serious, evidenced by its appointment of board member Diane Greene, co-founder of VMware — who had been for years been telling the company that it was missing a big opportunity — as head of Google Cloud Platform. Such keen interest from a company with possibly the world’s largest computing network illustrates the sheer scale of the war for a market that may grow to hundreds of billions of dollars in the next few years. Here’s a quick and dirty recap of the contest: AWS is of course the undisputable top dog, with a million+ customers, 2015 revenues of $7 billion range, companies like Netflix running their entire infrastructure on their services, and a frighteningly huge portion of the world’s web activities run through their servers. Microsoft, led by a CEO who once oversaw its cloud computing unit, is taking square aim at AWS and sits in second place with a pitch that emphasizes enterprise-readiness. IBM takes the number three spot, playing up such angles as hybrid integration and cognitive computing, while Google takes number four and appears to be positioning itself as the cloud provider for Big Data. The growing list of heavyweight contenders also includes HP, AT&T, and Oracle (although Oracle comes with pretty unique baggage). Of course, these companies have their disadvantages too, and no doubt we’ll see them playing to their competitor’s weaknesses, as well as their own strengths. Retailers view Amazon as a competitor, while Microsoft (and Oracle) have reputations for bullying. And all face very valid concerns about vendor lock-in. Play the Cloud Field by Keeping Your Options Open All of these companies are growing their cloud businesses ridiculously fast. But, that’s partially because there’s still plenty of business to go around–everyone hasn’t adopted cloud computing yet. Now that cloud computing has become ubiquitous, the only way for any of these companies to gain serious market share is to take it from a competitor. And we’re already seeing some positive effects from the intense competition … like a kinder, gentler Microsoft? The Seattle-based titan, observes Alex Konrad of Forbes, is already shifting its strategy and culture away from pushing a Windows-only world on its customers. He points out that they may very well have read the writing on the wall when they lost Salesforce to AWS. The message was clear: “cool it, you’re not the biggest kid on the block anymore”. But Amazon, he asserts, needs to cool it too, acting “less like a Bezos-driven, ruthlessly effective operation.” Beyond cultural changes, each provider has its sweet spot, and one of the advantages of using multiple vendors is that you’re free to play to their strengths–tapping Google’s speech recognition and maps, or Microsoft’s security, or Amazon’s price and availability. Coca-Cola, for one, is spreading its apps across all three, citing advantages of flexibility, says Konrad.   It also means that you’re avoiding a problem which is often cited as a pitfall of the on-premise world, but that is just as real in the cloud: vendor lock-in. “Most of the big companies I talk to about cloud deployments are leery of putting all their eggs in one cloud basket. They feel that by using more than one cloud provider, they can keep the other provider honest. Most of these companies have faced vendor lock-in before and feel abused by IT suppliers that made it difficult to move to a rival product or even integrate their technology with that of another company,” says Barb Darrow, Forbes. Databases Feel the Gravity of Vendor Lock-In More Than Other Applications While Matt Asay takes a contrarian view to vendor lock-in, asserting that standardizing on a few vendors “makes life easier”, he concedes the wisdom of maintaining some independence. “Buy all the cloudy infrastructure you want from your vendor of choice, but try to keep your data separate.” The temptation to throw all your eggs in one basket, he points out, may be compounded by the fact that the major cloud vendors have been developing their own database services — AWS Aurora, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, and Google’s Cloud SQL, to name only a few. But such proprietary solutions may be worth avoiding, he says, because “gravitational pull” is stronger on the database than other platforms. Once your data is in, you’ll have to reach a pretty high “escape velocity” to get out (and that escape velocity will no doubt include time, resources, and no small amount of buy-in from departments and leadership). This is a pitfall that we’ll likely see many companies encounter in coming years, as people struggle to determine best practices for optimizing their businesses in the cloud. Nevertheless, it’s one that can largely be avoided by choosing databases that are deployable in any environment–whether it be in the cloud, or on-premises. By doing so, you’ll lower your escape velocity significantly, and achieve the same kind of portability at the database layer, which you have with other cloud-based web applications. And thus you retain the freedom to experiment with the various goodies that AWS, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and others are bound to offer.

 This Bill Gates-backed tech startup is on a mission to fundamentally change the way scientists work Sam Shead Sep. 10, 2016, 3:24 AM 3,410 facebook linkedin twitter email print ResearchGate CEO Ijad Madisch. ResearchGate Meet Ijad Madisch. He's a Berlin-based entrepreneur on a mission to change the way scientists go about their research. The computer science graduate and qualified doctor set up a company called ResearchGate in 2008 when he realised that scientists were making the same mistakes over and over again as a result of not sharing their work publicly. "It's one of the biggest problems we have in the world, especially if we are repeating mistakes made by other scientists that cost us a lot of time and money," Madisch told Business Insider. ResearchGate can be described as a social network for scientists. It started off as a free-to-use platform for academics but it's become increasingly popular with scientists working in corporates, including tech firms like Google and Facebook. There are currently 1,145 Google employees registered on the platform and 199 Facebook employees. In total, ResearchGate boasts over 10 million users. "ResearchGate has become the biggest and most active scientific social network in the world over the last couple of years," claims Madisch. "From the beginning, the focus was on convincing scientists to share publication data." The company claims not to have any competitors but it's worth noting that it was compared to London's Mendeley and San Francisco's Academia.edu in a Times Higher Education article that was published in April. Tackling the world's big problems with online 'Projects' Over the last eight years, tens of millions of pieces of scientific information have been uploaded onto ResearchGate's platform and today more than two million scientific publications are uploaded every month. In addition to publications, scientists are also uploading general articles, conference papers, and raw data. Now the company wants to make it even easier for scientists to collaborate on chunky problems like climate change and illnesses like HIV and cancer. Scientists aiming to tackle meaty issues like climate change are using ResearchGate's platform to share updates. Michael Kappeler/Reuters "Recently we launched a 'Project' feature where scientists can collaborate in real time and document what they have found within the experiment," said Madisch. "I envision a different way of publishing and documenting science in the future where you’re not going for results any more in larger articles but rather in way smaller updates where you don’t have to write the same things again and again." The Projects allow ResearchGate members to talk directly to the scientists running the experiments, possibly giving them feedback and making suggestions in the process. "Ultimately, the Projects give us a way to structure science better," said Madisch, before going on to claim that they also make it easier for scientists to find similar studies to those that they're working on themselves. More than 140,000 Projects have been launched since the feature went live approximately five months ago, Madisch said, adding: "This is a total new direction." One ongoing Project includes Nasa scientists who are using ResearchGate's platform to document their time in an isolated bubble on the side of a volcano in Hawaii, where conditions are designed to replicate those found on Mars. The isolated bubble on a volcano in Hawaii where Nasa scientists are aiming to replicate conditions on Mars. Cyprien Verseux/Nasa While in the bubble, the scientists' internet access is highly restricted but ResearchGate is one of the few websites they are able to use to share what they’re working on. Other ResearchGate Projects are aiming to tackle everything from avian influenza (bird flu) and malaria, to obesity and 3D-printing. More than 200 employees As ResearchGate's userbase has ballooned, the company's workforce has been forced to expand, with the headcount more than doubling over the last year from around 100 to 250. The growth of the company has been fuelled by investors who believe in the ResearchGate mission. A scientist pours samples into a tube. Cyprien Verseux/Nasa The size of ResearchGate's initial fund raises were not disclosed but the company raised $35 million (£26.3 million) in July 2013 in a round that was lead by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates and venture capital firm Tenaya Capital. But it hasn't always been easy for ResearchGate to raise money. ResearchGate is free to sign up to and company's path to monetisation was called into question by early investors. In 2008 and 2009, VCs were asking Madisch how he planned to make money. "I said: 'Hey guys, you don’t get it. If this thing is going to be successful, if we change how scientists think — something that is way harder than making money with this network — then the potential is big.'" That said, ResearchGate is now making money from selling job recruitment space to companies and individuals who want to tap into the company's intelligent network. "We have 2,500 different institutions who have posted a job on ResearchGate," said Madisch. ResearchGate is also thinking about launching "a marketplace for lab services and lab equipment," according to Madisch, who says the market is worth $30 billion (£23 billion) in the US alone. Another one of the company's investors is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and former Facebook VP Matt Cohler, who is now general partner at Benchmark. "He (Cohler) didn’t ask how I wanted to make money," said Madisch. "He asked me what my personal goal was with ResearchGate and I said I want to win the Nobel Prize and he understood that." While many startups are look to exit when they get to a certain size, ResearchGate plans to play the long game. "Our plan is ultimately to stay independent," said Madisch.

The Gmail app is installed on almost every device — it’s fast, easy to use, and on the whole, it makes email about as painless as it’s ever going to be.Makeuseof | Sep 10, 2016, 12.10 PM IST Gmail is the go-to email service for many Android (CA/UK) users. The Gmail app is installed on almost every device — it's fast, easy to use, and on the whole, it makes email about as painless as it's ever going to be. But with a hidden feature here or a settings tweak there, it's possible to get even more out of the app. Here are nine features in Gmail for Android that you may not have known about but should definitely be using. 1. View your unread messages We're not all efficient enough to adopt the Inbox Zero approach to email where you sort and respond to incoming mail straight away in order to keep your inbox as empty as possible. For those of us with rather more cluttered inboxes full of read and unread mails going back weeks and months, a button in the Android Gmail app that enabled us to see just the unread messages would be perfect. But until Google adds one, there is a workaround. Tap the search icon and type is:unread. And that's it — you'll now see only those emails you haven't yet opened. There's no way to save the search, but if you use it often enough, it will remain near the top of your recent searches list and never be more than two screen taps away. You can get even more specific by adding search terms as well. For example, in:unread vacation will show only unread emails containing the word vacation. The is: Operator works with other message types too, like is: Starred or is: Important. It's just one of many operators that enable you to search much more effectively. 2. Smarter searching Gmail uses a huge number of operators that give you the power to create very specific searches. Google maintains a full list of them on its website. You'll never need to use many of them — searching the message-id header, for instance — but a number are genuinely useful. Here are some of the highlights: from:[name], to:[name], cc:[name] — Search for a sender or recipient. +[word], -[word] — Match or exclude specific words. after:[yyyy/mm/dd], before:[yyyy/mm/dd] — Search for mail sent or received before or after a certain date. older_than:[time], newer_than:[time] — Search for mail older than, 2d (two days), 3m (three months), 4y (four years), etc. has:attachment, filename:[filetype] — Search for any attachment, or those of a specific file type. Again, adding search keywords makes the searches more specific, and operators can also be combined. newer_than:7d has:attachment report will search for emails containing the word report, with attachments, that were sent within the last week. Google also uses similar operators with its main search engine, in case you want to play around with those too. 3. Control with gestures The Gmail app doesn't have too many gestures to learn, but the ones that are there are useful. You can quickly read all your emails by opening one and then swiping left, like you're turning the page of an ebook, to view each subsequent message. This works in every view, from the inbox, to labels, to a search results page. You can also clear messages from your inbox by swiping them away. By default, swiping a message in the inbox will archive it (you can set it to delete in Settings if you prefer), while swiping a message from a particular label view will remove said label and archive the email. 4. Select multiple messages You probably know that you can select multiple messages in your inbox by long pressing on one then tapping others. But you can also select emails simply by tapping the colorful circle to the left side of them, allowing for super quick multi-selecting. Those circles can be hidden in the settings, and if you do that, you can then select multiple messages by long pressing with multiple fingers at the same time. 5. Format your mail When you're emailing from your phone, you'll often want to just knock out a quick message without worrying too much about presentation. But if you do want to use formatting to add emphasis or structure to your words, you can. There are basic formatting options in the Gmail app, but they're a little tucked away. To access them, long press in the compose window when you're typing an email and select Format. A formatting bar will open, giving you these options: Bold Italic Underline Text color Text background color Clear formatting They're only basic options, but much more would likely be overkill. Unfortunately, they can't be used to style up a signature you create in the app. 6. Mute conversations If you use the Gmail app for work or any kind of group situation, it's likely you'll often find yourself being cc'd in an initial email for reference, then copied in every single reply, even when you're not part of the conversation. It clutters your inbox and risks overloading you with notifications. Gmail has a handy method for dealing with this. Open one of the messages in the conversation, tap the three dot menu button and select Mute. Muting a conversation means that all future replies will bypass your inbox and be automatically archived. It only applies to that specific conversation thread, and you'll still see other incoming mail from the same people. 7. Let it learn Gmail uses machine learning to help you organize and make sense of your email. This happens through both the Priority Inbox — which you can turn on in the Gmail app by going to Settings > [your account] > Inbox type — and the Important folder. The service learns what is important through various factors including who the sender is, what you read, reply to, archive, or delete. It improves automatically over time, but you can help it on its way with a little manual fine tuning. If a message is wrongly marked as important (as in, the yellow importance marker is checked beside an unimportant message), open the message, then hit the three dot menu button, and choose Mark as not important. Similarly, you can mark messages as important if they haven't been. 8. Add non-Gmail accounts Android devices famously ship with two email clients: one for Gmail and one for everything else. That no longer needs to happen as Gmail can handle email accounts from other services. Open the app, slide open the sidebar, and tap the dropdown arrow next to your account name. Select Add account. There's support for Exchange accounts, along with Microsoft and Yahoo webmail, and you can manually configure any other POP or IMAP account too. 9. Share an email with other apps It's easy to save important emails by tapping the star icon next to them. You can find them later by opening the Starred folder. But what if you want to save an email to somewhere like Evernote instead? You can do that by long pressing on a word within a message. Little blue tabs will appear on either side of the word, so drag them apart to highlight all of the text you want to save. Then select Share from the little menu box that opens just above, and choose the app you want to save it to. You can save the text to Evernote, post it on Slack, copy it into a document, or use it in any other compatible app. (Source: Makeuseof) RELATED From around the web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia From Around the Web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia Comments Sort By:Up VotedNewestOldestDiscussedDown Voted Characters Remaining: 3000 OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION Share on FacebookShare on Twitter SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

(SGW) (otcqb:SGLDF) http://www.shoalgames.com ("the Company"), owner of Trophy Bingo (http://www.trophybingo.com), a mobile game live in the Apple, Google and Amazon App Stores, and Garfield's Bingo, currently in production and scheduled for a Q4 2016 release, today announced it is entering into a licensing arrangement with Rooplay Inc. to commercialize its innovative cloud-based gaming platform and consumer brand Rooplay. Initially developed in London, UK, the technology platform will be advanced by Shoal Games to prepare a unique product for launch in 2017. According to TechNavio cloud gaming will experience a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 29.33% during the period 2016-2020. Shoal Games will release more information on the development of its cloud gaming initiative in the coming months. As part of the terms of the agreement, the co-founders of Rooplay, John Streit and Amir Shadmand, will assume advisory roles in Shoal Games to assist in the advancement of the technology and the launch of the product. John Streit has over 17 years of technology leadership, strategy, project management, technical architecture and digital production expertise. Until recently, John was the CTO OgilvyOne worldwide, London where he led local and dispersed teams of more than 100 members in the development and delivery of software applications to large commercial organisations. Amir Shadmand holds a PhD degree in mobile telecommunications from the King's College London where he received a number of awards and grants in his research. Amir is an expert in mobile cloud gaming technologies and is the co-founder and CEO of SUPENTA, the makers of Flitchio which is the world's first smartphone case with a built in game controller. "With the addition of Rooplay, Shoal Games will have three upcoming product launches, in addition to Trophy Bingo, and the team is excited," commented Jason Williams, the Company's CEO. "The first launch, Garfield's Bingo in English, Spanish, and Portuguese (Brazilian) will arrive in the App Stores in just a couple of months. Garfield's Bingo will be a first for mobile bingo games as no other bingo game features such a world-renowned brand ambassador. We anticipate bingo players will be excited to engage with Garfield, Odie, and the rest of cast in a challenging bingo-puzzle adventure. Second to market will be Garfield's Bingo China which provides an immense opportunity for Shoal Games to leverage the Garfield brand in a new region and distribute a proven product to the millions of Garfield fans in the country. Third to market will be Shoal Games' entry into the cloud gaming space with Rooplay. Rooplay will provide an additional strategic option for the Company in a burgeoning and exciting market. Myself, and the entire Shoal Games team are thrilled to have three new products entering the market in the coming quarters each with the potential to amplify our revenues and put Shoal Games into a strong financial position." The Company's primary focus remains the development and growth of its mobile free-2-play bingo platform. Trophy Bingo has been live in the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Amazon App Store for 12 months and has received more than 600,000 downloads generating over CAD $500,000 in gross revenue and more than 10,000 player reviews averaging a strong 4.4 on Google Play. Trophy Bingo has achieved these milestones because Shoal Games has built a robust game platform with industry leading monetization and retention features. Garfield's Bingo, built on the same mobile platform as Trophy Bingo, is scheduled for release in early Q4 2016. The significance of the Garfield license lies in the global popularity and recognition of the Garfield brand. Brand licenses of Pokemon, Star Wars, Marvel Heroes, and more, have helped to propel new mobile game releases into the Top Downloads and Top Grossing charts many times to date. Garfield (like Pokémon) has launched many products around the world and Garfield's Bingo will be ideally positioned to capitalize on the brand power of the famous cat. With over 200 million readers worldwide, Garfield is one of the most recognizable brands in existence. Garfield is close to ubiquitous in large countries such as America, Mexico, and Brazil. Shoal Games will be positioning Garfield's Bingo to climb the charts in each of these countries, and more, from its initial launch in Q4. One country that is particularly infatuated with Garfield and presents a unique opportunity for Shoal Games, is China. As China is one of the world's most buoyant mobile games markets, the Company is developing a bespoke version of Garfield's Bingo for launch in China in early 2017. Another Garfield game, Garfield Chef, launched in China in early 2016 and has received over 6,000,000 downloads to date. Shoal Games is seeking to engage a local distribution partner to launch Garfield's Bingo in the region. The opportunity to distribute Garfield's Bingo in China, and dozens of other large countries around the world, is immense and Shoal Games' management intends to maximize the potential of the Garfield brand to speed distribution. Additionally, Shoal Games has begun a re-structure of its development personnel in order to maximize the efficiency of the teams creating Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo, and Rooplay. Under the guidance of Shoal Games' new VP of Development, Kirsten Forbes, the in-house teams will share programming, art, design, production and analytics resources to collaborate in a way that will ensure the Company's product development milestones are met. Kirsten has been making games since 1997. As Executive Producer at Radical Entertainment she made AAA console titles, shipping 11 high-profile games including CSI and Crash Bandicoot. Following Radical, Kirsten co-founded Silicon Sisters Interactive, Vancouver's first female led game development studio, where she shipped three premium titles. Prior to Shoal Games, Kirsten was VP Product Development at Roadhouse Interactive. Shoal Games Ltd. also announced today that it has entered into a Line of Credit and Loan Agreement (the "Agreement") with Pendinas Ltd. ("Pendinas") and Mr. Tarrnie Williams, the Company's Executive Chairman for the provision of up to $5.0 million USD. The Company may draw upon the facility in increments as needed for the support and development of Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo, new business initiatives, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on outstanding advances will be charged at the Bank of Canada's prevailing rate plus two percent. No bonus shares or other securities are issuable under the Agreement. Pendinas and Mr. Williams are principal shareholders of the Company. About Shoal Games Ltd. Shoal Games Ltd.

While that represented a growth rate of 66.6% year-over-year, the sub total is also a drop in the bucket of the pay TV market.   “For those keeping score at home, that’s a little less than seven one hundredths of one percent of the U.S. video market,” Moffett wrote.   Update: Google Fiber responded to the report by saying it's "very pleased" with the progress it’s making on the TV front and that it is continuing to expand into multiple cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte and Salt Lake City   Kansas City, Mo., is Google Fiber’s largest TV market, with 42,050, subs, followed by Kansas City, Kan. (21,038); Provo, Utah (2,597); and Austin, Texas (2,812). Moffett also estimates that it ended the period with a mere 218 video subs in Stanford, Calif.   Those numbers don’t factor in high-speed Internet subs. Based on a report in The Information that Google Fiber had 200,000 broadband subs at the end of 2014, Moffett estimates that, if video penetration and broadband remained constant at 15%, Google Fiber would have had about 453,000 broadband customers by the end of June 2016.   That represents “a little less than one half of 1% of total broadband subscribers in the U.S.,” Moffett wrote, while also pointing out that Google Fiber, at least in recent years, had been offering a “free” 5 Mbps service in exchange for a $300 installation fee.   “From the beginning, we’d heard that this offer accounted for a very large share of their business (a couple of years ago, competitive intelligence estimates from their competitors in Kansas City put the number at about a third of all connections),” the analyst said.   And if this “shockingly low video attach rate is correct” (Google Fiber has yet to supply sub numbers), then the unit’s “economics must have been even worse than we had imagined” and could explain a recent report that Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has been pulling back on plans to roll into new markets.    The Information reported recently that Google Fiber is being pressured to cut back staff by half while it also looks into potentially less expensive, high performance wireless broadband technologies that might also help to accelerate the rate of service deployments. Google has not confirmed the report of staff cuts. Given some friendly estimates and assumptions that all of Google Fiber’s subs also take broadband along with one-third getting the free Internet offering, Moffett sees Google Fiber’s annualized run rate, based on June 2016 numbers, at about $300 million in revenue – or 0.3% of Google’s overall business.   “It’s hard to argue with the idea that after nearly seven years of pushing a rock uphill, having just three tenths of one percent of your business to show for it might be a bit discouraging,” Moffett said .   Google Fiber doesn’t break out its individual revenues, but it is part of “Other Bets,” the unit of Alphabet that includes Google Fiber and other longer-term “moonshot”  projects. Other bets ,generated Q2 revenues of $185 million, up from $74 million a year ago, while operating losses widened to $709 million, from $555 million.   Moffett also cited data from the NTIA/FCC showing that Google Fiber passings declined in the second half of 2015.   While fresher data isn’t currently available there, [t]hat kind of deceleration is a clear surprise given the amount of press Google has gotten,” Moffett said.   Want to read more stories like this?

Project Fi's app APK strongly suggests that Google is expanding its wireless service to include group and family plans.

Because it's fast, cheap and easy How to stay connected while traveling with cheap and easy mobile access Businesses brace for cost-cutting measures as the use of wireless data expands Video Rapid review: Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod Project Fi may finally let you bundle multiple friends and family members into one group wireless plan. According to Android Police, which dug into the latest Project Fi app’s APK, there are several references that allude to a forthcoming family plan. There’s no set launch date, but the work is clearly underway since it’s hiding in plain site in the latest version of the Project Fi app. Why this matters: Project Fi is Google’s strange but intriguing take on wireless service. You need a Nexus phone, which is engineered to bounce between Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and open Wi-Fi networks for service. The service is pretty cheap with data costing only $10 per GB, but the lack of any type of group plans and limitation to Nexus phones has made it impractical for most consumers. Finally, group plans are coming  The first piece of evidence is the most obvious: Several pieces of code string refer to a “group plan.” There’s a main account that gets control over data allowances. Since Fi lets you choose a bucket of data each month, presumably you’d be able to parcel out a gigabyte here and there depending on individual needs. Other hints in the code reveal that the usual parental control found with the mainstream carriers, such as usage alerts and the ability to cut the cord on the flow of data, will be present as well. You can even toss someone off your plan and send them on their own. Google has slowly been making moves to make Fi more appealing, as this summer it ramped up international coverage to include LTE and added U.S. Cellular as a domestic carrier partner. I used Project Fi this summer when visiting the Netherlands, U.K., France, and Ireland and found it to be a great experience. Data was fast, with LTE in most locations, and phone calls were surprisingly clear. But the lack of any type of group plan has meant it’s a no-go for me as a regular service, as I’m sure is the case for others. Is Google serious, or just experimenting? Google has never provided any subscriber numbers, so it’s difficult to tell if this is still all some grand experiment designed to nudge the wireless industry into more liberal data usage or to gain insights into how people use their phones. Family plans could convince a few tech-savvy users like me to make the leap, but the other major roadblock is the limitation to Nexus phones. Google would need to partner with other hardware makers to make them Fi-ready. We haven’t heard any buzz about that, and it’s unlikely the company would be eager to invest the resources for what is likely a network with very low usage. But if Google would expand beyond Nexus, it’d certainly be a more viable option. Yet, while Google may be building out Fi’s capabilities now, it wouldn’t be shocking if one day it pulled a Project Ara and shut the whole thing down. One likely place to learn more about Fi’s plans is at Google’s rumored hardware event in October, where we should see new phones, Google Home, and a 4K Chromecast. It’d be an ideal place to proclaim new Fi family plans just in time for those glimmering new phones.

21:15 ET Share this article BALA CYNWYD, Pa., Sept. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Law office of Brodsky & Smith, LLC announces that it is investigating potential claims against the Board of Directors of Apigee Corporation ("Apigee" or "the Company") (Nasdaq- APIC-News) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of state law in connection with the sale of the Company to Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. ("Google"). Click here to learn more about the investigation http://brodsky-smith.com/1117-apic-apigee-corporation.html, or call: 877-534-2590. There is no cost or obligation to you. Under the terms of the transaction, Apigee shareholders will receive only $17.40 in cash for each share of Apigee stock they own. The investigation concerns whether the Board of  Apigee breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders and whether Google is underpaying for the Company. The transaction may undervalue the Company and would result in no real gain for many Apigee shareholders. For example, the premium being paid to Apigee shareholders is below the premium paid in comparable transactions and represents no real increase above the Company's recent initial public offering price. In addition an analyst has set a $19.00 per share price target for Apigee stock. If you own shares of Apigee stock and wish to discuss the legal ramifications of  the investigation, or have any questions, you may e-mail or call the law office of Brodsky & Smith, LLC who will, without obligation or cost to you, attempt to answer your questions.

As if that wasn’t enough to get webmasters off their chairs and start moving their websites to more secure encryption protocols, Google has announced their next move. Starting in January 2017, Google’s Chrome browser will start to mark HTTP websites as “Not secure”, meaning that visitors to HTTP websites will be alerted by this. Granted there could be nothing wrong with the website, but it sounds like Google wants users to know that there are steps that the website could have taken to get itself a secure rating. According to Google, “Studies show that users do not perceive the lack of a ‘secure’ icon as a warning, but also that users become blind to warnings that occur too frequently. Our plan to label HTTP sites more clearly and accurately as non-secure will take place in gradual steps, based on increasingly stringent criteria. Starting January 2017, Chrome 56 will label HTTP pages with password or credit card form fields as ‘not secure,’ given their particularly sensitive nature.” Google also notes that eventually HTTP websites will be given the red triangle warning indicator which should stand out more. Given Google’s reputation as pretty much the web’s de facto search engine, hopefully these changes will prompt webmasters to start thinking about their website’s security. Filed in Web.

Look up and the sky is yellow with smog. While China can be ultramodern, the industrial era is ever-present. Stepping inside the arena is like fast-forwarding 100 years. Some 15,000 technology professionals sit waiting in the packed air-conditioned arena. Soft, anywhere-in-the-world music plays through a flawless sound system getting everyone in the mood. The audience flew in from all over the globe to hear the latest on cloud computing. Later, sessions will run on creating state-of-the-art university networks and building smart cities. Blue skies indoors At the front of the hall, a giant video screen the size of a tennis court shows clouds in a blue, blue sky. A second screen, or series of screens, extends the giant display across the ceiling. Further screens relay images to those sitting too far away or in awkward corners. Next door an expo shows virtual reality tools, open source software and 3D printing. There is more, much more, about modern enterprise computing. This is Shanghai, China in the year of our internet 2016. From the airport you get to the city on a maglev train tipping the speedometer at over 300 kph. Once there you may see workers pedalling ancient push bikes pulling huge trailers. Contrasts, contradictions and anachronisms are everywhere. At times even dull everyday technology impresses. Our conference hotel offers free, unlimited Wi-Fi throughout the building. Speeds are not the fastest, it manages a symmetrical 10 Mbps all day long. That’s better than you get in many New Zealand hotels. Mobile networks are everywhere and deliver decent speeds. New Zealand technology users may notice the public wi-fi network based on telephone kiosks. Just like home. Broken internet Despite the modernity, the urge to embrace technology, China’s internet feels broken. You can get a fast net connection in seconds from almost everywhere. Google, Facebook and Twitter, to name three popular global services are off-limits. Shanghai, like the rest of mainland China, sits behind a series of network controls. Some call these controls The Great Firewall of China. There’s more to the Chinese cyber police than blocking popular international services. They watch Chinese internet users. That may include foreign journalists assigned to technology conferences. There is constant filtering and more direct censorship of material. Internet companies in China censor material on their own networks before it gets out. That saves time and money. Once in the wild subversive traffic could become a problem for the service providers. Net professionals are subject to regular government directives. Snoops sniff data packets, including the ones bringing you these words. The idea is to look for harmful foreign influences — this post probably doesn’t qualify. Crude start At first the Great Firewall was crude. On an earlier trip it blocked entire web domains if there was any suspicion of anything untoward. Today, the blocking is more subtle. The Great Firewall lets some sites through with only certain, troublesome pages censored. One change in recent years is the way the firewall blocks sites of interest to foreign users. Last year, on a trip to Shenzhen in Southern China, it blocked Google’s search engine and the Gmail web page. At the time it was still possible to reach the Gmail IMAP servers and load messages into a mail client. This trip, the Gmail IMAP server is inaccessible. Or at least more inaccessible than before. Now you can’t connect to the server from a laptop or a device reaching the internet through hotel wi-fi. It is still sometimes possible to reach Google’s IMAP server from an iPhone connected to the China Mobile network. Inconsistent This lack of consistency is a feature of dealing with the Great Firewall. Virtual private networks are a popular workaround for foreign journalists filing stories from China. Others use proxy servers. If you were a local and used VPNs a lot, you might attract someone’s attention. Then again you might not. No-one seemed concerned about visiting journalists using VPNs and proxy servers. China’s cyber-police have found ways to interfere with VPNs. This story was part written on an iPad Pro with Norton WiFi Privacy - a VPN. As the name suggests, Symantec sells the software as a tool for keeping WiFi traffic safe. It was never designed to beat China’s Great Firewall. It works up to a point. Yet while VPN performance is fine in New Zealand, it’s erratic in Shanghai. Norton WiFi Privacy keeps disconnecting. At times it connects to a server in China, even though that’s not an official Norton option. There are times when the VPN hums along. And times when it has to reconnect every few minutes, then it drops out again and again. It is as if something remote is resetting connections. Rise of the bots I’ve read elsewhere the Chinese government may use machine learning to block VPNs. If so, then in effect, users are fighting against artificial intelligence. Either way, there’s a remarkable level of sophistication. You may be a security expert who can shed light on the techniques used. Feel free to comment below. Working around the Great Firewall is frustrating. Want to check some facts? It’s hard when you can’t use Google and the Great Firewall blocks some newspapers. You have to know exactly what site you are looking for. Typing words into the browser bar may not work as expected. China allows Microsoft’s Bing search engine. It a local, censored version. Often Bing answers appear in Mandarin. That’s helpful for Chinese users, not for most westerners. Shanghai is a town where Google Maps could help you find your way around. It’s possible to find online maps and direction finding tools. They can be erratic and often text that was in western script a moment ago is, next minute, all in Mandarin. There are also strange behaviours with innocuous things like Apple’s iCloud. Files sync between phone, tablet and computer, maybe not at the pace you might expect. A file stored to iCloud on a MacBook in the hotel room may, or may not, sync to your phone for editing elsewhere. Likewise Microsoft OneDrive works; it is not as smooth as it is at home. That's another aspect of the Great Firewall — it often slows the internet. Perhaps it should not be surprising to learn the Great Firewall blocks WordPress. The blogging site is, in a sense, the 21st-century printing press. China doesn’t have a problem with the WordPress software as such. Many hosted sites there use WordPress. Yet it blocks WordPress.com. It wasn’t possible to post or edit this story in China without a VPN. Even then it was tricky with random disconnects. Protection Banning external sites acts as a form of trade protection. Local alternatives to Facebook, Twitter and Goole thrive without foreign competition. That is only a by-product, China’s real purpose is political or ideological censorship. It stops foreign ideas about democracy and freedom from influencing Chinese citizens. The Great Firewall helps squash internal dissent. It means Chinese users only get to see official, sanctioned news reports. Overseas news reports about, say, Chinese leaders’ questionable personal finances never get an airing. In some ways it may be ineffective. Uncomfortable information and dissent can and do exist with or without an open internet. Yet the Great Firewall highlights the power, reach and sophistication of Chinese government control.

Google has agreed to acquire API management company Apigee Corp. for $625 million. It's a move to help customers securely and stably connect to outside applications and services -- and another step in Google's ongoing efforts to make its cloud platform more attractive to enterprises. API management has become increasingly important to companies such as Workiva, a financial reporting software developer and Google cloud customer based in Ames, Iowa. The company aims to expose more of its Wdesk cloud product to be a more extensible and open platform for managing data, but it has had to do much of that in-house. "Anything we can get to help in the areas of security, monitoring, rate limiting -- all those types of features are really helpful to companies like us to expose more application platforms through APIs," said Dave Tucker, Workiva's vice president of engineering. Workiva looked at an early version of a Google API management suite, Google Cloud Endpoints, but found it to be targeted more at mobile clients and somewhat immature. Apigee, on the other hand, provides important capabilities, such as staging and versioning for releasing APIs in a controlled manner, Tucker said. The timing of the Apigee deal is curious, as Google put a reworked Cloud Endpoints into a beta release just last week, with additional language support and improved performance. It's unclear if or how Google plans to integrate the two services. Google API management leapfrogs AWS API Gateway Security, monitoring, rate limiting -- all those types of features are really helpful to companies like us to expose more application platforms through APIs. Dave Tuckervice president of engineering, Workiva Amazon Web Services (AWS) released its own API management suite, API Gateway, a little over a year ago. Like many AWS offerings early in the release cycle, it has limited functionality. Apigee, on the other hand, has been on the market for years and was ranked as a leader in Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for Application Services Governance. "You cannot compare API Gateway with Apigee," said Paolo Malinverno, research vice president at Gartner. "It implements 10% of the functionality of Apigee. You're comparing a shiny new Toyota with a Ferrari." Apigee offers more than API Gateway in a host of areas, including advanced operational polices for API design and analytics, mechanisms for retiring APIs and understanding how to use APIs to add business value, Malinverno said. It also has a sizable list of high-profile customers, including AT&T, Kaiser Permanente, Pitney Bowes, Sears and Walgreens. Many Apigee customers use the technology on premises, so integrating it with Google Cloud Platform and other Google resources will only multiply the potential benefits for customers and allow for improved use cases around internet of things and connections with Android, Malinverno said. "On the surface, it's a big elephant like Google acquiring a little mouse, but the potential is enormous," Malinverno said. Microservices on the horizon With Google's strong support for container-based technologies, it will interesting to see how it implements Apigee to stand up microservices and provide a full-featured API gateway and development portal to its users, said Chris Riley, a founding partner at HKM Consulting LLC in Rochester, Mass. "It's a hell of a lot easier for a singular platform to be the traffic cop," Riley said. "That routing component is really important to the developer who doesn't want to have to worry about all that -- just plug in and go." Google was an early supporter of Docker and offers its own container service on its cloud platform. It also open-sourced Kubernetes, a popular container orchestration tool based on its own internal software. Google said it plans to integrate Kubernetes with Apigee. HKM Consulting is an AWS partner, and Riley works with a client to implement Apigee on premises. One of the reasons potential customers shy away from the service is the high cost, so Google could really expand Apigee's reach if it's able to make it a subscription-based, software-as-a-service offering, Riley said.

A recent Medium post has exposed a Silicon Valley startup for scamming its employees. The startup community response following the post has been a combination of shared experiences and messages of support – so is the behaviour outlined in the article common or a bad actor outlier? Territory wars are brewing among some of the world’s best-known tech giants, as Google gears up to compete with Uber. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Google will be starting a ride-sharing service of its own, running off the company’s Waze app with the intention of connecting commuters going in the same direction for carpooling. How loyal will people be to Uber when there are serious alternatives on the market? How serious is Google about ridesharing? Tune in as CanCon’s podcast crew – Erin Bury, Managing Director of 88 Creative, Patrick O’Rourke, MobileSyrup Senior Editor, Rob Kenedi, TWG’s Entrepreneur in Residence and host of the amazing #smallrooms podcast, and Douglas Soltys, BetaKit Editor in Chief – prepares for Apple’s next tech release, discusses Google’s foray into the rideshare market, and talks about how many warning signs it should take before you realize your startup is up to no good.

Apple's Siri personal assistant is getting a lot smarter in the upcoming iOS 10, but odds are she'll still sound like a computer. Meanwhile, a subsidiary of Google (her creator's rival) is working on an entirely new model for teaching computers to convert text to speech. It's called WaveNet, and Google says it can mimic any human voice while sounding more natural than text-to-speech algorithms available today. WaveNet is based on research from DeepMind, which this week offered an in-depth look at its efforts to synthesize audio signals for more natural-sounding artificial voices. It all starts with convolutional neural networks, the same technology that powers everything from self-driving cars to disease detection. Neural networks also now power some current text-to-speech products, including Siri, which two years ago was rebuilt to take advantage of this form of machine learning. But Siri and her colleagues, like Google Voice Search or Amazon's Alexa, still use a database of short speech fragments that are strung together to form complete words and sentences. The result is a halting, emotionless voice, even if it is understandable. What if instead of using speech fragments, there was a way to efficiently compile pure audio waveforms? Not only would that allow for more natural-sounding speech, but it would also let the computer mimic virtually any sound, including the ability to faithfully reproduce music. DeepMind engineers set to work. At first, they waged an uphill battle thanks to the inherent density of raw audio, which requires more than 16,000 samples a second for a computer to process. But the engineers were at last able to build a neural network that uses real waveforms from human speakers. They sampled each recording to create a probability distribution of utterances—in essence, teaching the computer how to speak like a human. //Related Articles Things to Ask Siri When You're Bored "Building up samples one step at a time like this is computationally expensive," according to DeepSense, "but we have found it essential for generating complex, realistic-sounding audio." The result is remarkable. DeepSense provided samples of its speech capabilities alongside those typically used today, and the difference in inflection, tone, and emotion is immediately apparent. Have a listen for yourself. It's only natural that computers' speech synthesis will become more, well, natural: Google and its competitors have invested significant resources in developing personal assistants. In order for them to catch on, humans need to think of them less as a gimmick and more as articulate, pleasant robots.

But all of those companies are appearing on stage at BoxWorks in San Francisco, in part because they all work with the cloud storage and content services company in one capacity or another. Box works with Microsoft to integrate its products with Office 365, Amazon to host services in different cloud data centers, and IBM on new applications, services and sales. Google is the newest addition to that club -- the two companies announced Wednesday that they're working on storing Google Docs, Sheets and Slides files inside Box. With companies increasingly turning to cloud services to power their businesses, both in terms of end-user productivity and application development, it's becoming increasingly important for tech firms that compete fiercely with one another to also team up, even in areas where they compete. Box Chief Strategy Officer Jeetu Patel said in an interview that the move towards vendor interoperability is the result of a tectonic shift driven by the rise of cloud computing. "The reality is, you will never buy, in the cloud, everything from a single vendor," he said. "And if you do, that's actually a misguided strategy, because you don't need to have least common denominators, because you can assume that there's interoperability between these platforms." It's a shift in the industry that Box is wholeheartedly focused on. The company recently became the first cloud storage provider to announce support for storing Google Docs files outside of Google's cloud services, just minutes after CEO Aaron Levie extolled his company's partnership with Microsoft. In an interview, he didn't see the two partnerships as mutually exclusive, or hurt by one another. "Just as Microsoft is going to partner with Dropbox and Box when they open up Office, we want to be able to give our customers the same kind of choice," he said. "And it's not a sort of thumb on the nose to Microsoft in any sense, because our job is to be a strong platform, and you can't be a platform if you don't integrate with the apps that your customers are using." All of this is a stark contrast from just a few years ago, when the likes of Microsoft and Google fiercely guarded their vertical stacks. Levie said that partnering broadly is the new normal in enterprise software, as more companies try to serve their customers by working together. "I don't think in the future, you're going to be able to differentiate your products because of either partnerships or because of lock-in," he said. "You're going to differentiate your products because of amazing customer experiences, quality of products, usability and the functionality of the product." The same story is starting to play out on the application development side as well. Different companies are partnering with one another to try and make it easier for developers to cobble together a group of services to build an app. It's still early days for all of these partnerships, many of which were announced in the past year and have only just begun to bear fruit. It'll likely be a matter of years to see how each deal shakes out with the way customers choose to buy services, along with which players stick around in the market. But at least for right now, we're in a brave new world where Microsoft and Google will both partner with a company that directly competes with their products. Go figure.

skip to main | skip to sidebar FOSS Patents This blog covers software patent news and issues with a particular focus on wireless, mobile devices (smartphones, tablet computers). Friday, September 9, 2016 Oracle files proposed notice of deposition of Google witnesses regarding discovery misconduct On August 25, Oracle and Google filed sworn statements (and Oracle also filed an objection) regarding Oracle's motion for an Android-Java copyright re-retrial over alleged discovery misconduct and lies to the jury. Judge Alsup then ordered the parties to respond to each other's filings with new sworn declarations, which were due today. To be of service to loyal readers following the case in detail, I have uploaded Google's declaration as well as Oracle's filing (a declaration as well as a proposed notice of deposition of Google witnesses) to Scribd. Unfortunately, I don't have time, at least at the moment, to analyze these documents in detail and share any observations. However, I don't want this to be misunderstood as my positions on the issues in this case or my belief as to the most likely outcome having changed. So I'd like to explain, just quickly: Due to my focus on two app development projects, my blogging has slowed down massively in recent years. For example, this is only my 36th post this year (with more than two thirds of the year already behind us), while I wrote a minimum of 40 posts in any given month of the year 2012. Some slowdown would obviously have resulted from the fact that many smartphone disputes have been settled, but not to this extent. I'm working very hard right now to launch both games (one on iOS first, the other one on Android and iOS simultaneously) before Thanksgiving weekend. Both games are almost feature-complete, with a lot of the current efforts already relating to final touchup and testing. Both have taken much longer to develop than initially planned, but they've also become even better than I would have predicted at the outset--and those were ambitious projects from the beginning. I have to focus as there still is some hard work on my part to be done, though I have recently stopped doing any coding myself. Now, after six years of "smartphone IP wars," there are only two really big cases pending: this copyright case here and the Apple v. Samsung design patent matter. As a right holder who has already invested a huge amount of money as well as "sweat equity" in software development, I care very much about Oracle v. Google, which is no longer really about APIs as much as it is about software copyright in general. As a potential future defendant against trolls, I'm deeply concerned about the prospect of an unapportioned disgorgement of profits over a design patent on a single icon or whatever other design. The Supreme Court will hear Samsung's appeal in a month (one month and two days, to be precise). This is obviously not the time to reduce or discontinue my coverage of that matter. It will be over soon. I guess the decision will even come down before Christmas, or in January maybe. By contrast, Oracle v. Google will take much longer. I honestly can't predict how much time I'll find to comment on it. It could be that I'll somehow manage to find the time to blog about it like in the past, especially because I disagree with 99% of everything else I read about that case, but it could also be that my next post on this case after this one will be my commentary on the final outcome after a settlement or after all appeals have been exhausted. Or anything in between those extremes. Whatever it may be, it has nothing to do with how important this matter is to software developers like me or with what I believe the legally and factually correct outcome should be.

British company DeepMind, which Google acquired for about $533 million in 2014, developed an artificial intelligence called WaveNet that can mimic human speech by learning how to form the individual sound waves a human voice creates, it said in a blog post Friday. In blind tests for U.S. English and Mandarin Chinese, human listeners found WaveNet-generated speech sounded more natural than that created with any of Google’s existing text-to-speech programs, which are based on different technology. However, WaveNet underperformed recordings of actual human speech. Many computer-generated speech programs work by using a large data set of short recordings of a single human speaker, then combining these speech fragments to form new words. The result is intelligible and sounds human, if not completely natural. The drawback is that the sound of the voice cannot be easily modified. Other systems form the voice completely electronically, usually based on rules about how the certain letter-combinations are pronounced. These systems allow the sound of the voice to be manipulated easily, but they have tended to sound less natural than computer-generated speech based on recordings of humans, DeepMind said. WaveNet is a type of AI called a neural network that is designed to mimic how parts of the human brain function. Such networks need to be trained with large data sets. WaveNet won’t have immediate commercial applications because the system requires too much computational power: it has to sample the audio signal it is being trained on 16,000 times per second or more, DeepMind said. And then for each of those samples it has to form a prediction about what the soundwave should look like based on each of the prior samples. Even the DeepMind researchers acknowledged in their blog post that this “is a clearly challenging task.” Still, tech companies are likely to pay close attention to DeepMind’s breakthrough. Speech is becoming an increasingly important way humans interact with everything from mobile phones to cars. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google have all invested in personal digital assistants that primarily interact with users through speech. Mark Bennett, the international director of Google Play, which sells Android apps, told an Android developer conference in London recently that 20 percent of mobile searches using Google are made by voice, not written text. And while researchers have made great strides in getting computers to understand spoken language, their ability to talk back in ways that seem fully human has lagged. WaveNet is yet another coup for DeepMind, which is best known for creating AlphaGo, an AI system that beat the world’s top ranked human player in the strategy game Go this year. Still, Google has disclosed little about how DeepMind’s research has helped it commercially, although the company has revealed that it has used DeepMind’s technology to reduce the power demands of its data centers by 40 percent, saving enough money to justify the amount Google spent to buy the London AI company. It has also said that DeepMind has helped achieve “substantial improvements to a set of services from YouTube and Google Play to Google’s advertising products.” Jeremy Kahn is a Bloomberg writer.

But what's missing grabbed most of the attention: the headphone jack. On The Late Show, host Stephen Colbert delivered a parody of Wednesday's release, dressed in the style of Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an untucked dark-blue shirt. He took away not just the headphone jack but also the home button, the glass front -- and the back. "We thought, if less is more how much more could we less?" he said. Apple's all-too-serious move to remove the connection to its iconic white earbuds and urge people to use cordless AirPods -- sold separately for $159 -- points to the company's vision of a "wireless future," which could someday extend to home appliances, cars and more. There was other news: Nintendo's Super Mario is coming to the App Store, and you can be part of the Pokémon Go scavenger hunt on a revamped Apple Watch. It was a consumer tech show for sure, with no mention of business. But CIOs should take notice. Even though its iPhone sales have flagged recently, Apple still sells big to consumers -- and those who buy also go to work. "CIOs would be best served by paying attention to what kind of technology their employees like and prefer to use," said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester Research. "But most important, focusing on how mobile can help them, because the business impact is undeniable." Apple-to-apples comparison Irwin Lazar, an analyst at Nemertes Research, said CIOs should think about the new iPhone 7 features and other Apple announcements in digital-transformation terms: "What can we deliver to mobile devices both internally and externally?" he said. The Apple Watch, for example, which comes with a faster, dual-core processor, might be able to run business applications that couldn't be run before. And apps may require tweaking to offer what the new phone has. "If I'm delivering an application that allows people to take pictures of something," Lazar said of a CIO, he or she should "make sure that I can support the enhancement that the camera provides." Overall though, the tweaks Apple introduced were incremental, Lazar said, and won't have as big a business impact as the release of the new mobile operating system, iOS 10. The new version, which will be released Sept. 13, will work with third-party applications like corporate phone systems from Cisco or Microsoft, making it easier for workers to make business calls from their personal devices. Hefty, hefty iPhone 7 But some of the tweaks Apple was proudest of, like the iPhone 7's new "ruggedized" exterior, could prove beneficial in a number of contexts, Voce said, including retail and air travel -- and it will compete well with efforts rivals like Samsung have been doing to make their devices tougher and more resilient to drops and bad weather. "There are scenarios where organizations might use devices in less-than-ideal conditions," he said. "You get on a flight nowadays -- every flight attendant is going to have a mobile device, and it usually has been ruggedized to a certain extent." Apple also debuted real-time collaboration capabilities in its iWork productivity suite -- which includes word processing, presentation and spreadsheet applications. The new feature will allow people working on the same project to contribute images, text or graphics. That may seem like Apple wants a piece of the market segment dominated now by Microsoft, with its Office suite, and to a lesser extent Google, with its cloud-based Apps for Work. But its impact will be primarily in education, not business, Voce said. Making inroads in business would be "extraordinarily difficult." Lazar's forecast: "Most people won't be using iWork in a business context." 'Increased competition' The Apple rollouts may have another, less-direct effect on business, Voce said: It may very likely trigger industry-wide change. The company has "spurred an intensity" in the tech market, Voce said, pushing Microsoft to make its Surface tablet offering easier to use, for example, and Dell to improve its XPS computer line. "What you've seen is that kind of focus on experience has driven the whole industry to raise their game," Voce said. "And as consumers and employees, we benefit. Apple led that charge and the benefit is increased competition." CIO news roundup for week of Sept. 5 The iPhone 7 and other Apple upgrades prevailed in the news this week. Here's what else made headlines: HPE is slimming down. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will spin off and merge its non-core software assets with UK-based technology firm Micro Focus in a deal valued at $8.8 billion, HPE said Wednesday. "With today's announcement, we are taking another important step in achieving the vision of creating a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company well-positioned for our customers and for the future," Meg Whitman, president and CEO, said in a press release. HPE's non-core software assets -- Application Delivery Management, Big Data, Enterprise Security, Information Management & Governance and IT Operations Management -- will combine with Micro Focus' portfolio to help drive software innovation and create a "pure-play" software company, according to the release. HPE shareholders will have a 50.1% ownership of the merged company, and Micro Focus will pay $2.5 billion in cash to HPE. This follows the announcement in May that HPE would merge its IT services business with Computer Sciences Corp. Google plans to acquire Apigee. The search giant said it is set to acquire San Jose, Calif., API management provider Apigee for $625 million. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are used by developers to interface and integrate with outside applications and services, and "the addition of Apigee's API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers' move to supporting their businesses with high-quality digital interactions," said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google Cloud services, in a blog post. The deal is expected to close by end of this year. Apigee was founded in 2004 as Sonoa Systems, and the company went public in 2015. Its customers include Walgreens, AT&T, Burberry and Live Nation. In other Google news, the company announced its partnership with Box on Wednesday. Intel boosts computer vision strategy. In an effort to bolster its RealSense platform, chip maker Intel is acquiring computer vision startup Movidius, Intel announced Monday. Movidius designs system-on-a-chip (SoC) products, and its low-power and high-performance SoC platforms will help accelerate Intel's computer vision applications, said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager at Intel's New Technology Group, in a blog post. "This acquisition brings algorithms tuned for deep learning, depth processing, navigation and mapping, and natural interactions ... and machine intelligence," Walden wrote. Intel will deploy Movidius' vision chip technology in devices like drones and robots, and use it to improve augmented, virtual and merged reality technologies. Mobile device infections on the rise. Smartphones accounted for 78% of infections detected in mobile networks during the first half of 2016, according to a new report by the Finnish mobile phone company Nokia. The report's data was aggregated across the networks where the Nokia NetGuard Endpoint Security solution is deployed. The report found that the smartphone infection rate rose 96% between January and July this year when compared with the second half of 2015. The mobile infections hit an all-time high in April, with malware affecting one out of every 120 smartphones, the report states. Android devices where the most targeted, accounting for 74% of all mobile malware infections. The Nokia Threat Intelligence Report - H1 2016 identified Uapush.A, Kasandra.B and SMSTracker as the top three mobile malware threats, accounting for 47% of all infections.

Add My Comment Cancel   [-] abuell - 10 Sep 2016 7:06 PM I found it interesting that there's some controversy around Apple removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Accusing them of benefiting through the move which could spur more sales of Beats. If you don't like it, there's a easy solution to that: don't spend $650+ on an iPhone. That's just foolishness.  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] ncberns - 12 Sep 2016 8:18 AM News of the non-jack has been unavoidable. Of course if buyers are willing to drop almost a $1000 for a new phone they really don't need, an extra $150 for a new headset (they also don't need) won't mean much. What say we all stand by while Apple dukes it out with all the pro-jack folks until there's a clear winner of this tempest in a teapot "advance".  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] AlbertGareev - 12 Sep 2016 4:40 PM I actually find the news in the absence of truly innovative advances from Apple - for quite a while. Another disappointment is due to a gradual degradation of iOS based software quality. Crashing apps slowly become a norm.

X EU plans to protect news publishers’ online copyright Draft directive aims to safeguard news organisations and journalists from piracy Sat, Sep 10, 2016, 01:00 Peter Murtagh A new EU directive on online copyright may meet resistance from Google. File photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images         News organisations that generate original content will be protected by copyright against information aggregators, as well as unscrupulous online providers who base their service on pirated information, if proposals from the European Commission become law. The proposals are contained in a draft directive that seeks to update an earlier one, Copyright in the EU Digital Single Market, from 2001. The new directive, a late draft of which has been obtained by The Irish Times, proposes to, in effect, give to news publishers the degree of copyright protection that was afforded to authors, performers, the music industry, film-makers and broadcasters in the 2001 directive. The proposal is part of the so-called digital single market strategy that commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has made a priority of his administration. The commission vice-president with responsibility for this area, Andrus Ansip, was in Dublin this week meeting the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and the Dáil’s European affairs committee. The new directive is likely to meet stiff resistance from Google, whose Google News service relies wholly on reproducing information gathered, processed and published initially by news organisations, and by Facebook which sees itself as the world’s information platform but is also based on information originated by others. “There’s going to be a huge pushback from Google and other online platforms, such as news aggregation sites,” predicted Chris Mehigan, a Brussels-based public affairs consultant with Hume Brophy public relations consultants. RTÉ and TG4 need funding increases, says Minister Media pluralism The new directive is an attempt to protect the business viability of news organisations, and also the work of journalists, in the interests of media pluralism and, ultimately, the information available to citizens of EU member states. In an explanatory memorandum to the draft directive, the commission notes that the internet has become “the main marketplace for the distribution and access to copyright-protected content”. However, news media copyright holders “face difficulties when seeking to licence their rights and be remunerated for the online distribution of their works”. ADVERTISEMENT It continues: “This could put at risk the development of European creativity and production of creative content. “It is therefore necessary to guarantee that authors and rightholders receive a fair share of the value that is generated by the use of their work and other subject matter. “News publishers are facing difficulties in licensing their publications online and obtaining a fair share of the value they generate. This could ultimately affect citizens’ access to information. “This proposal provides for a new right for news publishers aiming at facilitating online licensing of their publications, the recouping of their investment and the online enforcement of their rights.” The directive says that news publishers will have the same rights as granted to others in the 2001 directive “for the online use of their news organisations”. Cease service A measure to this effect already introduced by the Spanish government prompted Google to cease its news service for the Spanish market two years ago rather than pay the news organisations there whose content Google proposed to republish. For newspaper publishers watching helplessly as others pirate their material, the draft directive may not be quite the panacea for which they have longed. This is because the new directive also embraces the exceptions and limitations outlined in the 2001 directive. That directive says copyright may not apply in some circumstances to the reproduction of material “as long as the source, including the author’s name, is indicated, or use of works or other subject matter in connection with the reporting of current events”. The draft new directive sets out to establish an important principle, says Mehigan: “If you put a piece up on a news site, especially the work of a columnist, an opinion piece, a piece of substantial original work such as a feature, an interview or an investigation, you have the sole rights of reproduction.” If the draft directive is signed off by the commission on September 21st, it will then go through the European Parliament and the council of relevant ministers from member states where it can be amended and is likely to be the subject of intense lobbying by vested interests.       Topics: Chris Mehigan European Commission European Parliament European Union News organisations Facebook Google Hume Brophy Dublin(IE) Read More News publishers could charge search engines for story extracts Content ‘explosion’ a key focus at MediaCon summit INM talk not of media diversity, but of industry consolidation Independent News & Media acquires six regional newspaper titles Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Criminal Court Gardaí arrived at scene after frenzied attack with ‘boning knife’ Opinion Kathy Sheridan: What can liberals learn from the US election?

The DeepMind unit, which Google bought in 2014 for roughly $533 million, develops supercomputers and artificial intelligence (AI). One of the AI programs DeepMind has developed is Wavenet, designed to mimic human speech.  © Photo: Pixabay Hello Monsters, Goodbye Privacy! Google Maps Timeline and Pokemon Go Pally Up In blind tests human listeners indicated that Wavenet was the most natural sounding text-to-speech (TTS) program, after hearing samples from different programs in English and Mandarin Chinese. TTS programs continue to struggle to sound like natural speech, and Wavenet, while increasingly similar, does not yet sound just like actual human speech. Wavenet simulates certain brain functions by using what in artificial intelligence is called a "neural network." DeepMind has reported that Wavenet is not currently available to purchase as the processing power required to sample an audio signal some 16,000 times per second remains impractical at the consumer level.  Once the signal is sampled, it must predict what each soundwave should look like based on prior samples. In a blog post, DeepMind researchers admit that the undertaking "is a clearly challenging task."  © AFP 2016/ Can Google Tip the Scales on the US Presidential Election Without Anyone Knowing? As people increasingly use speech to interface with technology, from cars to mobile phones, other tech companies are taking note of DeepMind’s advancements. Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet, and Amazon already communicate using speech-based digital personal assistants. At a London developer conference last week, Google Play’s international director, Mike Bennett, revealed that speech commands make up 20 percent of Google searches, as opposed to text searches. Google acknowledged that it has used DeepMind to drop the power demands of its data centers by 40 percent, but has not said much about how the program has impacted the company commercially, if at all. The company has also stated that the AI has made "substantial improvements to a set of services from YouTube and Google Play to Google’s advertising products." Before developing Wavenet, Google also made strides in AI with the AlphaGo program, which was able to beat Lee Sedol, the world’s best player of strategy game Go.  ...

While hard-working people and UK businesses have paid their dues, some of the world’s biggest companies have avoided doing so at a cost of tens of billions of pounds to the UK Exchequer. It is a situation that appals veteran Labour politician Dame Margaret Hodge, former chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee which is charged with ensuring British taxpayers get a fair deal. In defiance of ministers, Whitehall mandarins and vested interests at Westminster, she spent her five years in the role trying to call some of the world’s biggest companies to account. Now, for the first time, she has written a book detailing the inside story of her dogged battle to force firms to come clean about aggressive tax avoidance. It is a story that lays bare the extraordinary lengths they go to in order to keep their cash out of the public coffers — aided by civil servants and senior tax office officials . . . Dame Margaret Hodge as chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee used her five years as the public spending watchdog to hold some of the world's biggest firms to account GOLDMAN SACHS Believe it or not, the reason I decided to haul the bankers from Goldman Sachs before the committee was because I read Private Eye. It was a decision that was to have far-reaching consequences. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Champagne Shifty: What a shower! Shameless pictures taken... Migrant-traffickers are top security threat: Officials warn... Share this article Share Private Eye had run a story about an elaborate tax-avoidance scheme that had been set up in 1997 by more than 20 investment banks and other companies. By using trusts and paying their British staff off-shore, they’d all avoided paying National Insurance in the UK. Eight years went by before HMRC successfully challenged this ruse — and each company then settled and paid up. Except Goldman Sachs. So the taxman went after the investment bank in court, warning that it would face stiff interest payments on the money owing if it lost. Indeed, this is standard practice. Margaret Hodge investigated claims HMRC did a deal with Goldman Sachs over tax they owed However, Goldman Sachs fought HMRC tooth and nail for a further five years. By April 2010, when they lost at a crucial tribunal, they owed £40 million. The Government was now in a strong position to extract all the money from Goldman Sachs, including the interest. But this didn’t happen. Instead, in November 2010, a secret deal was struck between HMRC and Goldman Sachs that appeared to let the bankers off paying the interest due. It was difficult to establish the facts because any information on tax is deemed confidential. As far as we could make out, the taxpayer had lost between £5 million and £8 million of interest payments in what could only be seen as a ‘sweetheart’ deal. How on earth could this be justified? We asked Dave Hartnett, Permanent Secretary for Tax at HMRC, to explain. But he refused to answer any questions on the grounds of confidentiality, claiming that in any case he’d had nothing to do with Goldman Sachs. Dame Margaret admitted she began investigating the scandal after reading Private Eye It seemed that we had hit an insuperable buffer. But just then I received a big brown envelope from a whistle-blower who worked as a lawyer in HMRC. In the middle of the pile I found a crucial document — the minutes of a meeting between the taxman and Goldman Sachs. What they revealed was astonishing. First, those present at the meeting had talked ‘about a deal on which DH [Dave Hartnett] had “shaken hands” with GS [Goldman Sachs]’. But Hartnett had claimed categorically to the Treasury Select Committee that he’d had nothing to do with the firm’s tax affairs. The leaked minutes also stated that ‘the proposed settlement gave GS [Goldman Sachs] no additional penalty for having resisted for 5 more years’. They also revealed that the bank had been let off paying the interest it owed. Most intriguingly of all, they made it plain that the top lawyer at HMRC, Anthony Inglese — who had been present at the meeting — considered the deal struck with Goldman Sachs ‘unconscionable’. So we now had evidence that the head of tax had misled a parliamentary committee, and that HMRC — against its own guidelines — had agreed to a secret sweetheart deal that its own lawyer disapproved of. Of course, we recalled Dave Hartnett. And I accused him of lying. He denied he had lied, saying he ‘did not deal with Goldman Sachs’s tax affairs in the normal sense’. He insisted he had met with the bankers only once — at the meeting where the strange deal was concluded. In fact, we discovered, he had also enjoyed a free lunch, dinner and reception with Goldman Sachs. Worse, Hartnett was not only the principal official involved in negotiating a settlement with the bank, but he’d also sat on the small internal HMRC committee that vetted and rubber-stamped the deal. So what we had here was a wholly secret process, with inappropriate authorisations, utterly inadequate accountability structures, and relationships between top officials in HMRC and powerful taxpayers that seemed far too cosy for comfort. Despite our best efforts, Hartnett would not explain why he had let the bankers pay back less than they owed. At that point, we decided to call Anthony Inglese, HMRC’s head of law — who had apparently labelled the deal ‘unconscionable.’ I simply wanted Inglese to confirm that the leaked minutes of the meeting with Goldman Sachs were an accurate account. But the lawyer refused to answer questions, claiming he owed his allegiance to HMRC — not Parliament. Frustrated beyond measure at what I viewed as a conspiracy of silence, I asked the committee clerk to fetch a Bible and insisted Mr Inglese give the remainder of his evidence on oath. He had no option but to do so — but said very little more. So what has happened since? At HMRC, little has changed. Senior officials continue to insist they cannot discuss the details of taxpayers’ affairs, whether they’re those of an individual or of a company. Does this lack of openness matter? Yes, because the taxman’s actions and decisions cannot be called to account — and taxpayers therefore can’t be sure that they’re being treated equally. There are two important postscripts to this story. Already angry at the way we’d conducted our inquiry, senior civil servants were particularly incensed by my insistence on Inglese giving evidence on oath. And they fought back with full force. First, the Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell wrote me a letter that was highly critical of the way in which we conducted our inquiries. ‘There is now a serious issue about the way you are perceived by the wider Civil Service, but more especially by the legal community,’ he warned — completely ignoring the apparent discrepancies in Hartnett’s evidence. I assumed the letter was private, but quickly found out it had been agreed by all the permanent secretaries and sent to the Clerk of the House of Commons. I replied saying: ‘It is the duty of the committee to pursue fearlessly the public and taxpayers’ interest whenever and wherever we deem it necessary.’ But that wasn’t the end of the matter. The Civil Service, I discovered, went on to commission a survey on what committee members and senior officials thought of our work. Unknown to them, the researcher attached to their project had once worked with me when I was a minister, and she showed me their responses. Some had likened us to the Red Guards; others labelled me an abysmal failure who was ‘ridiculous’ and ‘heavy-handed’. This didn’t bother me: we had to ask uncomfortable questions, so if they’d liked me, I would have been failing in my job. It was the explicit threat in the final paragraph of their report that left me aghast at their sheer arrogance. This roughly translated as: ‘Shut up or we’ll shut you down.’ The true hero of this tale, of course, is the whistle-blower who sent me the crucial brown envelope. Osita Mba had joined HMRC after training as a barrister and demonstrated strong public service values. He should have been commended for that; instead, he was hounded by HMRC, who wanted to charge him for breaking confidentiality laws. Exploiting powers under legislation brought in to tackle terrorists, they cracked open a locked office cabinet beneath his desk; they hacked into his hard drive; they looked at all his emails; they traced his texts and phone calls; they even examined his wife’s phone records. But they never found evidence to charge him. However, they kept Osita Mba off work for a long time; and when he finally came back, they made his life so intolerable that he decided to quit. To this day, my deepest regret from my time as chair of the Public Accounts Committee is my failure to protect a highly principled individual who refused to collude in a cover-up. STARBUCKS For sheer brazenness, Starbucks couldn’t be faulted. The American multinational had been operating in the UK since 1998, expanding its outlets and growing its business. And every year, bar one, the company claimed it was losing money — which meant it avoided paying corporation tax. Yet, through most of that period, Starbucks had also been assuring investors that its UK business was highly profitable. There was clearly one version of events for the investors, another for the UK tax authorities. So, naturally, I wanted to find out how they managed to convert their UK profits into the losses they declared to the taxman. Starbucks began operating in the UK in 1998 but managed to lose money and avoid paying corporation tax during much of that time by routing cash through their Dutch company  There were three devices they used to shift their profits out of the country, I discovered — all of which are commonly used by multi-nationals. First, the company locates its headquarters in a country that demands little or no tax. Then each outlet in the UK has to pay head office a steep ‘royalty’ — a percentage of its earnings — for using the brand and certain business processes. This is what tax professionals call ‘transfer pricing’ — and a huge industry of accountants, lawyers, bankers and advisers has grown up to facilitate it. In Starbucks’ case, they claimed that their HQ was in Amsterdam, even though the firm’s ‘President for Europe’ was actually based in London. But by doing this, they could legitimately do a deal with the Dutch tax authorities that helped them avoid UK tax. Not only were tax rates lower in the Netherlands, but they had a deal with the Dutch that allowed them to transfer money to the tax haven of Bermuda — where no tax was levied at all. Starbucks claimed of every £100 earned in the UK, £6 had to be sent to the Netherlands as a royalty payment. The company also ordered its coffee from Switzerland to pay less tax For every £100 earned at a Starbucks in Britain, it turned out that £6 had to be sent to Amsterdam. Even HMRC thought this was excessive as ‘royalties’ for the brand, and it cut the amount to £4.70. The second device Starbucks used to shift profits out of the UK was to buy all their coffee beans in Switzerland, another low-tax jurisdiction. As we established at a Public Accounts Committee hearing, however, only 30 staff worked there — and the coffee beans never entered Switzerland. Yet because the coffee was ordered from there, Starbucks outlets in the UK had to pay the Swiss part of the business a 20 per cent mark-up on the original price. That cleverly knocked another chunk off Starbucks’ UK profits — and further reduced the amount of corporation tax payable in the UK. Their third wheeze involved intra-company loans. Any UK Starbucks outlet that needed money was forced by the company to borrow from Starbucks in Bermuda or the Netherlands — at an exorbitant interest rate. In effect, this was simply a device to export profits and avoid tax. As our hearing established, these three strategies had managed to turn healthy UK profits into ‘paper’ losses — while the company itself continued to thrive. The public were understandably outraged, and many started boycotting Starbucks coffee shops. The company’s market share began to plummet. It was then that Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks UK, asked to see me. Over a cup of ordinary House of Commons coffee, he told me that Starbucks would voluntarily pay £20 million in corporation tax to the Exchequer. This extraordinary offer simply confirmed my view that the system was broken. Why should Starbucks or any other company be allowed to choose the amount of tax it paid? Surely tax had to be assessed by the tax authorities, not decided on the whims and assessments of the companies themselves? To this day, many people are still boycotting Starbucks. I am myself — and I’ll continue to do so until the company starts paying a fair amount of tax on its UK profits. AMAZON Amazon’s tax arrangements were also mind-boggling. Their particular strategy was to create a complex web of companies. This had one purpose: to convince HMRC that they were not selling goods in the UK, but selling goods from Luxembourg into the UK. They decided to deal with our public hearing by sending a witness who couldn’t answer our questions. Andrew Cecil was their director of public policy. He acted like a nervous rabbit, hesitating with his answers and stumbling over his words. He even claimed not to know the company’s UK sales figures. Amazon also had a complicated tax structure with much of their UK profits routed through Luxembourg by claiming that goods bought here were actually purchased from the continent At the time of our hearing in 2012, one in four books sold in the UK was purchased from Amazon. But Cecil claimed that all the books and other goods bought from Amazon.co.uk were in reality being bought from Amazon’s company in Luxembourg. So what’s in Luxembourg? Not the books and other goods — they’re most likely to be in eight giant warehouses in the UK or possibly in the 20 more across Europe, though customers pay only UK postage rates. In Luxembourg, however, you’ll find only the server for Amazon’s computer. True, 500 people work at the Luxembourg HQ — but this pales into insignificance against the 15,000 employees in Britain. Yet Amazon still continues to claim that no sales take place in the UK — a bogus arrangement that appears to be admissible under international tax rules. It’s well worth it when the UK accounts for around £5 billion in net sales. In 2012, for instance, Amazon’s accounts showed that they’d paid us a risible corporate tax contribution of £2.4 million. That very same year, they received a regional grant from the UK Government for the higher sum of £2.5 million to build one of their warehouses In 2012 Amazon paid £2.4 million in UK corporation tax even though the government offered them a grant of £2.5 million to build one of their large warehouses from a regional fund This was funded, of course, by the UK taxpayer. As far as we could deduce from very opaque figures, Amazon paid only £3 million in UK corporation tax for 2003-2011. During the same time period, the €7.5 billion (£6.34 billion) revenue they filed in Luxembourg didn’t bring much benefit to the people of Luxembourg, either. Amazon claimed their administrative expenses amounted to €7.4 billion (£6.26 billion), leaving them with a minuscule profit. So not only were they telling us that they hadn’t sold anything in the UK, but they appeared to be manipulating their accounts in Luxembourg, too. Amazon also told us that no research and development took place in Britain. This was important, because any suggestion that it did would have undermined their claim that Amazon in the UK was simply providing delivery services for the Luxembourg company. However, one of our committee members, Fiona Mactaggart, happened to be the MP for Slough, where Amazon’s UK headquarters are based. There, she’d been told they were developing new products in the UK. There could be only one conclusion. The structure Amazon had devised, the complex web of companies it controlled, was all about avoiding tax; there was no other commercial purpose. Since our hearing, the EU has challenged Amazon’s tax deal with Luxembourg, and Amazon has announced it is changing its structure. It may even start to pay some tax. But it will continue to hide most of its profits by charging exorbitant fees to UK branches for the right to use Amazon patents. So we’re unlikely ever to get the full tax generated from sales in this country. So what has the UK Government done about all this? It has appointed an Amazon senior executive, Doug Gurr, to the board of the Department for Work and Pensions. Is that really the best we can do? Reward a company that intentionally avoids tax with a top government job as a non-executive director? No wonder people get angry. GOOGLE By contrast with Amazon, the man Google sent to our hearing was unusually open — even somewhat arrogant. Matt Brittin, head of sales and operations in Northern and Central Europe, was quite happy to admit the complex web of companies through which they operated was designed to avoid paying tax. He gave the impression that Google was doing the UK a favour, and clearly had absolutely no intention of expressing any humility or regret about their aggressive tax-avoidance. Like Amazon, Google claimed that they weren’t selling in Britain. Their server was in Ireland, and they were merely selling into Britain. We looked at their figures for 2011. In that year, sales to customers with a UK address amounted to $4.06 billion — or 11 per cent of Google’s business worldwide. Google tried to claim they were not selling in Britain as their European headquarters was in Dublin, however, in 2011 they had sales to UK addresses of $4.06 billion  But the company told HMRC that their sales in Britain were not $4.06 billion (£3.06 billion) but a mere $396 million (£299 million), because the sales were apparently transacted in Ireland. From there, the money went to Google in the Netherlands — through the device of Google Ireland paying a fee for a licence held by Google Holdings Netherlands. The Netherlands Google then passed 99.8 per cent of the money back by paying another fee to another entity in Ireland, called Google Ireland Holdings — which is registered in Ireland, but administered in Bermuda. Confused? I was. It’s precisely this kind of labyrinthine complexity that’s enabled companies such as Google, Amazon and Starbucks to get away with not paying their fair share of tax. Google’s tactics were known in the industry as the ‘Dutch sandwich’ because they enabled the company to avoid both UK corporation tax and Dutch tax. Eric Schmidt, Google’s chairman, openly proclaimed that he was ‘very proud’ of the structure. ‘It’s called capitalism,’ he said. ‘We are proudly capitalistic.’ What did this version of capitalism mean for the British taxpayer? In 2011, the year the UK turnover came to £4.6 billion, they filed losses of £24 million. As a committee, we knew what they were doing was wrong, but there seemed little we could do about it . . . until the whistle-blowers started contacting me. Google's tax strategy was known as a 'Dutch sandwich' as it avoided UK and Dutch tax They were both current and past employees and clients of Google, infuriated by what they felt was misleading evidence given to us by the company. I asked two to come in to see me. Their allegations were serious enough for me to recall Google for another hearing. In a nutshell, they were claiming that Google had been selling in — rather than into — the UK, and was therefore liable for tax. One of the whistle-blowers, Barney Jones, had been employed by Google for four years. From offices in Soho, he’d led a sales team that sold advertising to large UK companies — and he had the documents to prove this. Jones and his team met the clients and their agencies in the UK. The ads were designed by staff based in the UK. The key words that determined the ranking of the advertisements were suggested by UK-based staff. Even the invoices were sent out from London. The other whistle-blower was still working for Google when he met us. As a senior salesman in London, he received bonuses for selling and agreeing deals — as set out on his pay-slips. Later, a third whistle-blower — this time a Google customer — told us that he had been asked to settle his account in sterling with Citibank in London. Not Ireland, you note. So how did Google react to all this devastating evidence? At our initial hearing, Brittin had claimed: ‘Anybody who buys advertising from us in Europe buys from Google in Ireland, from our expert team.’ At the second hearing, he stubbornly stood by those words. He also claimed that there was no substantive research and development activity taking place in the UK. However, we learned from other whistle-blowers that a Google building in Buckingham Palace Road was occupied by hundreds of systems developers. Brittin refused to accept that he had misled the committee. ‘They’re contributing to the development of products, absolutely . . . but the leadership of the products that are being built is in California.’ At The end of one long and frustrating session, I could no longer contain myself. Recalling Google’s own company motto — ‘Don’t be evil’ — I told Brittin: ‘You are a company that says you “do no evil”, but I think you do do evil, in that you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax.’ Not surprisingly, the committee’s unanimous conclusion was that Google was selling in Britain and should pay taxes in the UK. And the British tax authorities? As far as we know, HMRC have yet to do anything about this. Then three years later, Brittin suddenly announced that Google would be paying the UK Exchequer £130 million in tax for the ten years from 2005 to 2015. George Osborne welcomed the announcement as ‘a victory for the Government’. But was it? Google’s offer amounted to £13 million a year over ten years — an effective tax rate of 3 per cent, when every small and medium-sized business was paying 20 per cent corporation tax. This episode confirmed the smug and contemptuous attitude too many multinational businesses have towards the British people. In the past, avoiding tax may have been seen as cool and clever. But I learned from the huge number of letters and emails I received that our investigations had unleashed colossal public anger. David Cameron understood that quite quickly. In his speech to the World Economic Forum in January 2013, he used the Starbucks case to say: ‘There are some forms of avoidance that have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these raise ethical issues and it is time to call for more responsibility and for governments to act accordingly.’ Of course, actions speak louder than words, but I couldn’t even extract the right words from either Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls or Labour leader Ed Miliband. Following our hearings with Starbucks, Amazon and Google, I’d held meetings with the two Eds’ staff and suggested appropriate policies to promote fairness in the tax system. On one occasion, at a meeting with my researcher, a representative from Ed Miliband’s office argued that my agenda was ‘anti-business’, ‘too complicated’ and ‘not an agenda that was going anywhere any time soon’. From the two Eds themselves, I couldn’t get any response. I suspect that this was because they’d both worked in the Treasury under Gordon Brown. No doubt they were worried that anything they said would shine a spotlight on their own complicit failure to stamp out aggressive tax avoidance when they had the power to do so.

It's been a year since Google updated Chromecast by releasing Chromecast 2 with a new design, improved internals, and a refreshed app. At the Mountain View, CA-based company's October 4 event, it announced a new, third-generation model that supports 4K with HDR and Dolby Vision. Here's everything you need to know about Google's new streaming dongle. Google Chromecast: What is it? Google launched the first Chromecast in 2013. It's an affordable HDMI dongle that lets you wirelessly "cast" content to a television. It basically makes most TVs smart. Then, in 2015, Google launched Chromecast 2. It's faster, more responsive, and just as affordable. And it arrived with an updated Chromecast app that serves as a one-stop shop for finding compatible apps and specific content across those apps. For more information on Chromecast, see Pocket-lint's review of Chromecast 2. Chromecast 2 review: Make any TV smart, effortlessly What is Google Cast for Audio? Chromecast now has a guest mode: Here's how to turn on the feature What is Google Chromecast and why should you care? Roku Streaming Stick vs Google Chromecast Amazon Fire TV Stick vs Google Chromecast vs Roku Streaming Stick Google Chromecast Ultra: What is it? Chromecast Ultra looks just like the Chromecast 2, although it's lost the Chrome logo in favour of a small 'G' to fit in with Google's 'Made by Google' message. Google says it's 1.8x faster than the Chromecast 2, which is ideal because it needs to be able to support 4K Ultra HD streams as well as High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Dolby Vision.  It works in exactly the same way as the Chromecast and Chromecast Audio, you simply need to tap the Cast icon in the compatible app on your smartphone or tablet to send content to the big screen. Google Chromecast Ultra: What does it feature? Google's Chromecast Ultra supports 4K Ultra HD content for the benefit of consumers who've upgraded to TVs that support 4K content. By releasing the Ultra, Google has beaten both Amazon Fire TV Stick and Roku Stick in getting 4K support into a small dongle. Amazon and Roku have boxes that support 4K, but not a dongle that can be hidden away behind the TV. Apple's fourth-generation Apple TV box doesn't support 4K either. The Chromecast Ultra can not only stream content via wi-fi, but also comes with an Ethernet port for a wired, more stable internet connection. This is ideal for 4K Ultra HD streams, as they'll require a higher bandwidth and stronger connection than full HD streams. Google Chromecast Ultra: What does it look like? We'd already seen some leaked renders posted by VentureBeat of the Chromecast Ultra and they were pretty spot on. The new model looks almost identical to the Chromecast 2, with the only major difference being the Chrome logo on the HDMI dongle being replaced by a subtle "G" to fall under Google's "Made by Google" tagline. It's a wise move from Google to use the same design as the Chromecast 2, as the new look makes it easy to squeeze between ports behind your TV. It's a small, plastic, hockey-puck-shaped device with a glossy and colourful front and matte bottom. Google Chromecast Ultra: When will it be available? The Google Chromecast Ultra will be available from November.  Google Chromecast Ultra: How much will it cost? Google has confirmed the Chromecast Ultra will cost £69 in the UK when it goes on sale in November and $69 in the US. You can sign up to a waiting list on Google's Store to be notified when it's available to buy. Want to know more? Browse Pocket-lint's Chromecast hub for the latest and breaking news.

Other than the the picturesque scenery, the vehicles have witnessed a handful of strange scenarios - like a broom wielding woman in an electric wheel chair chasing a duck. In a recent monthly report, Google highlighted a few of these bizarre incidents, which the firm says are key to the cars ability to deal with unpredictable road behavior. Scroll down for video  The handful of strange scenarios seen through the eyes of Google's car reveals these machines need to be fully prepared for situations so strange that most of its creators can't dream them up, such as the woman chasing a duck (featured) WHAT HAS THE CAR SEEN?  In Mountain View, California Google's self-driving car witnessed a broom weilding woman chasing a duck in the ride while riding an electric wheel chair. Another strange incident occurred at an intersection, when three non-related cars each made a turn down a one-way, which was the opposite way they were traveling. However, Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, says Austin 'takes the cake'. A group of children were seen playing Frogger around the autonomous vehicle.  A separate occasion, a man came out of nowhere and rolled over the hood of the car - similar to the move in Starksy & Hutch. And finally, a gentleman was so excited to see the Google car on his street that he ran out completely naked.  'On our private test track, we've dreamt up and recreated hundreds of odd scenarios to gauge our car's response, but situations like these demonstrate why public testing of our self-driving cars is important to developing our cars for the road,' Google stated in the firm's March report detailing its autonomous vehicle progress. 'We can try to come up with lots of wacky situations for our cars to handle, but the real world can defy even our wildest imaginations.' This report highlights just how bizarre the human species can be when they think no one is watching. The handful of strange scenarios seen through the eyes of Google's car reveals these machines need to be fully prepared for situations so strange that most of its creators can't dream them up, reports Business Insider. 'Now we have a team of people whose job is to come up with weird stuff and they didn't come up with this,' Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, said at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas in March. 'I looked at the DMV handbook and there is no page in there about 'duck in road'. Other than the the picturesque scenery, the vehicles have witnessed a few strange scenarios - like a broom wielding woman chasing a duck in an electric wheel (pictured). Google highlighted a few of these bizarre incidents, which the firm says are key to the cars learning how to react to unpredictable road behavior RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Landmark ruling as Michigan votes to become first state to...

Share this article Share 48 shares 'This really highlights part of the challenge that our vehicles have to generalize what they have seen and deal with unusual situations.' Ursmson continues to explain that when the machines come across something like the duck scenario, it knows what is happening in front of it is not normal. The car slows itself down, lets the event play out and then goes about its way. Another strange incident in Mountain View happened when someone wanted to play a game with the car. 'When I saw this, I thought this is definitely going to be the weirdest thing we see on the road, well I was wrong,' Urmson said in regards to the woman and duck incident. Despite never encountering humans posing as a group of frogs (featured), Google's car still knew how to react, explains the firm. Google gives its car fundamental capabilities that lets them 'see' other people or unfamiliar objects on the road, rather than just teaching the machines how to handle certain situations 'Since then we've seen people play Frogger with our car – please don't.'

'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Broad themes include: User-centered design Validated learning (build-measure-learn) Exceptional quality Disciplined execution Radical collaboration ...which help us execute against Mozilla's 2016 planning Top Line Guidance areas: Build for Quality Invite Participation Be Clear Compelling and Focused Grow our Influence Prototype the Future Ideas for speakers are solicited from Mozillians on an ongoing basis using this speaker submission form. Preference is given to practitioners i.e. those with hands-on experience in their particular subject area. The speaker(s) will present live from a mozilla office and be streamed to the rest of the offices via Air Mozilla and publicly archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance is 20-30 with remote attendees ranging from 100-200; follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Goal Our goal is to engineer individual connection points and create compelling opportunities beyond day-to-day work for office-based staff to come together in our spaces (in most cases) to share an experience and interact with the those they may not normally work with. Face-to-face chats among people with different skills might spark new ideas, lead to new solutions or at the least, increase workplace camaraderie. Our ultimate goal is to improve performance, innovation and overall engagement. Testimonials "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014. Mozillian Host: Aurelia Moser Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS COMING IN 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 29 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t mozilla: for one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On September 29, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: Currently a senior advisor to Google, from 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others).

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Hashtag: #mozSS July 20, 2016: The Invention Cycle with Tina Seelig, Stanford University Location: Mozilla MV + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, July 20 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Invention Cycle: Going From Inspiration to Implementation Are you stuck on where to go with your product and need an infusion of creativity? Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Hashtag: #mozSS #theinevitable April 27, 2016: When Change is the Only Constant, with Kirsten Wolberg, PayPal Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, April 27 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: When Change is the Only Constant, Org Structure Doesn’t Matter While it may be true in tech that “change is the only constant,” some changes are bigger than others. Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Hashtag: #brantina, #mozSS February 25, 2016: Building Product with Partners - Interview with April Underwood, Slack Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, February 25 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Building Products with Partners: Interview with Slack's April Underwood Building products is complex. Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News. Host: Doug Turner Deck Questions: Submit questions for Deanna during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. August 13, 2015: Build, Measure, Learn: Being a Growth Organization with Hiten Shah, KISSMetrics Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, August 13 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Hiten Shah will share his ideas and experience with growth hacking, a scrappy marketing technique developed by technology startups, and how it specifically applies to Mozilla. Larger companies that embrace this approach (examples include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox) use creativity, analytical thinking, and social metrics to gain product exposure and grow their market share quickly. Speaker: Hiten Shah is cofounder and president of analytics companies KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg; he also advises startups. Host: Jascha Kaykas-Wolff Deck Questions: Submit your questions for Hiten in advance here, or during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. July 23, 2015: Rapid Prototyping with Tom Chi, GoogleX Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, July 23 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Tom Chi has worked in disciplines ranging from astrophysical research to Fortune 500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here. May 21, 2015: Onboarding and Team Debt with Kate Heddleston Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 21 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Kate Heddleston, a software engineer in San Francisco, does a lot of speaking on the people-dimensions of software development and engineering management best practices. Her focus is on how software gets made, as well as on what it does. Topic: Kate shares her thoughts on the topic of onboarding new hires - what it takes to do that well, particularly in an engineering environment - and the 'team debt' that results when we do it poorly. Kate also shared some of the fairly immediate things individual teams can do to reduce the debt. Deck. Questions submitted to Kate in advance are here.

Also on this week’s show, David gives us the backstory on Allo, Google’s chat app with an AI assistant, and how it stacks up against not only Google’s other chat and AI products, but also Apple’s iMessage and Siri.

But they do signal to a likely future scenario when wearable technology is both far more common and far more powerful—and one when the phone plays a diminished role in our tech culture. Yes, we’ll all still have phones, but we may not need to rely on them as much. Also this week: Behind the scenes of David’s iPhone 7 review, and curious pet behavior.

For the second year in a row, the mega search engine released a fashion trend report, revealing what we search for the most—and what we’re all becoming tired of. At the top of the list of trending items in the U.S. and U.K. are bombers, joined by ripped jeans and biker jackets as close runners-up. Apparently, Gigi Hadid was oft searched for alongside bomber jackets, and Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kanye West were also frequently associated with the term. The most popular color: black, of course, followed by pink, green, and olive. Sounds about right. MORE: How a $135 Bomber Became the Year’s Most Ubiquitous Jacket Another big winner was the off-the-shoulder top, which has been enjoying some serious staying power. Celebs who appeared in “off-the-shoulder top” searches the most included Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Olivia Palermo, Alexa Chung and Michelle Obama. White was the crowd fave here, trailed closely by black, red, and blue. Though cold-shoulder tops aren’t necessarily gaining in popularity, they’re also not going anywhere: Google searches for such looks have remained steady all year, hinting that you should keep rocking that Bardot top hard, though you don’t necessarily need to feel obligated to rush out and buy five more (especially since fall is en route). Maybe just one. As such, we collated 35 of our favorite bombers and off-the-shoulder tops on the planet right now, including some warmer options (quilted bombers, long-sleeve tops) to keep you covered at least through the autumn. Happy trending, y’all.

In its self-assumed quest to make the internet a safer place for everyone, Google will soon start publicly shaming websites that fail to use the HTTPS protocol for transmitting passwords and other sensitive data. But instead of a scarlet letter, Google will shame them by marking their websites as "non-secure" so users know clearly that their personal data is not being protected adequately. Website owners have until Jan. 1, 2017, to implement HTTPS for transmitting sensitive data. It is after that date that Google's new site labeling policy will go into effect. The move is part of an ongoing effort by the company to get website owners to start using HTTPS, long considered a much safer alternative to HTTP. Eventually, Google will start marking all HTTP sites as non-secure and not just when they fail to use HTTPS to handle sensitive data. "Our plan to label HTTP sites more clearly and accurately as non-secure will take place in gradual steps, based on increasingly stringent criteria," Chrome security team member Emily Schechter wrote on Google's Online Security Blog this week. "Starting January 2017, Chrome 56 will label HTTP pages with password or credit card form fields as 'not secure,' given their particularly sensitive nature." The move to explicitly label sites as being non-secure marks a planned escalation of Google's current practice of using a neutral indicator on Chrome to indicate HTTP connections. Chrome has for sometime now used a green lock icon on sites that use HTTPS to let users know they are on a secure site. According to Schechter, Chrome's neutral indicator does not do enough to convey the seriousness of the security issues caused by plain HTTP connections. But most users do not perceive the lack of a "secure" icon on HTTP sites as a warning and instead tend to ignore it, which is why Google will start marking such sites more explicitly. Subsequent releases of Chrome will extend HTTP warnings by, among other things, labeling HTTP pages as "not secure" even when a user is in incognito mode and has a higher privacy expectation, Schechter said. Eventually, sites that continue to use HTTP will be labeled with a red triangle that Chrome currently uses for HTTPS sites that are not functioning like they should. HTTPS ensures that communications between a user's browser and a website are encrypted using either the Transport Layer Security protocol or the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. HTTPS connections are considered much harder to intercept and to modify compared with HTTP connections. In order to implement HTTPS, site owners need to obtain a trusted digital certificate for their sites. But Google has noted that several providers currently offer free, bundled or cheap certificates. Projects like Let's Encrypt also have made it very easy for site owners to obtain free digital certificates for multiple subdomains, the company has noted. According to Schechter, a substantial proportion of websites already use HTTPS, and use of the protocol has been rising consistently. More than half of Chrome's page loads on desktops are now served via HTTPS, she said.           LATEST SECURITY ARTICLES   IBM Opens New Global Headquarters for Security Services IoT Devices Evolving Rapidly as Favorite DDoS Attack Tool, Experts Say Dell Data Protection Defends Against External, Insider Threats Kaspersky Alleges Microsoft's Windows Defender Is Anti-Competitive Linux Foundation Back Reproducible Builds Effort for Secure Software                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

It’s light, portable, powerful, beautiful, and reasonably affordable. We recommend it not only over every other Windows notebook, but also Apple’s MacBook line and Google’s Chromebooks. Still, if you insist, we have picked out the best MacBook for OS X die-hards, the best Chromebook for those who desire an affordable laptop with a super-light OS, and the best laptop if you’ve $600 or less to spend. We’ve also selected the best 15-inch laptop — though it, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the Dell XPS 15. Best for most people Dell-XPS-13-Gold-lid2More Why should you buy this: It’s portable, fast, attractive, and reasonably priced. Our Score Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) Portable, powerful, and beautiful, nothing offers the same value as Dell's flagship XPS 13. $1,030.00 from Amazon $1,349.99 from Best Buy Who’s it for: Everyone except gamers. How much will it cost: $800 to $1,600 Why we picked the Dell XPS 13 Dell’s XPS 13 blends a metallic exterior with carbon-fiber interior. It’s a look that’s premium, yet inviting. The XPS 13 is the kind of cool new toy that you’ll be itching to show everyone willing to look. The super-thin InfinityEdge bezel is another highlight. Most laptops have a half-inch to an inch of plastic surrounding the display on all sides. The XPS 13 has less than a quarter of an inch. That’s as functional as it is beautiful, as it makes the system smaller and lighter. Does that make the XPS 13 too small? Nope. The touchpad is as large as the competition and the keyboard is a breeze to use. The system even squeezes in a large battery, which means most models can last a full day before needing a charge (the top-shelf Core i7 model is borderline, though it can manage eight hours if you’re easy on it). There is just one oddity you should know about — the web cam. The bezels are so thin there’s no room for it, so it’s below the display, rather than above. That makes for an awkward angle. Most people won’t care, but it will bug you if you video conference while traveling. Core i3, i5, and i7 processors are available along with a selection of solid state hard drives and up to 16GB of RAM. It doesn’t set any performance records, but it’s on par with other laptops in the category. If you want speed, though, it’s available. The Core i7 models doesn’t have the Core i7-6500U found in most expensive ultrabooks, but instead opts for the Core i7-6560U, which boasts quicker integrated graphics and a higher maximum clock speed. But the XPS 13 doesn’t earn the “best laptop” title because of its premium configuration. The laptop starts at just $800, and can be handsomely equipped for $1,000. These entry-level versions don’t have the fastest available hardware, but they retain the same design, features, and battery life as the most expensive. Nothing else offers the same overall value, and many competitors feel hopelessly out of date when placed next to Dell’s flagship. Before buying, be sure to read our XPS 13 review, as well as our XPS 13 buying guide. The best Mac Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-Ret-2015-inuseMore Read More Why should you buy this: You refuse to use Windows. Our Score Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina (2015) Apple’s notebook will appeal to speed demons, videophiles, and anyone who despises the finicky touchpads on Windows. $1,299.99 from Apple Who’s it for: Anyone who refuses to use Windows. How much will it cost: $1,300 to $1,800 Why we picked the MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina Most people are looking at a Mac for one of two reasons. Either you’re a fan of OS X and refuse to use Windows, or you’re attracted to Apple brand and want to buy one based on the company’s reputation. If you’re in the first group, then nothing we say will sway you. In that case, we recommend you purchase the MacBook Pro — the 13-inch model if you prefer portability, and the 15-inch model if you need power. The Air is ancient, at this point, and frankly should’ve been discontinued last year. The 12-inch MacBook is beautiful, but has some quirks, like a horrid keyboard and a single USB Type-C port for connectivity. If you’re looking at a Mac based on its reputation, we suggest you reconsider. The company has allowed its computers to fall by the wayside. All Mac models equip Intel processors that are one or two generations behind the latest, and the vaunted Retina displays are now equal, at best, to the competition. Mac OS X is a fine operating system that does its job, but we think Windows 10 is even better. Finally, Apple’s laptops are much too expensive for the hardware they offer. Apple does have one big benefit — service. The company tends to cover defective hardware that others might refuse to service, and you can take your Mac to a retail store if you need help. This might sway users who are particularly concerned with potential problems. But a Mac is not bombproof, and most modern laptops can easily last five years. We don’t think fear of an ambiguous future problem that may or may not happen should be what guides your buying decision. The best Chromebook acer-chromebook-15-over-the-shoulder-keyboard-1500x1000More Why should you buy this: You want nice, barebones laptop for less. Our Score Acer Chromebook 15 Looking for a cheap laptop to use as a second PC? You can't go wrong with the Acer. $249.00 from Amazon Who’s it for: Students, people who need only basic functionality, anyone who wants a cheap laptop to use as a second PC. How much will it cost: $200 to $300 Why we picked the Acer Chromebook 15 Chromebooks — laptops that run Google’s Chrome OS — have become a popular budget laptop over the last few years, and we quite like them at Digital Trends. The Acer Chromebook 15 is a great example of their strengths. It has a 1080p display, fast Intel processor, and plenty of memory, all starting at $300 when the product first came out. No Windows notebook priced at $300 comes close. And today you can get it for less even than that. If you’re looking for a budget laptop, Chromebooks are a good choice. But these systems rarely sell for north of $500, with the obvious exception of Google’s Chromebook Pixel, which is too niche for us to recommend. The price brings limitations, of course. You won’t find a Chromebook with a quad-core processor, a fast solid state drive, or an optional discrete GPU. Even if Chromebooks were equipped to compete with the best laptops, the operating system would hold them back. Chrome OS, which is designed around Google’s Chrome Web browser, is wonderfully simple and intuitive, but it can’t run “normal” software. It only runs extensions and Web apps. So while you can access Word Online, for example, you could never install Word. This, of course, means you’re reliant on Wi-Fi access, which isn’t a problem in most situations but becomes a very big problem if the Internet cuts out. Google has upgraded Chrome OS over time to combat this. Now, you can download your Gmail inbox and Google Drive content for offline access. But it’s not enough to make a Chromebook completely reliable. The best budget laptop asus-ux305-desk-1500x1000-3-1500x1000More Why should you buy this: You want an affordable PC that’s also a joy to use. Our Score Asus ZenBook UX305 The Zenbook starts at $600 and has fantastic specs — and far better than what you'll find in other competitors. We're not sure how Asus make... $678.99 from Amazon.com $699.00 from Best Buy Co, Inc. Who’s it for: Everyone except gamers, other power users. How much will it cost: $600 to $800 Why we picked the Asus Zenbook UX305CA The Dell XPS 13 starts at $800. We don’t think that’s a lot for a laptop, but the world obviously disagrees; the average selling price of new laptops has hovered around $600 for years. One option is to watch out for a sale. You shouldn’t have to wait long. Refurbished models have sold for as little as $470, and new systems sometimes dip near the $600 mark. Keep an eye out for coupons on Dell’s site and for sales at major retailers including not just the usual suspects but also the Microsoft Store, which carries a selection of the best Windows laptops. If that doesn’t work, then we suggest the Asus Zenbook UX305CA, another ultrabook we’ve awarded an Editor’s Choice. The Zenbook isn’t as powerful as the Dell XPS 13, and doesn’t emulate the Dell’s strikingly thin bezels. But it’s otherwise an incredible machine. And its value can’t be beat. The base model, which is routinely priced at $600 on the Microsoft Store, has a Core m3 processor, eight gigabytes of RAM, and a 256GB solid state drive. That’s twice the memory and storage of the $800 Dell XPS 13 — and far better than what you’ll find in other competitors. We’re not sure how Asus makes money off it. If you don’t mind spending $50 more, you might consider the Asus Zenbook UX305UA. Only one letter separates its name from the UX305CA, and they’re as similar as that suggests. The UX305UA is slightly larger, slightly heavier, and has a quicker Core i5 processor. These changes make it a better choice for power users. The best large display Dell-XPS-15-2015-featMore Why should you buy this: You want a sleek PC, but also need excellent performance. Our Score Dell XPS 15 Beyond great specs, the Dell XPS 15 can be provisioned with Nvidia mobile graphics and a stellar 4K display. $1,699.99 from Dell Who’s it for: Power users, and those who want a big, beautiful display How much will this cost: $1,000 to $1,650 Why we picked the Dell XPS 15 Okay, the XPS 13 is great. But maybe you want a larger display. You’re not alone. Sales figures have continually shown 15-inch systems beating their smaller rivals. We think this is partially because good, small laptops aren’t cheap — but some people just want a bigger display. There’s nothing wrong with that. Fortunately, Dell also has the XPS 15. It’s great for all the same reasons the XPS 13 is great and, because it’s larger, can be optioned with the fastest hardware available today including a quad-core processor, Nvidia mobile graphics, and a 4K display. We don’t like it quite as much its little brother because it’s quite expensive, and the battery doesn’t hold up as well relative to the competition. But it’s definitely the best 15-incher available right now. The XPS 15 starts at $1,000, though, which is a steep sum. Is there anything more affordable? There is, but nothing stands out as the clear winner. Acer’s Aspire E15 is affordable and powerful, but not attractive. Asus’ X555UB-NH51 looks and feels more luxurious, but is priced higher without a performance bump. Dell’s Inspiron 7000 is a powerful do-it-all entry that can even serve as a budget gaming laptop, but its display is disappointing. Acer’s Chromebook 15 can’t be beat in value, but you have to alright living with Chrome OS. Yes, that’s a lot of options. Picking a budget 15-inch is a tough choice, but if you’re tired of looking and just want a name, go with the Acer Aspire E15 (make sure you buy one with a 1080p display). It’s ugly, but it’ll do the job well enough at an extremely low price. Should you buy now, or wait? Intel has recently announced its new 7th-generation processors. If possible, it’s a good idea to wait until you see an update to the 7th-gen hardware before buying the particular model you have your eye on. But it’s not critical. The new generation isn’t that much quicker than the previous version, and the battery life gain in 7th-gen is minimal. If you can buy a 6th-generation model at a slight discount, or you have reason to believe the 7th-gen update won’t come soon, go ahead and make a purchase. AMD also has new hardware available. While we don’t generally recommend AMD over Intel in laptops, the company’s APUs can make sense in some affordable systems. Keep and eye out for the new chips, which are detailed in this post. Also, this is the holiday buying season. That means a plethora of discounts. A keen eye and quick trigger finger could snag you hundreds of dollars in savings. How we test You’ve read our laptop reviews. You’ve read our conclusions. And now you’re wondering how we came to them. Good question. Reviews often lack context, which is evident in the wildly different scores some laptops receive from different publications. Conflicting opinions can actually make buying a laptop more difficult if the review’s criteria isn’t made clear. Allow us to lift the veil. Here we’ll explain the benchmarks we use for objective testing and the perspective from which we approach subjective topics. We don’t expect everyone to agree with our opinions, but we hope that sharing our process will leave you better equipped to decide what laptop best fits your needs.

While Chrome cannot forbid users from accessing HTTP sites, the web browser can advise them against doing so by marking them to be non-secure. "Chrome currently indicates HTTP connections with a neutral indicator," wrote Emily Schechter, the Chrome Security product manager, in a blog post. "This doesn't reflect the true lack of security for HTTP connections. When you load a website over HTTP, someone else on the network can look at or modify the site before it gets to you." Come January, users of the currently unreleased Chrome 56 will notice a grey “Not secure” warning on HTTP pages that transmit credit card information and passwords. Come January, users of the currently unreleased Chrome 56 will notice a grey “Not secure” warning on HTTP pages that transmit credit card information and passwords. Photo: Google The next step will be implementing the labelling of non secure pages in Incognito mode and later, marking all unencrypted sites with the red triangle icon it uses to reflect a broken HTTPS. Eventually, all unencrypted sites with the red triangle icon it uses to reflect a broken HTTPS. Photo: Google Related Stories Chrome Browser Now Has Google Cast Support Google Experiment Hopes To Prevent Quantum Hacking What’s the difference between HTTPS and HTTP? It all boils down to encryption—or lack thereof. HTTPS—short for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure—ensures that any data exchanged between a user’s browser and website is encrypted. This is imperative for preventing hackers from getting access to sensitive information. HTTP sites, on the other hand, do not offer encryption. As for Google's decision to roll out small changes, Schechter explains that the company will be strategically taking “gradual steps” since studies have found that users “do not perceive the lack of a “secure” icon as a warning” and suffer from “warning fatigue,” which is when they become immune to warnings after being exposed to them too frequently.   Last December, Google gave websites incentive to transition to HTTPS by prioritizing HTTPS pages over HTTP sites. Now, Schechter reveals that over half of the page loads on Chrome are over HTTPS. “We definitely do plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure eventually,” Schechter told Motherboard. “We really wanted to be careful about it and we wanted to get it right.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Using its “WaveNet” model, Google’s AI company in the UK, DeepMind, claims to have created a natural machine-to-human speech that halves “the gap with human performance." Machine babble often sounds emotionally flat and robotic because it’s difficult to capture the natural nuances of human speech. Many systems are still based on a method called “concatenative text-to-speech” (TTS), which sounds out words by stringing together a large collection of phonetic sounds. Researchers have managed to improve speech synthesis a bit by using “parametric text-to-speech,” which uses a vocoder – a device that employs a set of algorithms to process sounds from speech. Although parametric TTS is more complex than concatenative TTS, the result can be even worse for syllabic languages like English, according to Google. Like many existing AI projects, DeepMind has turned to using neural networks – a system modelled on how the human brain works – capable of processing huge heaps of data to perform a specific task. WaveNet directly models the “raw waveform of the audio signal, one sample at a time.” It requires high computing power, because raw audio produces about 16,000 samples per second at many time scales. The neural network is trained by recording human speech. As the sounds are sampled, a value is “drawn from a probability distribution computed by the network.” The value is then pumped back into the input and the system has to predict the next step for each sample. Building up these samples from a wider range of human voices makes the result more realistic. Google DeepMind claims that using WaveNet in US English and Mandarin Chinese has closed the gap between human and AI speech by 50 per cent, according to mean opinion scores calculated by subjective evaluation. After training, to transform text to speech, WaveNet has to first process the text. The words in the text are unscrambled into a “sequence of linguistic and phonetic features” that feeds into the neural network. Training WaveNets without text results in gibberish. The AI system has to make it up as it goes along, stringing together human-sounding noises that don’t make any sense. In DeepMind’s blog post, it hasn’t said how this technology will be applied. But the team has used it to produce AI-made piano music. You can hear how the AI speaks and makes music here. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 32 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Two critical bugs and more malicious apps make for a bad week for Android Google releases fixes for newer devices and ejects apps following reports. by Dan Goodin - Sep 9, 2016 8:22 pm UTC Login to bookmark 178 Ron Amadeo It was a bad week for millions of Android phone users. Two critical vulnerabilities were disclosed but remain unpatched in a large percentage of devices, while, separately, malicious apps were downloaded as many as 2.5 million times from Google's official Play Marketplace. The vulnerabilities, which are similar in severity to the Stagefright family of bugs disclosed last year, have been fixed in updates Google began distributing Tuesday. A large percentage of Android phones, however, aren't eligible to receive the fixes. Even those that do qualify don't receive them immediately (the September updates are currently not available as over-the-air downloads for either of the Nexus 5X devices in my household). That gives attackers crude blueprints for exploiting vulnerabilities that remain unpatched on millions of devices. "Extremely serious bug" The first vulnerability was disclosed by Mark Brand, a researcher with Google's Project Zero security team. Indexed as CVE 2016-3861, it allows attackers to execute malware or escalate local privileges on vulnerable phones. Brand warned that it's "an extremely serious bug" because it can be exploited in a large variety of ways. He also said CVE 2016-3861 wasn't particularly hard to detect, a finding that increases the chances that other researchers already knew about it. (In any event, Brand included proof-of-concept exploit code with his disclosure. A Google spokesman said the exploit was for research purposes, worked only on an undisclosed subset of Nexus devices, and "could not be used in real world attacks without substantial modification and even further research.") Brand didn't say exactly which Android version introduced the code-execution vulnerability, but he indicated that it's present in at least several of the most recent releases. "The provided exploit performs this on several recent Android versions for the Nexus 5x and is both reliable and fast in my testing," he wrote in a blog post published Wednesday. "It would also be possible to make the exploit faster by directly generating the exploit files in javascript, reducing the unnecessary network round-trips [spent] retrieving identical mp4 files." The same Android update patches a separate critical vulnerability that's similar to Stagefright. Cataloged as CVE-2016-3862, it can be exploited by sending a maliciously formatted jpeg image. When sent through Gmail or Google Talk, the malicious code is concealed inside Exif data embedded in the image. The target doesn't need to click on anything to become compromised. "To an advanced attacker, this was relatively easy to find and in their wheelhouse to exploit," Tim Strazzere, director of mobile research at SentinelOne and the researcher who reported the bug to Google, told Threatpost. "You would have access to anything that app had access to or leverage another exploit to get system privileges or root." The vulnerabilities were made public the same week that security firm Checkpoint disclosed that recently discovered apps, some available since April, had been downloaded from Google Play as many as 2.5 million times. One malware family dubbed DressCode was likely used to generate fraudulent clicks on ads, but Checkpoint researchers said it could also be used to breach internal networks and retrieve sensitive files from them. DressCode was found in more than 40 Google Play apps that had been downloaded from 500,000 to 2 million times. In a separate post published Thursday, Checkpoint disclosed an app that contained code that redirected infected phones to websites that generated fraudulent revenue. Known as CallJam, the malware also included code that called fee-based premium phone numbers, although this ability was only invoked after receiving permission from end users. CallJam was embedded into an app called "Gems Chest for Clash Royale," which was downloaded from 100,000 to 500,000 times. The app, as well as those containing DressCode, were removed from Play following the posts. Post updated on September 10 to add details in the third paragraph about the proof-of-concept exploit. Expand full story Promoted Comments bvz_1 Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post I know that by now this is getting to be a tired refrain, but until phone reviews put updates at or near the top of their scoring we are never going to get this problem fixed. For example every single review of every single Motorola device should start with: "We cannot recommend any Motorola phones because of Lenovo's corporate policy of not providing timely updates for serious security issues once phone have been purchased by customers. If data security is not an issue that concerns you, by all means continue reading this review." Of course, Google has to take some serious steps to make more of the underlying code updatable via the play store as well. Finally, and this is well beyond the scope of anything that will ever happen, Android has to be redesigned such that it is an installable OS much like Windows or Linux. I have heard that Linux (and therefore Android) has a Kernel that makes this much more difficult to do for all the various hardware combinations out there... but it has to be doable. Maybe the core of Android just becomes a compiler specific to that hardware, and Android itself is released as source code that gets recompiled on install? I am not technical enough to know if this is even possible. But something has to be done. In the mean time, Nexus. Or if you are rich enough and it floats your boat, iPhone. Nothing else seems like it would be a viable alternative. And woe be to you if you cannot afford one of these two. In that case you are simply going to be vulnerable. 629 posts | registered 3/5/2009 cdillon Smack-Fu Master, in training et Subscriptor jump to post logic_88 wrote: cdillon wrote: I still haven't received the September 6 OTA update on my Nexus 6P. What's up with that, Google? Updates are not pushed to all users at the same time. They are usually pushed to a small number of users first and then the spigot is gradually opened up as time passes. If you want to jump the queue, grab the OTA from Google's site. https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/a ... 3f6b27.zip Thanks for the link. I completely understand the reasoning for slowly spreading the larger updates, like the roll-out of Nougat. The company I work for does exactly the same thing with their software, and the major version updates are spread out about a week. We do not, however, spread out the security updates. They're available to everybody at the same time and will be installed according to their usual (daily) auto-update schedule, or can be installed instantly just by triggering a manual update. A little bit of spread is OK, but the update window for the security fixes is a little bit too large if it hasn't made it out to everybody within a couple of days. 61 posts | registered 7/18/2010 Reader comments 178 You must login or create an account to comment.

Your audience is the most important aspect of your digital marketing campaign. A trend you’ll see continue to rise in 2016 and beyond is designing a user experience. As you’re designing a website or mobile app for your brand, ask yourself if your users will have a memorable experience and whether your message will leave an impact. User experience testing and practicing is no longer optional. As quickly as a user finds your website, they will just as quickly bounce and move on if they don’t have the experience they hoped. It starts with usability, cleanliness, and the value it brings to your audience. But it’s so much more than that. All aspects of your website contribute to the overall experience. Every business and every website you interact with has their own way of expressing themselves. How are you going to make sure your voice is heard and your customers find what they need on your website? User Experience Defined If you ask Google what user experience is, they answer your question with “the overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.” In terms of evaluating your user experience, analyze how your visitors are interacting with the site. How do they navigate across the site? Look at how they consume content and how the design is working. What’s appealing your customers? UX design works when you allow your customers to complete actions or find information as quickly as possible. When complying with the definition provided by Google’s answer box, you have the capability of expanding your business by appealing to new, pleased customers. Guide the user through the funnel, helping them to achieve their goals while exceeding your goals. Aspects Incorporated Into the Experience When you land on a website, what’s the first thing you’re looking for? Accessibility, usability, value or credibility, or a heading tag showing what the page is about. All of your customers are looking for something unique. The experience starts with a usable design, appealing to the emotions and behaviors of your audience: Appearance Tone of Voice Visual Design & Layout Consistency Clear Call to Action Page Load Speed In order to truly draw your users in, explore the use of clean concepts paired with appealing images and powerful content. Avoid any distractions that negatively affect engagement and are not necessary to your end-user. Make sure your users can easily find relevant information to quickly make decisions. The ability to interact with your brand and your website captures attention and leaves your users with a positive experience. All elements of the interface make up the design. Establish trust for your brand by simplifying your interface, offering easy navigation, and quick answers to any concerns your visitors have. Always continue to look for ways to improve the end-user experience. Test data sets and gather feedback from your customers, family, and friends. A/B Testing You may think that your design is appealing and attractive, yet your traffic and conversions haven’t increased. You never know how your visitors will be interacting with your brand. Test different variations of page designs to see which performs best with your audience. Look at various factors and leverage how you can increase visibility of particular elements to gain more interaction. Which elements need to pop? Your call to action, contact information, icons, and heading tags. Make sure they stand out. What Should You Test? Look at aspects of your site that have a high impact on your visitors. Alter the color schemes and the wording of your call to action buttons. Use clear icons, attractive colors, and different fonts for your text. Focus on the user. Your users are looking for two things from your website: Simplicity Helpfulness Test your landing pages and see which designs draw the most attention and interaction from your visitors. There are many tools and software you can use for your A/B Testing. Try Optimizely to see which areas of your website have the highest engagement levels. The purpose of A/B Testing is to find issues and problems, and eliminate them from your design. How are you going to increase performance of your website? A/B Testing gives you the information you need to identify any problems so you can increase click-through rates and generate business. How Do You Generate Business From User Experience? A first impression makes all the difference. Perception is everything. Enhance your marketing by focusing on UX design. Be consistent across channels. Make sure the experience between desktop, tablet, and smartphone remains the same. As close to 75% of your consumers are accessing your website on a mobile device, your mobile experience should enable action triggers that increase conversions. Create a buyer persona for your brand to look at your website from a conversion and user standpoint. Applying UX design to your marketing campaign benefits greatly from user personas, laid out by MarketingProfs. Once you have a positive perception through user experience, you’ll add positive associations and enhance your reputation. Decisions to buy your product or request your services depends on customer experience. When you optimize the experience, you’ll stand out ahead of your competitors. Optimizing your site will result in: Reduced Bounce Rate More Page Views More Contact Boxes Filled Out Increased Sales When your website performs efficiently and is clear and concise, action will be persuaded. In turn, business will be generated. The SEO Relationship Your SEO campaign and UX design go hand in hand. Going back to the aspects of page load speed and a clear, simple CTA, these factors matter too in SEO. As outlined by Search Engine Watch, SEO has as much to do with how users engage on a site as it does with rankings. Higher traffic and better user experience leads to more links, shares, and higher rankings. Your SEO will benefit from a pleasurable user experience, but only if the two are aligned. Optimizing your on-page factors with highly relevant and compelling content, together with a user-friendly and appealing design, leads to successful digital marketing. Be sure to avoid both UX and SEO issues with redirects or re-branding your business. Focusing too much on UX can result in a dip in rankings and traffic. On the other hand, too much focus on optimization and not experience will increase your bounce rate and hinder user engagement. With the same business goals in mind, make sure your SEO staff and UX team work together to find the balance that results in increased traffic and conversions. Identifying Problems Are you failing to gain traffic and revenue from your website? Put yourself in the frame of mind of your target users. Understand what they’re looking for and why they’re visiting your website. What are the issues you’re dealing with? Look into the analytics of your website and landing pages, searching for key metrics that help you identify problems. Analytics for customer journeys enables you to find opportunities for improvement and quickly correct any problems. Time on Site How long are visitors on your site? Are you capturing their attention long enough to make your voice heard? Design and experience keeps visitors interested. If they aren’t staying on your site now, enhance and simplify the design and get them to stay. Bounce Rates An optimized UX design encourages visitors to explore your website. Without a captivating design, your visitors will lose interest and bounce. Think about the last time you updated the design. If it’s outdated and doesn’t pop, your visitors won’t view you as a credible source for information or trust your services. This leads to a high bounce rate (when a user lands on your site and immediately leaves). Consistent updates will help lower your bounce rate. Do this effectively by updating your content, improving page load speed, and offering simple navigation. It all begins with an investment in a design that provides trust. UX Surveys You should never stop testing and gathering information about your website. Feedback surveys can deliver valuable information that will help you design a more appealing website for your users. As laid out by KISSmetrics, keep the surveys short and ask only what you need to know. Offer options to garner the most truthful results and feedback. User feedback is key. According to MarketingProfs, “You can’t create a satisfying user experience without actively and consistently gathering user feedback.” Surveys help put you into the minds of your consumers and learn how your site impacts them. Use this information to identify issues and create a positive experience. Exit Pages It’s always good to look at all angles. A few quick exits may not be cause for alarm. Your competition could be visiting your site and leaving without converting. That’s not a problem with your design. Looking further into the exit pages, determine whether important pages of the conversion funnel have a high exit rate. If so, you should be concerned. Analyze each page with a high exit rate. Does it offer value and present your information in an engaging manner? Is there potential to give your users further value on these pages? A good design will solve your problems and the problems experienced by your customers. Through simple navigation and usability, your design will attract the right audience and establish the trust that leads to further business. Brands Doing it Right Get an idea of the types of designs that provide a positive experience. Think about your goals and your target audience, providing an easy solution for increased conversions. Here are brands that have seen success after adjusting their design and interface for the best UX possible. Virgin America Reinventing the flying experience, Work & Co simplified and redesigned the Virgin America website in 2014 to simplify the booking experience. It’s a clear structure that is not cluttered so your eyes focus on the important information. All of your needs are above the fold for easy booking and no distractions. Travelers are busy and Virgin America created a design that responds beautifully to their behaviors. It’s responsive, loads quickly, and meets the needs of travelers quickly with its basic nature. Airbnb When you visit Airbnb, you’re looking for a place to stay. The design is welcoming, easy to use, and offers convenient navigation. Wherever you’re going, Airbnb lets you know right away that they have the destination you’re seeking. For new users, you can browse all available host houses before logging in and creating an account. The team of designers at Airbnb look to impact all aspects of your journey. From the mobile app to the website, each visit is personalized and invites you to keep scrolling. High engagement leads to more interaction, more returning visitors, and more conversions. The focus on UX is a leading factor that helped grow the company to over $10 billion. LA Times As one of the leading sources of news in the entire country, the LA Times shifted to a focus on experience. The bold design puts the focus on multimedia and it’s fully responsive, transforming how its users consume news. Reaching the user with their interface and the advertiser with their design improves the experience for all visitors. They set the standard for today’s news consumption with its mobile-first design that is visually striking and simple to navigate. The company responded to a shift in the industry and appealed to their users by providing a design that connected with the tendencies of their audience. They looked at the problems both readers and advertisers were experiencing, and developed a responsive solution that solved those problems. It has resulted in more engagement and more page views per visit. As UX stays on the road to a multi-channel and multi-device accessibility, you’ll have new opportunities to design an interactive app or website. Give your users a sense of control with an empowering UX and take some advice from these brands to give yourself a competitive advantage. Key Takeaways Creating a memorable user experience results in a significant ROI for your business. UX is a benefit to your brand. The best way to attract repeat customers and grow your business online is by continually testing. Test daily, weekly, or monthly. Your first impression needs to resonate. Appeal to your visitors, and focus on optimizing the experience and the value of your site for increased exposure to the right audience. Find out what’s connecting with your audience and deliver a desirable design. Do just a little more than the rest, and explore new ways to personalize your brand. Through your website and mobile app design, think about the experience you are providing. This will lead to more downloads, more visits, and more interaction with your brand. Use multiple approaches and methods to deliver your message to your audience. Provide easy navigation with a clean design that drives engagement. Engage users with top of fold elements to keep them scrolling through your site. Designing an excellent experience is crucial. The internet is too crowded to blend in. The more consistent of an experience you create, the more you’ll reach your audience. The experience will always be present. How are you going to make that experience positive?   Image Credits Featured Image: Image by Gabrielle Frake. Used with permission. In-post Photos: Images by Gabrielle Frake. Used with permission.

SUBSCRIBE Tips for when and how to use Feed Rules in Google Merchant Center With more functionality now available in Feed Rules, here is a look at how some marketers have been using them to improve Google Shopping campaign performance. Ginny Marvin on September 9, 2016 at 12:07 pm More With Google’s roll out of the new Merchant Center interface came more functionality for Feed Rules. Feed Rules debuted earlier this year to allow marketers to make some changes to their product feed data right within Merchant Center. But what can you really do with Feed Rules and who should be using them? The consensus is that Feed Rules are still best for simple updates, and it’s ideal to make changes to the actual feed. In reality, however, that’s not always possible or timely and why Feed Rules have such appeal. Maggie Webb, Partner at Five Mill Inc., says that while most fixes and feed updates require editing by a feed service or developer, Feed Rules can offer a fix in the interim and be a big help to smaller businesses that don’t have resources at the ready to make updates. “Since a high percentage of ecommerce traffic is from Google Shopping, even a simple change from a Feed Rule can make a big impact on an account,” says Webb. Add missing required data For example, Webb has used Feed Rules to pull a Disapprovals report and manually manipulate best selling and top performing products that are missing required information with an if/then statement in Feed Rules. Here’s what that kind of rule would look like to assign a GTIN to a product using the ID: Webb has also used Feed Rules to create new Custom Labels in order to restructure Shopping campaigns, and to create product filters for Dynamic Remarketing ads. Populate Custom Columns for better campaign structure In an account that had a poor PLA structure because the Product type column wasn’t being used effectively (it just reused what was in the Google Product Category), Webb set up rules to populate the Custom Column 0 field in a way that would allow her to structure the Shopping campaigns more effectively. She created rules to pass the most granular level of the Google Product Category field to Custom Column 0. “This allowed for a hierarchy of bidding based on grouping products based on their category taxonomy, then by product brand within that category taxonomy and then by individual Product ID,” says Webb. For Example : If Google Product Category = Apparel & Accessories > Shoes > Athletic Shoes & Sneakers > Athletic Shoes > Cycling Shoes , Then, Custom Label 0 = Cycling Shoes. That rule would look like the first example in the screenshot below:   The new Custom Column enabled Webb to restructure the campaigns to be able to set bids based on Cycling Shoes, Brands within Cycling Shoes and the Product IDs within those Brands in Cycling Shoes.   Assign a common identifier to be able to group products together The client that needed a subset of products filtered out of their Dynamic Remarketing ads had no common identifier in the feed that could be used to remove them. Webb created a new Custom Label by manually inserting a value based on the product IDs to filter out the unwanted products without having to wait for manual changes to the feed. Speed up promotion updates With the holidays coming up, Kirk Williams, founder of Zato Marketing, points to using Feed Rules for promotion updates. “I love having the Promotion ID feed field editable in the GMC UI now,” says Williams “Before, even for simple edits, I would have to contact the client and rely on the speed of their dev team to add that field into the feed. Now I can go in, set it correctly, create the Promotion ID in the Promotions tab and I’m done!” (Note, if you’re not already signed up for Promotions, you can do so from the Merchant Center Programs page found by clicking on the three-dot icon in the upper right corner of Merchant Center.) Caveats Todd Bowman, Director of SEM and Feeds at Merkle, thinks Feed Rules can be very beneficial with retailers with small and simple feeds, but points to limitations for larger retailers. For example, it can take a few hours to apply new rules to larger feeds, according to Google, and there isn’t a way to combine feeds from separate data sources with Feed Rules. Retailers with hundreds of thousands of SKUs and possibly hundreds of optimization rules are still going to be best served by feed management providers and agencies like Merkle that can push out large, complex feeds in less than 20 minutes, says Bowman. You can find more details on the updated Feed Rules in the Adwords help center.

Barb Palser on September 9, 2016 at 10:25 am More Users swipe through content from multiple publishers in Google’s Top Stories AMP viewer. By now most publishers should be aware of Google’s imminent plan to surface Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMPs) throughout mobile search results. AMP links will no longer be limited to the Top Stories area of mobile results; instead, Google will link to the AMP version of a webpage any time a valid AMP is available. This “blue links” expansion will dramatically increase AMP traffic overall and enable discovery of a rapidly growing universe of non-news and long-tail AMP content.

SUBSCRIBE Digitizing traditional marketing methods to compete in local search Columnist Lydia Jorden discusses techniques to digitize traditional marketing in a way that allows your brand to connect with its traditional audience while maintaining competitive local SERP positioning. Lydia Jorden on September 9, 2016 at 11:19 am More For local brands and companies, it can be hard to initially bridge the gap between traditional and digital marketing. Many local companies, even very successful ones, see more value in traditional marketing methods than inbound digital engagement. Recently, we’ve seen brands increase local search performance by digitizing traditional marketing methods, translating offline to online marketing. Local businesses that are struggling to understand how to make the move from traditional to digital can follow a few strategies. Use hashtags correctly In early 2015, Google and Twitter partnered in a way that allowed Google to collect information and have access to Twitter’s data stream. This means that if your local campaign is running on hashtags across various digital touchpoints (mainly Twitter), you can use this to increase the strength of your local search presence. Work on incorporating hashtags into printed and other materials to encourage your audience to take the conversation online. The hashtag you create should incorporate a keyword with high search volume that speaks to your brand and the goal of your campaign. Red Door Interactive focused on running a campaign that bridged the gap between traditional and digital marketing using hashtags. It ran a campaign for ASICS that created a seamless offline to online digital experience to connect with the local New York and runner community to garner local interest during the 2015 TCS New York Marathon. Red Door Interactive’s push to elevate ASICS in the local search landscape developed with harnessing the importance of race day supporters. Knowing that supporters hold up encouraging signs to runners, a sign generator was created so that supporters could customize and print their own signs. The community was able to customize signs for the race online, share the signs to various social networks with the hashtag #GoRunIt, and finally print the signs which accomplished bridging the gap between offline and online. Lisa Brown, a real estate agent, shows this practice in a more local environment. She created a hashtag for her real estate services and found a way to digitize traditional marketing by including the hashtag on her billboard. Furthermore, she has found a creative way to understand some of the ROI that the billboard offers using digital marketing. Those who submit a photo of the billboard and follow her on a social channel are entered into a contest. When the hashtag is seen in printed material, the audience understands that using that hashtag within posts or conversations online can help further engage with the brand or others searching on the hashtag. Garner inbound links and press around an event As you develop a product or event for your local brand, think about how the PR surrounding it can be translated to digital. According to Moz’s 2015 Local Search Ranking Factors survey, link signals are among the top ranking factors for local SEO, and we can use this information to our advantage. Go to the press, or submit press releases through paid providers (PRweb.com, for example) to increase inbound links to the site. Your website’s domain authority will increase depending upon how credible and trusted the websites are that provide you with an inbound link. Developing an event or product that is worthy of press can help increase inbound links to your site which works to increase positioning in the local pack. Take what you’ve done offline, and make something noteworthy of it that people will want to write about. Then measure the inbound link benefits and see how it translates to elevating local search performance. Pursue inbound links from people already talking about you Find sites that mention your business, and reach out to the webmaster for links to your site. After all, if a website is mentioning your company, you should be getting an inbound link from them to help increase your local SEO. You can find sites that mention you by going to Google.com and typing in the name of your business in quotes. From here, identify listings where a site mentioned your business but did not link back to you. Identify that site’s domain authority to determine how important it is to garner a link from the site. If you find that the site has substantially high domain authority, it is worth investing your time into garnering a link from the webmaster. The example used below is from Blue Bottle Coffee. This is the type of search I would perform if I was wanting to find listings where Blue Bottle Coffee is mentioned within the past month: Create an incentive for your audience to get digitally involved Maintaining a relationship with your audience online is critical for a variety of reasons. Updating your customers on new products, services, or sales can all be done at little to no cost, on a moment’s notice, and excite conversation around your brand. For local businesses with a loyal following, it can be hard to get customers to engage online. Recently, we’ve seen more local businesses prompting their customers to bridge the gap between online and offline. The Backporch Café, a local restaurant to Fort Collins, works to get its customers online in an effort to bring its food to the forefront of people searching for restaurants in the specific area. In the image below, we see that The Backporch Café is working to gain more impressions online through social media by encouraging current customers to post a photo of a meal and use branded hashtag. While this may not directly lead to gains within Google’s local pack, anything that increases a business’s visibility online has the potential to indirectly impact local SEO efforts. By spreading brand awareness, you can increase searches for your business and improve site authority through inbound links. Get started We rarely think about how we can improve local search performance by digitizing traditional efforts. However, connecting your offline and online marketing strategies can significantly help increase local search optimization efforts and connect a more traditional audience to the online world. With competition as fierce as it is within local search, we need to find ways to improve local search performance without sacrificing those who respond to traditional marketing. Start with some of the techniques discussed above, and work from that to a larger offline-to-online campaign to help strengthen local impressions. When a campaign’s purpose is to drive digital local engagement and increase local search positioning across directory sites, continue to think about how your brand can begin to digitize its traditional marketing.

Share Roma Panganiban filed under: Big Questions, books, literature Image credit:  iStock Like us on Facebook When Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1440, he couldn’t have foreseen how his humble creation would eventually lead to a global industry churning out millions of books each year. In the centuries since, new books continue getting published while old books pile up so that the total number of books that exist would be inconceivable to a man who placed every letter by hand. While counting up all the actual individual texts populating bookstores, public libraries, and private collections throughout the world would be a Sisyphean task, there might be a way to at least approximate how many unique book titles have ever been published. Trying to determine how many books there are first raises a deceptively simple question: What is a book, anyway? That can get deeply philosophical very quickly, and there’s no single answer to it. The team behind Google Books (whose ambitious goal is to digitize all printed material, allowing unprecedented access to the world’s knowledge in a single database) came up with their own definition in 2010, in an attempt to answer this thorny query: What they refer to as a “tome” comprises an “idealized bound volume,” covering the range from a bestselling novel with copies available at every airport newsstand to a rare, leather-bound out-of-print edition to a single catalogued manuscript of someone’s PhD dissertation going quietly unread in a university collection. On its surface, this definition replicates the concept underlying International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), the universal identifiers for all books in the commercial marketplace. However, ISBNs have only existed since the mid-1960s and have yet to be widely adopted in non-Western regions of the world, so relying solely on that single number omits vast portions of printed material. Even when they are used, the process of assigning ISBNs isn’t particularly rigorous, so plenty of “book-like objects” that are definitely not books come with an ISBN: audiobooks, instructional DVDs, flash cards, etc. Relying solely on ISBNs to determine the number of published books offers a murky, unsatisfying answer. Other institutions have attempted to standardize their comprehensive book catalogs, among them WorldCat and the Library of Congress, but these numbers are even more likely to be assigned in multiples to the same titles due to different cataloguing rules. Simple titles, author names, and publishing companies are less reliable still, as human error in transcribing all that information into a database can also lead to duplicates. The success of Google Books’s attempt at solving this problem takes into account all these various shortcomings, and uses them to cross-reference nearly a billion raw records from 150 distinct providers to narrow down the number to just one of each book. After weeding out all the assumed duplicates, there are still certain non-book entries that need to be discarded, including two million videos, two million maps, and a turkey probe that was once added to a library card catalog as an April Fools' Day joke. All told, Google Books came up with—drumroll, please!—129,864,880 books total. Phew. But wait, there’s more! Despite Google’s best efforts, their algorithm fails to account for certain crucial factors: Not only is their calculation outdated, having been tallied in 2010, but it predates the recent surge in self-publishing, especially in digital formats. Though ISBNs are recommended for all titles, they are not required for self-published works carried in most e-book marketplaces, and there is no reliable system for keeping track of them otherwise. As the popularity of self-publishing increases, with nearly half a million new titles released in 2013 alone, the Google Books algorithm only gets further from reality. Until Google updates its methodology, we can at least do a little extrapolation with the data we have to figure out a more accurate number of published books in existence in 2016. It’s a moving target, relies on unreliable ISBNs, and will require some educated guessing along the way, but here it goes anyway. According to Bowker, the organization responsible for keeping track of all newly assigned ISBNs in the United States, the years 2011 to 2013 saw the publication of nearly one million new titles (and maybe a few reprints). A U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook statistic indicates that the United States produces about 40 percent of the world’s printed material; if it would be fair to assume that the U.S. is responsible for a similar percentage of non-printed text, it becomes possible to estimate a figure for total global book production, which comes out to about 2,267,265 new books published worldwide from 2011 to 2013. More recent data is hard to come by, so the best way of filling in the gap between 2013 and now may be to average book production over the last three years (755,755 new titles annually worldwide) and add that to the 2013 total. After some basic arithmetic, it seems that a low threshold for the number of unique books in existence as of halfway through 2016 is (another drumroll, please) 134,021,533 total.

Because web traffic transmitted over HTTP is not encrypted, it can be monitored -- or even changed -- by an attacker. Google's announcement is part of a long-term strategy to motivate users and content providers to migrate away from transmitting unencrypted web content. "Beginning in January 2017 (Chrome 56), we'll mark HTTP sites that transmit passwords or credit cards as nonsecure, as part of a long-term plan to mark all HTTP sites as nonsecure," Emily Schechter, a product manager in the Chrome security team, wrote on the Google Security Blog. "Chrome currently indicates HTTP connections with a neutral indicator. This doesn't reflect the true lack of security for HTTP connections. When you load a website over HTTP, someone else on the network can look at or modify the site before it gets to you." The plan to move away from HTTP is ongoing. "In following releases, we will continue to extend HTTP warnings, for example, by labelling HTTP pages as 'not secure' in Incognito mode, where users may have higher expectations of privacy," Schechter wrote. "Eventually, we plan to label all HTTP pages as nonsecure, and change the HTTP security indicator to the red triangle that we use for broken HTTPS." Previous steps in the campaign to improve Chrome browser security included Google's launch of its Certificate Transparency Report. Google -- and other leading browser providers -- has also been removing support for other deprecated or insecure protocols and algorithms, including SHA-1, RC4 and SSLv3. Eventually, all pages that use HTTP will display a warning in Google's Chrome browser. "Google is taking a great step toward improving security on the web by alerting users to websites that are using weak encryption that endangers security and privacy. It remains to be seen if users will pay attention," said Kevin Bocek, vice president of security strategy and threat intelligence at Venafi, based in Salt Lake City. "Unfortunately, many organizations are struggling to keep up with Google's efforts to increase authentication, confidence and privacy. Many organizations still blindly trust all encrypted traffic, even though we know that cybercriminals have been able to subvert encryption in a variety of cyberattacks. As far back as 2012, a broad range of industry voices, including Gartner, started sounding the alarm on this topic, but, so far, most organizations have been less than responsive." In other news: The FBI has arrested two more of the "Crackas with Attitude," who last year managed to create a stir after they hacked CIA Director John Brennan's AOL account. The U.S. Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of Virginia announced in a press release that two North Carolina men had been arrested in connection with their alleged roles in the hacking of several senior U.S. government officials and U.S. government computer systems. According to charging documents filed with the court, the two conspired with other members of the group from about October 2015 to February 2016, using "'social engineering' hacking techniques, including victim impersonation, to gain unlawful access to the personal online accounts of senior U.S. government officials, their families and several U.S. government computer systems. In some instances, members of the conspiracy uploaded private information that they obtained from victims' personal accounts to public websites; made harassing phone calls to victims and their family members; and defaced victims' social media accounts. At least three other members of the conspiracy are located in the United Kingdom and are being investigated by the Crown Prosecution Service." According to research from the German security consulting firm SEC Consult, millions of internet-facing devices are still sharing private keys, and the problem has gotten 40% worse over the past nine months. The research discovered millions of routers, modems, internet gateways and other embedded devices use secret keys and certificates that have been improperly baked in to firmware images to allow access to SSH and HTTPS for remote management of devices. "The number of devices on the web using known private keys for HTTPS server certificates has gone up by 40% in the last nine months (3.2 million in November 2015 vs. 4.5 million now)," SEC Consult wrote. Google finished patching four vulnerabilities, collectively dubbed Quadrooter, in Android devices using Qualcomm chips. Two of the four vulnerabilities (CVE 2016-2503 and CVE 2016-2504) were patched in Google's Android Security Bulletins for July and August; the last two (CVE-2016-2059 and CVE-2016-5340) were patched in the September bulletin. As many as 900 million devices were vulnerable to the flaws, which were presented by Check Point researchers at DEF CON in Las Vegas this summer. According to Check Point, the flaws could be exploited by an attacker using a malicious app. "Such an app would require no special permissions to take advantage of these vulnerabilities, alleviating any suspicion users may have when installing." Dell finally swallowed EMC in the final chapter of the $60 billion deal that included the acquisition of RSA. RSA President Amit Yoran wrote in a blog post that the new ownership would not change RSA's mission, stating: "There will be no changes to our product strategies, sales models, customer support interactions, processes or resources that we are not driving." EMC bought RSA in 2006 for $2.1 billion. At the time, many questioned the wisdom of EMC's purchase of RSA. Next Steps Find out more about using the Let's Encrypt open certificate authority.

The game is just over 60 days old—after first debuting on July 6—and is now the fastest game to have reached $500 million in revenue, despite a continued decline in both downloads and usage. “Now, after debuting in early July, Pokémon GO has surpassed $500 million in worldwide customer spending for Google Play and the iOS App Store,” reads the App Annie report. “This puts the game solidly on track to hit $1 billion in revenue by the end of 2016, as we predicted the month of its launch.” That $500 million may sound like a lot of money (okay, it is a lot of money), but it gets split among developer Niantic, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo, along with app-store owners Apple and Google.  Apple and Google take a 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases. Of what's left, the breakdown is a bit more convoluted, since both Nintendo and Google’s parent company Alphabet have ownership stakes in Niantic and Nintendo owns a third of the Pokémon Company. One early estimate put Nintendo's total take at no more than 10 percent.  This isn’t the first milestone for Pokémon Go, as the app was quick to set records from being the most downloaded app in the first week of an app release to the fastest app to reach 50 million installs on Google Play. The app’s ability to set records should come as no surprise since Niantic Labs found that Pokémon Go has been downloaded 500 million times around the globe. The App Annie report also found high retention rates by looking at Android users. “We looked at the top Android phone apps by monthly active users (MAU) in the US to see which games had the top 30-day retention rates,” reads the report. “While Pokémon GO is behind the highly addictive Words With Friends, it is ahead of mega-hits Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and Candy Crush Saga.” Echoing these findings is engagement data from mobile app intelligence firm SensorTower, which found that Pokémon Go players spent an average of 32 minutes on the game in August, down only slightly from 33 minutes back during the game's July peak. Time spent on the game is higher than that on popular social media platforms (users spend an average of 22 minutes on the Facebook app, 18 minutes on Snapchat and 17 minutes on the Twitter app) but lower than other games like Game of War and Candy Crush Saga—users spend an average of two hours a day on the former and 43 minutes on the latter. In fact, reaching the $500 million mark in such a short time is a significant accomplishment when taking into consideration how much time players spend on games like Candy Crush and how long it took the mobile game to making $500 million in revenue—200 days. Games like Clash of Clans and Puzzle & Dragons took over 400 days.

Photo: App Annie The game's journey to the one billion mark may be slower, as its growth rate is slowing down. In the U.S. Google Play store, the Pokémon Go app went from number one to tenth place while the app has fallen to 36th place in the U.S. iOS store, according to App Annie data. That's not to say the app is losing popularity overall—it still ranks as one of the top games—but its growth, measured in daily downloads, has slowed. The number of Daily Active Users is also down from a July peak of over 40 million, hitting about 30 million in late August, according to research firm Apptopia.  Pokémon Go has generated over $500 million in revenue and is anticipated to make a billion by the year-red, according to a new report. Photo: App Annie App Annie points out that iOS and Android in-app purchases are not the game’s sole source of revenue. “In addition to McDonald’s Japan, SoftBank announced a partnership with Niantic at the start of September,” writes App Annie. “Under this alliance, the company’s 3,700 stores will be categorized as either PokéStops or gyms.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Smartphone apps now account for half the time Americans spend online Posted Sep 2, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Molotov raises $4.5 million from Sky as part of a bigger round Here’s a stat that’s sure to worry Google: smartphone applications now account for half the time that U.S. users spend online, up from 41 percent back in July 2014, according to a new report from comScore. And when you add tablet applications into the mix, that figure rises to nearly 60 percent. The new milestone was achieved this July, the report says, and is a testament to our increasing reliance on native mobile applications to deliver us the information we need, as well as the entertainment and distractions we crave – things we used to turn to the web for, in previous years. This shift towards apps is exactly why Google has been working to integrate the “web of apps” into its search engine, and to make surfacing the information hidden in apps something its Google Search app is capable of handling.  Our app usage has grown not only because of the ubiquity of smartphones, but also other factors – like faster speeds provided by 4G LTE networks, and smartphones with larger screens that make sitting at a desktop less of a necessity. In addition, the app stores have grown to house millions of downloads – so there really is an app for just about anything you need. In terms of which apps are most popular, a prior comScore report offers some insight. The list of top apps by unique visitors is dominated today by the big players, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Pandora, Snapchat and newcomer Pokémon Go. The apps with the most usage, in order, are: Facebook, Messenger, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Play, Gmail, Pandora, Instagram, Amazon mobile, Apple Music, Apple Maps, Pokémon Go, Snapchat, and Pinterest. What’s surprising about this list is Pokémon’s ranking – something that proves there’s still room for new apps to become giants in what’s now a saturated market. ComScore says that, for as long as it has been measuring digital audiences, there isn’t even a remotely comparable instance of a website or app capturing as large an audience as Pokémon Go did in such a short time. The closest example was Walmart’s app when it debuted its Savings Catcher, which grew by 4 million users to 24 million over the course of 4 months. Pokémon Go, however, became the 13th largest mobile app with 55 million unique users (U.S.) across smartphones and tablets in its first month – or more than 30 percent of the total mobile population. It also ranked 4th in total time spent in app, behind Facebook, Pandora and YouTube. Over a third of its users visited the app daily, too. The latest report from Sensor Tower indicates that Pokémon Go has now surpassed 180 million downloads worldwide, and the average U.S. iOS user is playing the game for 32 minutes per day. It’s also raking in over $4 million in net revenue daily. While Pokémon may be more the exception than the rule, consumers’ app usage has been steadily climbing over the years. This figure grew from 34 percent in 2013, to 41 percent the following year and has now reached 50 percent. In the near-term, comScore expects apps to grow beyond the 50 percent mark as well, but says that both desktops and tablets will continue to maintain critical roles in consumers’ lives for the foreseeable future.

This is root. (AP Images/ Peter Zschunke) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains September 09, 2016 If you want to talk about something important or sensitive, odds are that conversation will happen over the phone rather than email or text. The sound of someone’s voice is an important part of trusting them—but the ability to trust the voice on the other end of that call is human might change. Google DeepMind announced a new speech generation method it calls WaveNet, which could bring artificial intelligence closer than ever to indiscernibly mimicking human speech. The algorithm can easily learn different voices and even generates artificial breaths, according to a DeepMind blog post. DeepMind, the London-based AI firm acquired by Google in 2014, broadly works to “solve intelligence,” a goal that spans health, data center energy efficiency, and ancient Chinese board games. Building audio from scratch is difficult because the data is so dense. Each second of digitally recorded speech (at the quality of a typical phone call) is made of 16,000 different bits of data, called samples. It takes a lot of power to recreate information that granular. Google’s current method of doing this uses AI, but it’s generated in a chunkier way. Imagine you want to make a cup. You can build it with Legos, or use clay. In the Legos scenario, each building block rests on each other to make a complete structure, but each was distinctly created. That’s like Google’s method now, which uses recurrent neural networks. You can listen to that here: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/us-english/parametric-1.wav WaveNet works more like the clay. It’s rolled into a long string and coiled, every part existing in the context of what comes before it. This approach uses convolutional neural networks, where previously generated data is considered when producing the next bit of information. By taking advantage of this continuous generation, DeepMind was able to cut the gap between quality of human and machine generation speech by 50% in blind tests. Listen to WaveNet say the same thing here: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/us-english/wavenet-1.wav For WaveNet to understand what human speech sounds like, it first had to listen. DeepMind researchers fed the algorithm 44 hours of speech, by 109 different English speakers. Results showed that after learning from that wide range of different speakers, the algorithm could model any single speaker that it learned from. WaveNet could even include that speaker’s idiosyncrasies, like breaths and audible mouth movements. Researchers also found that if they fed the algorithm classical music instead of speech, the algorithm would compose its own songs. https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/making-music/sample_1.wav Maybe it should stick to speech, and leave composing to the humans for now.

The para-cyclist, who had already claimed bronze at the past two winter Paralympics in the slalom, won her third in the women’s B3 1km time trial on day two of competition in Rio. “I still can’t believe it. It seems like a long time coming after being banned from Beijing for not being blind enough,” she said. The Melbourne-based rider, who has a vision impairment, was selected for the 2008 Beijing Summer Games but was declared ineligible on the eve of competition, as her right eye was deemed 0.1 of a degree too sighted to legally compete. “It was so bizarre and just completely ironic. At the time it was just complete devastation,” she said. Gallagher and her tandem bicycle pilot Maddie Janssen set a paralympic record on Friday (Saturday AEST) that was quickly eclipsed by British gold medal winners Sophie Thornhill and pilot Helen Scott.

Tweet SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     AFP September 10, 2016, 12:26 am TWN SAN FRANCISCO -- Google on Thursday announced a deal to pay US$625 million for Apigee, a firm specializing in managing the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that businesses use to connect with customers online. <a href="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537134883&cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. For example, APIs can enable a business's computer networks to communicate with apps on smartphones or tablets. Apigee is used by hundreds of companies, including AT&T, Bechtel, Burberry, Live Nation and Walgreens, according to Google. Adding Apigee to its team promises to raise Google's game against major competitors Amazon and Microsoft in the market to provide businesses with services in the internet cloud. Forrester, the independent market-research company, last year predicted that annual global spending on API management would top US$1 billion by 2020. The acquisition is subject to approval by regulators and Apigee shareholders but is expected to be completed this year.

Wi-Fi Assistant allows users to automatically connect to public Wi-Fi networks which Google has determined are fast and secure, even adding a layer of security through a VPN. Now that functionality is rolling out to all Nexus devices, Project Fi or not, in North America and Europe. To access this feature on your device you will need to be running Android 5.1 Lollipop or higher and will need to update the Google Connectivity Services application. Once you’ve done that, head into your settings app, find the Google section, and look for the Networking option. Once there, you should see an option to enable Wi-Fi Assistant if a popup notification doesn’t show up first. After you’ve turned the feature on, it will automatically connect to public Wi-Fi networks automatically. For the feature to connect to a public network, it will require that network to be completely open, meaning no password to connect and no password or confirmation to sign on. The latest update to Google Connectivity Services, version D.1.5.10, is available now on Google Play. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

Users with the old UI will get a quick notification in Hangouts giving them the option to quickly update to the new version of the extension. This new extension works exactly like the app, regardless of platform, and brings all of your conversations into a single window for easy access. It runs in your taskbar just like the app does, but no longer can you have several conversations docked to the bottom of your display. The new experience isn’t bad by any means at all, but it’s certainly not great for interacting with several different conversations at once. If you do want to separate windows, you can pop out individual conversations into their own windows to keep things spread out, although you can’t keep those docked to the bottom of the display. For me personally, this new UI isn’t a big deal on Windows, but on Chrome OS it’s quite disappointing seeing how well the extension integrated into the OS. Interestingly enough, Google still has the Hangouts app available for download on the Chrome Web Store. I guess Google just can’t bear to lose one of its messaging apps… Guides Chrome/OS View THe Guide Google Hangouts View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Comment Following extensive coverage of Google’s capture of government policy making and its agencies, a Google-funded group has responded with a surreal report into “regulatory capture” – allegedly by people Google wishes weren’t there. Unfortunately, the report from the activist groupuscule Public Knowledge (PK) – one of a number of synthetic astroturf non-governmental organizations that take Silicon Valley’s position on telecom and media issues – not only makes PK look very petty indeed, but highlights a democratic deficit in big-money politics. Namely, that if you want to change a law or policy, do it democratically, upfront, and with a popular mandate. Public Knowledge fumes that the US Copyright Office (USCO) is doing its statutory job, which includes ensuring that the copyright system works. PK thinks (and here you must cover the children’s ears) the Copyright Office is “furthering the interests of rightsholders.” Almost every sentient American who has posted an image to Facebook or Twitter is a rightsholder, even if they don’t assert it. Silicon Valley’s great trick is that digital property rights are something that only belong to other people – bad people – thus persuading Americans not to assert their own rights – an inconvenience to the vast corporations that make money from ordinary people’s work. In the report, PK provides us with the useful insight that copyright industries take a greater role in making representations to the USCO than non-copyright industries, which “will not have anywhere near the same incentives as the entertainment industries to maximize their influence.” In other words, industries that require property law to work are more interested in making it work properly than industries that don’t. No shit, Sherlock. The activist group is equally angry that the USCO has inexplicably decided not to weaken or abolish copyright altogether. But it’s actually the job of the USCO to ensure that copyright works – and Congress’ job to strengthen it, weaken it, or abolish the law. To PK, the failure to weaken copyright is a sure sign of a conspiracy. And in a surreal twist, while PK accuses the Copyright Office of furthering a sinister and wide-ranging conspiracy to uphold US property laws, it also says that... nobody listens to the USCO. It “has its views ignored or outright rejected by courts, Congress, and other agencies.” In other words, the Copyright Office’s food is terrible – and even worse, comes in such small portions. What evidence PK has assembled is of a dozen staff moving between the public sector (the USCO) and the private sector over the past eight years. It’s a surprisingly small number, and dwarfed by the hundreds of staff who have shuttled between Google, the White House, and regulatory agencies. It might have been wiser of a Google-funded group not to go there. But it couldn’t help itself, it seems, so like the Light Brigade, charged right in. For tin-foil hatters, it’s here [PDF]. Make sure you have a jar of dead insects handy as you savour it. And isn’t the problem with the world not that you have surrendered control over your photos and words to huge Silicon Valley corporations, but that copyright terms are so long? That could be your first observation. Far too long. ® Bootnote Of course, we can have an internet that allows information to flow freely, but that respects the individual’s property rights. The entire purpose of the propaganda exercise is to persuade us we can have one (the internet) or the other (property rights) – but not both.

Define your site main menu Earn Money for Your Favorite Charities by Switching from Google to Goodsearch If you search using GoodSearch, the company will donate 50% of the revenue they earn from your searches to the charity of your choice. You can choose from over one hundred thousand charitable organizations, including the National Constitution Center, the NRA Civil Rights Defense Fund, and FreedomWorks. Each time you perform a web search using GoodSearch, you earn something around a penny for the charity of your choice. Think about how many web searches you perform every day, every week, and every year.  If you are searching with Google, all of the profits from your searches are going to Google. Switching to GoodSearch gives you control over where some of the revenue you generate goes. Using GoodSearch does not force you to compromise on the quality of your search results either. GoodSearch is powered by Yahoo, which means that you get the same search results as if you searched using Yahoo or Bing. From my testing, Yahoo/Bing is now providing search results which are far superior to Google’s for most searches. Over the last few years Google has slowly been devaluing relevance in the search results in favor of brand authority. Instead of showing you the results which most closely match what you are looking for, Google shows you results which represent what their preferred brand authorities want you to see. If you keep track, you will notice that Google has defined a few large brand sites in each niche which it returns for most searches. Yahoo and Bing have chosen not to bias their search results in this manner, so if you search with GoodSearch you get clean and unbiased search results. GoodSearch provides a browser plugin so that you can search using GoodSearch without changing your existing habits.  With the plugin, you can search from your browser like most of us do now, but earn money for your favorite charity by having your searches processed by GoodSearch.

And you absolutely should do that — it’s always better to be safe than sorry. But before rushing to it, you’ll probably want to back your phone up. Whether you’re moving on to another device or looking to get another Galaxy Note 7 once they have resolved its issues, be sure to take the time to make sure your data is saved for easy transfer to whichever device you’re moving to. Let’s look into your options. Before you do anything No matter how you may choose to back your phone up, it’s important to first contact your carrier to make sure you understand their exchange process. Some carriers may ask for the original device before giving you a replacement. Some will give you a loan device. Some will ship you a device before you have to send yours back. And some will require you to head in-store to carry-out the exchange. Figure out what your carrier does so you can know exactly how to proceed with your backup needs and best determine which of the following methods is right for you. Moving from one Galaxy Note 7 to another If you’re looking to go with another Samsung Galaxy Note 7, there’s a fantastic option waiting for you known as Samsung Cloud. This feature was introduced with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 as the premier cloud backup option for Samsung users. You’ll get 15GB of space to backup photos and video, contacts, notes, apps, app settings, voice recordings, calendar and contact entries and more. Better yet, Samsung lets you backup your bookmarks, call log, app data, home screen layout, device settings, and email accounts. Once you have backed up all elements you want, you can sign into your new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to restore the phone using the backup. The result will be a near-100% representation of your old device. All your files, videos, photos, music, contacts, and more are right where you left them. Your home screen is exactly like it was on your old phone. Settings are copied, too. Your only setup is to log in and press a few buttons. Note that these steps require you to be signed in using your Samsung account. If you don’t already have one, head to Samsung’s Galaxy Apps or the accounts section in the Settings menu to create one. Backing up your entire Galaxy Note 7 using Samsung Cloud Backing up your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is really easy. Here’s how you go about doing it: Go to Settings > Cloud and accounts > Samsung Cloud > Back up my data. Select all of the types of data you want backed up by flipping their respective toggles. Once ready, select the “Back up now” option at the bottom of the screen. Once finished, your data will be backed up to the cloud, and it should be safe for you to return the device. Restoring your Galaxy Note 7 using Samsung Cloud When you’re ready to restore your data on the new device, follow these steps: Go to Settings > Cloud and accounts > Samsung Cloud > Restore. Be sure to select the latest backup you’ve created. It’ll be named something like “Note 7: 9/9/2016”. Here, you can choose to restore some or all elements of your phone, such as call data, apps, and homescreen layout. Select what you want restored to your phone. Press the Restore Now button. The process will complete after some time, and you’ll be ready to go on with your day. Verizon and AT&T users As it relates to Samsung Cloud, here’s a quick warning: Verizon has completely removed the app in favor of their own backup solution. There are workarounds — such as using ADW Launcher to create a shortcut to Samsung Cloud’s activity — but if you aren’t comfortable doing that then you’ll want to explore other options ahead. We should note that this also seems to be true for some AT&T Galaxy Note 7 users and not others. To check if you have Samsung Cloud, head to Settings > Cloud and Accounts > Samsung Cloud. Moving from the Galaxy Note 7 to another Android or Samsung phone Unfortunately, Samsung Cloud is not yet available for all Samsung phones. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will soon get it in a software upgrade, and Samsung’s 2015 flagships will also get it at some point. If the device you’re moving to has Samsung Cloud then we suggest going that route. But if you’re moving to another Samsung phone or a version of the Galaxy Note 7 without Samsung Cloud, or pretty much any other Android phone, you’ll need a couple of things. We feel the combination of Google’s backup option and third-party cloud backup services of your choice is the best route to go. We like all of Google’s options in that regard, so we’ll be focusing on their apps. Be sure to alter any of these steps for your app of choice if you have different preferences. Note: If you’re moving to iOS, then your best option is to use the Move to iOS app Apple has created. The app will transfer message history, contacts, photos and video, bookmarks, email accounts, and calendar entries to your iPhone. For other data, back them up to your computer or use cloud services to transfer them. Backing up your Apps and Google account Using Google’s option, you’ll be able to backup data from apps, Calendar, Chrome, Contacts, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Fit, Google Play Movies, TV and Music, People details, and Google Photos. Restoring your phone from your Google account will re-download the apps you had installed at the time of backup, as well as restoring the app data that was stored in the backup. On your Samsung Galaxy Note 7, you’ll want to follow these steps to ensure your data is syncing: Go to Settings > Personal > Backup & reset. Make sure “Backup my data” is enabled. Also ensure “Automatic restore” is enabled. As for app data syncing: Go to Settings > Data usage Tap the overflow menu (the three-dot menu symbol) at the upper-right of the screen. Make sure “Auto-sync data” is turned on. Backing up your photos and video using Google Photos With the advent of Google Photos, it is ridiculously easy to backup photos and videos in their original quality to Google’s secure cloud servers. These photos will be made available on any device you have Google Photos installed, and they can be downloaded to your local storage whenever you want them. Or you can keep them in the cloud indefinitely and manage them through Google Photos. In case you need help, be sure to check out our previous article showing you how to backup your photos and video using Google Photos. Backing up documents and other files using Google Drive Unfortunately, Google Photos won’t backup anything other than photos and video, but Google Drive will. You can upload almost anything to Google Drive as long as you have enough space. Go through your phone and find the files you want (you can use Samsung’s My Files app to easily traverse your phone’s storage), and use the Share feature to upload them directly to Google Drive. This may take some time to complete, so grab a drink and let it do its thing. Backing up local music tracks to Google Play Music We have a separate section for your local music files because Google Play Music is one of the best places for it (aside from dumping it to a microSD card, which the Galaxy Note 7 now supports). While there are still valid reasons for backing music up to Google Drive — such as being able to upload your playlist files — Google Play Music gives you space to store 50,000 tracks, all of which can be played back from the cloud and managed in a neat user interface. The only way to upload tracks directly from your phone is to first upload them to Google Drive and then sync your Google Drive account to Google Play Music. This method isn’t ideal, however, as large music libraries may eat up a significant portion of your storage limits. To upload your tracks directly to Google Play Music, you will need a desktop PC or Mac that can use the Google Play Music Manager app. Head here for instructions on installing it. Once installed, it’s really easy to get your tracks uploaded: Transfer the music files from your phone to a designated folder on your computer. Select the Music Manager icon . You’ll find this at the bottom right of your screen (Windows) or the menu bar in the upper right corner (Mac). Select Preferences In the “Upload” tab, click Add folder to browse and select a folder you would like to upload music from. Click Upload. Alternatively, you can install Google Play Music for Google Chrome and drag/drop audio files to upload them directly to Google Play Music. When you’re on your new phone, simply download Google Play Music and sign in to access all your music. Because your tracks will have already been transferred to your PC, you can consider that the primary location of your local copies and transfer them back to your new device’s storage, or simply reinsert the microSD card into your new phone if you prefer local copies to be on your phone. If your new phone doesn’t have a microSD slot, you’ll need to transfer your files to its internal storage using a USB cable. When you’re on your new phone The initial setup wizard will prompt you to restore a backup from your Google account. It’ll show you all of the apps and data that will be restored. Confirm the list of stuff you want restored and commence with it. Once finished, you should have all your apps — including the ones we’ve discussed above — installed and immediately ready to use. Most apps’ data should be restored, so their unique data should be waiting for you on the new phone. Your photos will be in Google Photos and you’ll be able to download local copies, if you wish. Google Play Music tracks will be ready in the cloud and available for offline listening if you choose (or, as we discussed before, simply reinsert your microSD card or transfer over USB from your PC to your internal storage). Calendar, Contacts, email, and more should all flow in like normal, too. Enjoy your new device Whether you’re waiting on a replacement or moving on from the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, these steps should make your transition much easier than having to start from the ground up. No matter what backup tool you use or which route you go, it’s important to be thorough in making sure all your data is easily retrievable and restorable. Do research on your tools to make sure you have enough trust in them to handle your data the way they’re supposed to. Above all, be careful about where you’re putting stuff so you don’t wind up wiping precious memories and sensitive files away forever. local_offer    Resources   Samsung   Samsung Cloud   Samsung Galaxy Note 7   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (5) stars Further Reading Get a 64GB Samsung MicroSD for only $22 Galaxy Tab S3 coming early 2017?

Six months after announcing support for Apple's Live Photos, Google Photos for iOS is adding image stabilization to the GIF-like feature. Using the same technology that allows Motion Stills to turn Live Photos into looping clips, the updated app freezes the Live Photo background to erase bumps and shakes. "Now, with the latest Google Photos update on iOS, you can make your Live Photos smoother and more shareable in just a tap," the team wrote in a Google+ post. Apple introduced Live Photos in September 2015 as one of the standout features of its iPhone 6s and 6s Plus handsets. Whenever you take a picture with the function enabled, your smartphone also captures a three-second video surrounding the time said photo was snapped. But the moving images are not easily transferred to non-iOS devices. So, as VentureBeat reports, Google now lets users save Live Photos as .MOV videos, which can be posted to social media and emailed or texted to friends. //Related Articles 17 Tricks to Master Google Photos This update also includes the ability to sort photos in albums chronologically or by recently added. And, based on user feedback, you can now choose a new thumbnail for faces in People. "Fear not—this is also live on [the] Web and [is] coming soon to Android," the Google Photos team said. Similarly, Facebook is testing a hybrid algorithm designed to add a bit of stability to shaky 360-degree videos, in hopes of improving the experience for all users—specifically, those making and watching the clips.

Google’s Clever Plan to Stop Aspiring ISIS Recruits Wired 9/7/2016 Andy Greenberg Google has built a half-trillion-dollar business out of divining what people want based on a few words they type into a search field. In the process, it’s stumbled on a powerful tool for getting inside the minds of some of the least understood and most dangerous people on the Internet: potential ISIS recruits. Now one subsidiary of Google is trying not just to understand those would-be jihadis’ intentions, but to change them. Popular Searches Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.48 +0.06 +0.08% DryShips Inc DRYS ▲ 73.00 +30.14 +70.32% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▼ 24.88 -0.52 -2.05% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 745.71 +2.47 +0.33% Jigsaw, the Google-owned tech incubator and think tank—until recently known as Google Ideas—has been working over the past year to develop a new program it hopes can use a combination of Google’s search advertising algorithms and YouTube’s video platform to target aspiring ISIS recruits and ultimately dissuade them from joining the group’s cult of apocalyptic violence. The program, which Jigsaw calls the Redirect Method and plans to launch in a new phase this month, places advertising alongside results for any keywords and phrases that Jigsaw has determined people attracted to ISIS commonly search for. Those ads link to Arabic- and English-language YouTube channels that pull together preexisting videos Jigsaw believes can effectively undo ISIS’s brainwashing—clips like testimonials from former extremists, imams denouncing ISIS’s corruption of Islam, and surreptitiously filmed clips inside the group’s dysfunctional caliphate in Northern Syria and Iraq.© Jigsaw Yasmin Green, Jigsaw’s head of research and development, who's leading its anti-ISIS search advertising campaign. “This came out of an observation that there’s a lot of online demand for ISIS material, but there are also a lot of credible organic voices online debunking their narratives,” says Yasmin Green, Jigsaw’s head of research and development. “The Redirect Method is at its heart a targeted advertising campaign: Let’s take these individuals who are vulnerable to ISIS’ recruitment messaging and instead show them information that refutes it.” The results, in a pilot project Jigsaw ran early this year, were surprisingly effective: Over the course of about two months, more than 300,000 people were drawn to the anti-ISIS YouTube channels. Searchers actually clicked on Jigsaw’s three or four times more often than a typical ad campaign. Those who clicked spent more than twice as long viewing the most effective playlists than the best estimates of how long people view YouTube as a whole. And this month, along with the London-based startup Moonshot Countering Violent Extremism and the US-based Gen Next Foundation, Jigsaw plans to relaunch the program in a second phase that will focus its method on North American extremists, applying the method to both potential ISIS recruits and violent white supremacists. An Antidote to Extremism’s Infection While tech firms have been struggling for years to find countermeasures to extremist content, ISIS’ digital propaganda machine has set a new standard for aggressive online recruitment. Twitter has banned hundreds of thousands of accounts only to see them arise again—many migrating to the more private service Telegram—while other services like YouTube and Facebook have fought an endless war of content removal to keep the group’s vile beheading and immolation videos offline. But attempts to intercept the disaffected young Muslims attracted to that propaganda and offer them a counternarrative—actual protection against the group’s siren song—have mostly amounted to public service announcements. Those PSA series have included the U.S. State Department’s campaign called Think Again, Turn Away and the blunt messaging of the cartoon series Average Mohammed. Those campaigns are likely only effective for dissuading the audience least indoctrinated by ISIS’s messages, argues Green, who’s interviewed jailed ISIS recruits in Britain and defectors in an Iraqi prison. “Further down the funnel are the people who are sympathetic, maybe ideologically committed, maybe even already in the caliphate,” says Green. “That’s Jigsaw’s focus.” To capture the people already drawn into ISIS’ orbit, Jigsaw took a less direct approach. Rather than create anti-ISIS messages, the team curates them from YouTube. “We thought, what if the content exists already?” says Green. “We knew if it wasn’t created explicitly for this purpose, it would be more authentic and therefore more compelling.” Testing the Theory Jigsaw and two partners on the pilot project, Moonshot CVE and the Lebanese firm Quantum Communications, assembled two playlists of videos they found in both Arabic and English, ranging from moderate Muslim clerics pointing out ISIS’s hypocrisy to footage of long food lines in the ISIS’s Syrian stronghold Raqqa. Jigsaw chose more than 1,700 keywords that triggered ads leading to their anti-ISIS playlists. Green and her team focused on terms they believed the most committed ISIS recruits would search for: names of waypoints on travel routes to ISIS territory, phrases like “Fatwa [edict] for jihad in Syria” and names of extremist leaders who had preached ISIS recruitment. The actual text of the search ads, however, took a light-touch approach, with phrases like “Is ISIS Legitimate?” or “Want to Join ISIS?” rather than explicit anti-ISIS messages. Measuring the actual effects of the campaign in dissuading ISIS recruits isn’t easy. But Jigsaw and its partners found that they at least captured searchers’ attention. The clickthrough rates on some of the ads were more than 9 percent, they say, compared with averages around 2 or 3 percent in the average Google keyword advertising campaign. They also discovered that the hundreds of thousands of searchers spent a total of half a million minutes watching the videos they collected, with the most effective videos getting as much as 8 minutes and 20 seconds average viewing time. But Could It Work? Jigsaw’s program is far from a comprehensive solution to ISIS’s online recruitment, says Humera Khan, the executive director of the Islamic deradicalization group Muflehun. She points out that both Google and Facebook have trained anti-extremism non-profits in the past on how to use their keyword advertising, though perhaps without the deep involvement in targeting, curating and promoting video Jigsaw is trying. More importantly, she argues, attracting ISIS sympathizers to a video playlist is only the first step. “If they can hook people in, can they keep them coming back with new and relevant content? That’ll be important,” says Khan. Eventually, any successful deradicalization effort also needs human interaction, too, and a supportive community backing up the person’s decision to turn away from extremism. “This sounds like a good piece of the solution. But it’s not all of it.” From a national security perspective, Jigsaw’s work raises another glaring question: Why not target would-be ISIS recruits for surveillance and even arrest instead? After all, intercepting ISIS sympathizers could not only rescue those recruits themselves, but the future victims of their violence in terrorist attacks or genocidal massacres in ISIS’s bloody sphere of influence. On that question, Jigsaw’s Green answers carefully that “social media platforms including YouTube have a responsibility to cooperate [with] the governments’ lawful requests, and there are processes in place to do that.” Translation? Google likely already helps get some of these people arrested. The company, after all, handed over some data in 64 percent of the more than 40,000 government requests for its users’ data in the second half of last year. But Green says that the Redirect Method, beyond guiding ISIS admirers to its videos, doesn’t seek to track them further or identify them, and isn’t designed to lead to arrests or surveillance, so much as education. “These are people making decisions based on partial, bad information,” says Green. “We can affect the problem of foreign fighters joining the Islamic State by arming individuals with more and better information.” She describes the campaign’s work as a kind of extension of Google’s core mission “to make the world’s information accessible and useful.” Perhaps one of world’s most dangerous problems of ignorance and indoctrination can be solved in part by doing what Google does best: Helping people find what they most need to see.

Photo: Reuters A team at Google parent Alphabet Inc working on unmanned aerial systems this month will try delivering burritos by drone on a college campus in Virginia. Astro Teller, playfully referred to as the “Captain of Moonshots” at an X lab created at Google to pursue big-vision projects such as drones and self-driving cars, said in a blog post that Project Wing team was ready to launch the test of a prototype drone delivery system. US officials announced last month that Alphabet is joining tests for drone deliveries, as the White House unveiled accelerated rule-making for commercial unmanned aircraft operations. Teller said that a Wing prototype is ready for testing and that the team will run hundreds of flights in Virginia over the course of several days to deliver lunches prepared in an on-site food truck by Mexican food chain Chipotle. “We want to learn how people feel when they’re receiving a package by air, and taking someone’s time and/or money changes things more than a little,” Teller said. “And we want to feel the pressure of unexpected circumstances that show us how we can get better at loading and managing a fleet of planes,” he said. The Project Wing team opted to try out delivering food to create operating challenges including “a lunchtime rush of burrito orders” as well as having to get food to customers hot and in the right shape, according to Teller. “In future tests, we could add a broader range of items, like drinks, which will push us to handle more weight, keep packages carefully balanced, and manage combinations of items on a single flight,” he added. He believes drones will be available within the next decade for important missions such as delivering medicine and other supplies to areas cut off by disasters and helping emergency responders battle wildfires. At a “White House Drone Day” event last month, officials announced steps toward expanding rules for drone operations, including for news gathering and commercial flights over populated areas, after a first set of regulations unveiled in June. “We hope to propose a rule on unmanned aircraft operations over people by the end of this year,” US Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta said. Separately, Google on Thursday announced a deal to pay US$625 million for Apigee, a firm specializing in managing the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that businesses use to connect with customers online. APIs “are vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace,” Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. “They’re the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact, whether it’s a small business applying online for a loan or a point-of-sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer,” she added. For example, APIs can enable a business’s computer networks to communicate with apps on smartphones or tablets. This story has been viewed 1846 times. Comments will be moderated.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Internet Google rolls out new Reviews from the web feature in search Internet Google rolls out new Reviews from the web feature in search By Sohil Nikam - Google recently rolled out a critic reviews feature which allowed critiques from a few reputed websites to show up in search results. User-generated appraisals had no place in this system, with reviews from platforms like TripAdvisor and Yelp getting shunted for this very reason. This status quo lead to some heavy criticism against Google. It looks like the search giant has finally paid heed to the negative feedback by introducing a new ‘Reviews from the Web’ feature. The tool aggregates consumer reviews from up to three websites and adds them to its Knowledge Panels for local places. These critiques include areas of interest like shops, parks and restaurants. As for the sites themselves, they could be anything from a user ratings aggregator to a best-of places list generator. However, the portals would have to meet Google’s review snippet markup and other criteria to be eligible for inclusion. Also Read: Google vanquishes Quadrooter flaws in September Android security patch This essentially means that a person’s review on a platform such as Zomato might show up in Google Search results. As can be seen in the image above, seeking more information about a park will throw up assessments from websites like AllTrails, Facebook and Trekaroo. Even Google’s own reviews could find a place among the three featured. As for critics, they have their own critic review feature in local Knowledge Panels.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google Photos for iOS now lets you stabilize Live Photos Software Google Photos for iOS now lets you stabilize Live Photos By Bindu Nair - Google Photos for iOS has just gotten a massive update which introduces a new feature borrowed from the company’s Motion Stills application. The former can now steady Live Photos through advanced video stabilization technology. Live Photos basically records the few seconds before and after a photo is captured, outputting a short GIF-esque image. However, the results are usually unimpressive, marred by shakiness and blurriness. Moreover, they are a tad difficult to share with Android owners who don’t have an iPhone handy. Google Photos solves both these conundrums in its new update. The app is now claiming that its technology can even out Live Photos so they become more presentable and less shaky. Like Motion Stills, the application freezes the background into a still snap or creates sweeping cinematic pans. Also Read: Google rolls out new Reviews from the web feature in search The system more or less puts the focus into the center of the frame, allowing the Live Photo to be rendered into a smooth looping video rather than a rough collection of moments. This footage is saved to the iPhone’s camera roll and can additionally be shared with iOS and Android users alike. Other than making Live Photos better, Google Photos has also gotten the ability to sort pictures into albums chronologically or recently added, a feature which is already live on its web platform and will be making its way to Android soon. Users are also getting the power to choose a new thumbnail for faces in People. The updated Google Photos app is now available and can be downloaded from the App Store.

But since it was first unveiled in 2014, the team has been quietly toiling away in the shadows and is now looking to ramp things up, partnering with fast food chain Chipotle to deliver burritos to students at Virginia Tech in new trials starting this month. Project Wing emerged out of the semi-secretive Google X lab, the research arm behind some of the company's more audacious concepts such as a glucose-monitoring contact lens, internet-beaming balloons and a little something called Google Glass. The drone-delivery concept relies on fixed-wing aircraft that can take off vertically and lower packages to the ground on a retractable tether. When Project Wing first revealed the technology to the public, it demonstrated the autonomous drones delivering dog food, radios and chocolates at an Australian farm two years ago. It has since continued testing and refining the system on private land in California and is now turning its attention to Virginia Tech, a federally approved testing site where startup Flirtey is also putting its drones through their paces. This will be the first time Project Wing has used its drones to deliver items to external users in the US, though it's not going to be a frijole free-for-all. The trials will take place at a closed site, where participating students and employees will be able to place an order. The food will be prepared by Chipotle in a truck onsite and then delivered to the hungry customers by Project Wing's drones. "We want to learn how people feel when they're receiving a package by air, and taking someone's time and/or money changes things more than a little," writes Astro Teller, the X lab's so called Captain of Moonshots, in a blog post. "And we want to feel the pressure of unexpected circumstances that show us how we can get better at loading and managing a fleet of planes." The tests will allow researchers at Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and Project Wing to study the vehicle performance and navigational capacity, while also gauging the human response to the idea of flying burritos. The resulting technical, safety and user-experience data will be shared with the Federal Aviation Administration, as it continues its efforts to integrate commercial drones into national airspace.

QuickTake Artificial Intelligence U.K.-based DeepMind, which Google acquired for about 400 million pounds ($533 million) in 2014, developed an artificial intelligence called WaveNet that can mimic human speech by learning how to form the individual sound waves a human voice creates, it said in a blog post Friday. In blind tests for U.S. English and Mandarin Chinese, human listeners found WaveNet-generated speech sounded more natural than that created with any of Google’s existing text-to-speech programs, which are based on different technologies. WaveNet still underperformed recordings of actual human speech. Many computer-generated speech programs work by using a large data set of short recordings of a single human speaker and then combining these speech fragments to form new words. The result is intelligible and sounds human, if not completely natural. The drawback is that the sound of the voice cannot be easily modified. Other systems form the voice completely electronically, usually based on rules about how the certain letter-combinations are pronounced. These systems allow the sound of the voice to be manipulated easily, but they have tended to sound less natural than computer-generated speech based on recordings of human speakers, DeepMind said. WaveNet is a type of AI called a neural network that is designed to mimic how parts of the human brain function. Such networks need to be trained with large data sets. ‘Challenging Task’ WaveNet won’t have immediate commercial applications because the system requires too much computational power: it has to sample the audio signal it is being trained on 16,000 times per second or more, DeepMind said. And then for each of those samples it has to form a prediction about what the soundwave should look like based on each of the prior samples. Even the DeepMind researchers acknowledged in their blog post that this "is a clearly challenging task." Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

Speech is becoming an increasingly important way humans interact with everything from mobile phones to cars. Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have all invested in personal digital assistants that primarily interact with users through speech. Mark Bennett, the international director of Google Play, which sells Android apps, told an Android developer conference in London last week that 20 percent of mobile searches using Google are made by voice, not written text. And while researchers have made great strides in getting computers to understand spoken language, their ability to talk back in ways that seem fully human has lagged. Strategy Game WaveNet is yet another coup for DeepMind, which is best known for creating AlphaGo, an AI system that beat the world’s top ranked human player in the strategy game Go this year. Still, Google has disclosed little about how DeepMind’s research has helped it commercially, although the company has revealed that it has used DeepMind’s technology to reduce the power demands of its data centers by 40 percent, saving enough money to justify the amount Google spent to buy the London AI company. It has also said that DeepMind has helped achieve “substantial improvements to a set of services from YouTube and Google Play to Google’s advertising products.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The issues are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments 2 Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 3 Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments 4 Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments 5 Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments 6 Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments 7 Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments 8 Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 8.1 WoSign Response 9 Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) 9.1 WoSign Response 10 Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 11 Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 11.1 WoSign Response 11.2 Further Comments 12 Cross Signing Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Furthermore, when this clause was brought to their attention, they denied that any changes fell under it, and they attempted to suppress further information about the ownership transfer when it was brought to the community's attention. Full details can be found in the post in mozilla.dev.security.policy. WoSign Response Richard Wang writes: "An announcement and disclosure will be made shortly pending completion of the business transaction. We can provide the proof documents to Mozilla to show this transaction is not finished if Mozilla think it is necessary." Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2015, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, who are investigating the issue with Alibaba (owner of the domain in question). This issuance used website control validation, which WoSign has since stopped doing. We await their fuller response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

But a lack of unification and vendor support has, in some cases, stalled its adoption in the enterprise. Initiatives like the Open Compute Project (OCP), however, have increased the interest in open source, as organizations push the concept in their data centers. Here are frequently asked questions that examine recent advances in open source technology, as well as the benefits and challenges of using these technologies in the data center. How does open source technology benefit data center admins? Open source technology can bridge the gap between common data center issues in various locations around the world -- a problem that occurs in one location is likely to occur in another. The sharing of specs and code, along with the flexibility to edit or manage that code based on the needs of specific users, allows administrators to fix problems based on similar situations in other data centers. With open source technology -- be it software, hardware or a cloud platform -- users can minimize the costly IT purchases and upgrades associated with proprietary offerings, and instead utilize code already available through open source sharing. This can also prevent vendor lock-in, as users can pick and choose the features or services they want, based on their needs. What are some of the latest open source projects from the OCP? Google and major telecom companies, such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications, are making waves in the OCP, an open source initiative that aims to push more efficient server and data center designs. When a primary driver to switch to open source is the financial aspect, spending money on the necessary support can create a dilemma. Google teamed up with Rackspace to develop Open Compute servers that will use IBM's Power9 CPU after its release in 2017. The move signifies Google's challenge of Intel's dominance in the CPU market. Google also released blueprints of its 48V server architecture, marking the first time that Google publicized designs through open means. The design focuses primarily on the power mechanisms that Google uses, shifting away from alternating current lines to an approach that reduces cooling requirements and boosts efficiency. In the telecom industry, AT&T and Verizon recently joined the OCP Telco Project with the goal of sharing information on data center hardware and networking. Adoption on a wider scale remains slow -- despite financial and oil exploration companies using the technology -- but cost considerations are pushing companies toward open source channels. What other open source data center initiatives are there besides the OCP? A new data center open standard has emerged that offers an alternative to some of the more complicated designs associated with the OCP. The Open19 project, launched by LinkedIn Corp., attempts to appeal to a wider base than the OCP, focusing on servers and related equipment in a 19-inch data center rack. Using multiple vendors is a way to avoid vendor lock-in -- a big appeal for Open19, as smaller organizations want to find open source opportunities. The project also looks to shrink shared hardware in the rack and remove power supply units in servers. LinkedIn hopes to push the standard into a wider base, while coexisting with the OCP as another option for data center standards across different-sized racks. VMware's new Project Photon -- a container-friendly platform to support cloud-native applications -- was also recently added to the open source mix. In conjunction with the new Photon OS, Project Photon aims to smooth the transition from server virtualization to managing cloud-native apps on an open source operating system. The move signifies a push from VMware toward container workloads, and could be a draw for developers. What's the biggest challenge data center admins face with open source technology? When deploying or running open source technology, the lack of professional support can leave IT scrambling. Even after combing through search engine results and discussion boards, admins still might not have an answer for an urgent question. Professional support is lacking with open source tools, and although some vendors offer support services, they often comes at a cost. When a primary driver to switch to open source is the financial aspect, spending money on the necessary support can create a dilemma. Some larger companies have the resources -- both from a financial and staffing standpoint -- to support open source hardware and software in the data center, but smaller organizations often struggle to do so. When will open source become more prominent in IT, and what's holding it back? Since Facebook launched the OCP in 2011, larger companies have made the shift toward open source adoption -- but smaller ones linger behind. There's no telling when, exactly, open source and OCP will be the go-to when it comes to data center hardware and software infrastructure, as problems with staffing and support still hamper movements for small-scale operations. However, the market for open source platforms such as OpenStack continues to grow. OpenStack revenues will exceed $2 billion by 2017, according to analyst firm 451 Research. Much of that growth will be in the service provider market, but OpenStack distributions and IT training services are projected to drive growth in the enterprise, as well. With over 600 companies in attendance at the 2016 OCP Summit, including Microsoft, Apple, Google and larger financial services firms, the momentum for open source products seems to be picking up steam at big-name companies. The leaders of the pack are making waves in the field, but adoption remains low in smaller data centers. In production-style deployments, OCP is still off in the future.

Google did tell us it was not Penguin, so we should rule that out. Google reminded us that they can and will penalize links by widget makers. Google has penalized Turkey’s largest network, Acunn Media. Google is preparing their announcement on the Penguin launch. I published the monthly Google Webmaster report this week. Google Search Console’s Search Analytics report broke and was fixed this week. Google added reviews from the web to the local knowledge panel. Google said more traffic doesn’t need more links and that the crawl error spike has nothing to do with any update. Google featured snippets now use query expanders. Google is testing bolder and darker AMP logos in search. Google site command can show rich snippets if the quality metric doesn’t meet the requirements. Google AdWords launched “Shop The Look.” Google Analytics real time reporting is all bugged out for some. Google Maps may show a two pack sometimes. Matt Cutts did a rare interview about some of the challenges he faced at Google. It looks like Search Engine Strategies has closed down.

WaveNet, as the system is called, generates voices by sampling real human speech and directly modeling audio waveforms based on it, as well as its previously generated audio. In Google’s tests, both English and Mandarin Chinese listeners found WaveNet more realistic than other types of text-to-speech programs, although it was less convincing than actual human speech. If that weren’t enough, it can also play the piano rather well. Text-to-speech programs are increasingly important for computing, as people begin to rely on bots and AI personal assistants like Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, and the Google Assistant. If you ask Siri or Cortana a question, though, they’ll reply with actual recordings of a human voice, rearranged and combined in small pieces. This is called concatenative text to speech, and as one expert puts it, it’s a little like a ransom note. The results are often fairly realistic, but as Google writes, producing a new audio persona or tone of voice requires having an actor record every possible sound in a database. Here’s one phrase, created by Google. There’s no library of real human voices making the sounds The alternative is parametric text to speech — building a completely computer-generated voice, using coded rules based on grammar or mouth sounds. Parametric voices don’t need source material to produce words. But the results, at least in English, are often stilted and robotic. You can hear that here. Google’s system is still based on real voice input. But instead of chopping up recordings, it learns from them, then independently creates its own sounds in a variety of voices. The results are something like this. Actually, that’s not quite right. On its own, WaveNet only knows a language’s sounds, not its content. Fire it up, and it produces pleasing yet mysterious nonsense, complete with human-like pauses and breath sounds. For meaningful speech, Google shapes the results with linguistic rules and suggestions. But the system itself isn’t specifically tied to speech. It can learn, for example, from piano music, too. Granted, there's already plenty of generative music, and it’s not nearly as complicated as making speech that humans will recognize as their own. On a scale from 1 (not realistic) to 5 (very realistic), listeners in around 500 blind tests rated WaveNet at 4.21 in English and 4.08 in Mandarin. While even human speech didn’t get a perfect 5, it was still higher, at 4.55 in English and 4.21 in Mandarin. On the other hand, WaveNet outperformed other methods by a wide margin. WaveNet isn’t going to be showing up in something like Google Assistant right now — its step-by-step processing system requires a comparatively huge amount of computing power. But Google explains more about the system here, complete with more samples. For mathematical models and other details, there are also two papers posted online.

Comments InfoWorld | Sep 9, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Cloud Computing Application Development Open Source Google Docker Comments The tech world is increasingly awash in containers, and despite stiff competition, the industry seems to be settling on Kubernetes as the default container orchestration engine. Given the options, including Docker's own Swarm, it's worth looking at what makes Kubernetes so popular, especially given its comparative complexity. As with other popular open source software, such as MongoDB and Linux, the answer seems to come down to smart plays in community building -- and 15 years of Google R&D doesn't hurt. Ultimately, this unique blend of exceptional engineering and a willingness to let others take over make Kubernetes such an impressive open source project. [ Find out how to get ahead with our career development guide for developers. | The art of programming is changing rapidly. We help you navigate what's hot in programming and what's going cold. | Keep up with hot topics in programming with InfoWorld's Application Development newsletter. ] Make community real It shouldn't be this way. After all, Kubernetes is a mere two years old (as a public open source project), whereas Apache Mesos has clocked seven years in market. Docker Swarm is younger than Kubernetes, and it comes with the backing of the center of the container universe, Docker Inc. Yet the orchestration rivals pale in comparison to Kubernetes' community, which -- now under management by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation -- is exceptionally large and diverse. Kubernetes is one of the top projects on GitHub: in the top 0.01 percent in stars and No. 1 in terms of activity. While documentation is subpar, Kubernetes has a significant Slack and Stack Overflow community that steps in to answer questions and foster collaboration, with growth that dwarfs that of its rivals. More professionals list Kubernetes in their LinkedIn profile than any other comparable offering by a wide margin. Perhaps most glaring, data from OpenHub shows Apache Mesos dwindling since its initial release and Docker Swarm starting to slow. In terms of raw community contributions, Kubernetes is exploding, with 1,000-plus contributors and 34,000 commits -- more than four times those of nearest rival Mesos. What accounts for these wildly disparate community results? In a word: Google -- or rather, the relative lack of Google. While each of the other orchestration projects comes with a heavy dose of single-vendor influence, Kubernetes benefits from Google's hands-off approach to ongoing development, as well as its original engineering. Meanwhile, Docker, which owns the de facto container standard, has struggled to build a community as broad and deep as Kubernetes has. The reason, as Google's Kelsey Hightower points out, is Docker itself, which has blocked competitors from collaborating around a Docker standard. Docker, of course, doesn't need anyone's input on standardization, but it would appear the market favors less concentration of power at the orchestration layer of containers. Given its need to come up with a viable business model, we should expect Docker Inc. to compete hard to own ops and, hence, orchestration, for Docker containers. But unless the company can turn Swarm into a true industry effort, it's likely to win the container battle but lose the orchestration war, even if it could credibly claim better performance. Google wannabes Behind the community uptake of Kubernetes is exceptional technology. As Google's Borg technology, Kubernetes enjoyed more than 15 years of active development and heavy production. The technology was so good that Urs Holzle, then Google's head of technical infrastructure, reacted with disbelief when a few Google engineers suggested building a version of Borg and open sourcing it: So let me get this straight. You want to build an external version of the Borg task scheduler. One of our most important competitive advantages. The one we don't even talk about externally. And, on top of that, you want to open source it? Those engineers used Borg as a cluster management tool that powered the infrastructure behind Gmail, YouTube, Google Search, and other popular Google services. Later it was built into the Google Compute Engine, but the engineers noticed that customers were spinning up CPUs with terrible utilization rates. A container management system was needed, and they had one running behind the scenes. The trick was to get it out in the open. According to Google product manager Martin Buhr, Google's motivation behind Kubernetes comes down to noble intentions ... and enlightened self-interest. Google hopes an open source Kubernetes will dramatically scale developer productivity and thereby make the world a better place. More selfishly, "We think over time that our deep, comprehensive support for containers on Google Cloud Platform will create a gravity well in the market for container based apps and that a significant percentage of them will end up with us." In other words, let developers and operations teams get comfortable fiddling with Kubernetes so that they'll opt to let Google Cloud Platform make it easy to run. None of this works, however, if Google has a direct monetary interest in Kubernetes, which is something of a poison pill for open source communities. In a nutshell, Kubernetes is rocking because of the 15-plus years of Google R&D that goes into its code, but also because of Google's eagerness to encourage a community to take charge of the next 15-plus years of Kubernetes development.

View all partners Republish this article Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Wherever you go online, someone is trying to personalise your web experience. Your preferences are pre-empted, your intentions and motivations predicted. That toaster you briefly glanced at three months ago keeps returning to haunt your browsing in tailored advertising sidebars. And it’s not a one-way street. In fact, the quite impersonal mechanics of some personalisation systems may not only influence how we see the world, but how we see ourselves. It happens every day, to all of us while we’re online. Facebook’s News Feed attempts to deliver tailored content that “most interests” individual users. Amazon’s recommendation engine uses personal data tracking combined with other users’ browsing habits to suggest relevant products. Google customises search results, and much more: for example, personalisation app Google Now seeks to “give you the information you need throughout your day, before you even ask”. Such personalisation systems don’t just aim to provide relevance to users; through targeted marketing strategies, they also generate profit for many free-to-use web services. Perhaps the best-known critique of this process is the “filter bubble” theory. Proposed by internet activist Eli Pariser, this theory suggests that personalisation can detrimentally affect web users’ experiences. Instead of being exposed to universal, diverse content, users are algorithmically delivered material that matches their pre-existing, self-affirming viewpoints. The filter bubble therefore poses a problem for democratic engagement: by restricting access to challenging and diverse points of view, users are unable to participate in collective and informed debate. Attempts to find evidence of the filter bubble have produced mixed results. Some studies have shown that personalisation can indeed lead to a “myopic” view of a topic; other studies have found that in different contexts, personalisation can actually help users discover common and diverse content. My research suggests that personalisation does not just affect how we see the world, but how we view ourselves. What’s more, the influence of personalisation on our identities may not be due to filter bubbles of consumption, but because in some instances online personalisation is not very “personal” at all. Data tracking and user pre-emption To understand this, it is useful to consider how online personalisation is achieved. Although personalisation systems track our individual web movements, they are not designed to “know” or identify us as individuals. Instead, these systems collate users’ real-time movements and habits into mass data sets, and look for patterns and correlations between users’ movements. The found patterns and correlations are then translated back into identity categories that we might recognise (such as age, gender, language and interests) and that we might fit into. By looking for mass patterns in order to deliver personally relevant content, personalisation is in fact based on a rather impersonal process. When the filter bubble theory first emerged in 2011, Pariser argued that one of the biggest problems with personalisation was that users did not know it was happening. Nowadays, despite objections to data tracking, many users are aware that they are being tracked in exchange for use of free services, and that this tracking is used for forms of personalisation. Far less clear, however, are the specifics of what is being personalised for us, how and when. Data gathering: less complex than we might think. Anton Balazh/Shutterstock Finding the ‘personal’ My research suggests that some users assume their experiences are being personalised to complex degrees. In an in-depth qualitative study of 36 web users, upon seeing advertising for weight loss products on Facebook some female users reported that they assumed that Facebook had profiled them as overweight or fitness-oriented. In fact, these weight loss ads were delivered generically to women aged 24-30. However, because users can be unaware of the impersonal nature of some personalisation systems, such targeted ads can have a detrimental impact on how these users view themselves: to put it crudely, they must be overweight, because Facebook tells them they are. It’s not just targeted advertising that can have this impact: in an ethnographic and longitudinal study conducted of a handful of 18 and 19-year-old Google Now users, I found that some participants assumed the app was capable of personalisation to an extraordinarily complex extent. Users reported that they believed Google Now showed them stocks information because Google knew their parents were stockholders, or that Google (wrongly) pre-empted a “commute” to “work” because participants had once lied about being over school age on their YouTube accounts. It goes without saying that this small-scale study does not represent the engagements of all Google Now users: but it does suggest that for these individuals, the predictive promises of Google Now were almost infallible. Are you an ideal user? EPA/DANIEL DEME In fact, critiques of user-centred design suggest that the reality of Google’s inferences is much more impersonal: Google Now assumes that its “ideal user” does – or at least should – have an interest in stocks, and that all users are workers who commute. Such critiques highlight that it is these assumptions which largely structure Google’s personalisation framework (for example through the app’s adherence to predefined “card” categories such as “Sports”, which during my study only allowed users to ‘follow’ men’s rather than women’s UK football clubs). However, rather than questioning the app’s assumptions, my study suggests that participants placed themselves outside the expected norm: they trusted Google to tell them what their personal experiences should look like. Though these might seem like extreme examples of impersonal algorithmic inference and user assumption, the fact that we cannot be sure what is being personalised, when or how are more common problems. To me, these user testimonies highlight that the tailoring of online content has implications beyond the fact that it might be detrimental for democracy. They suggest that unless we begin to understand that personalisation can at times operate via highly impersonal frameworks, we may be putting too much faith in personalisation to tell us how we should behave, and who we should be, rather than vice versa.

Borrowed from Google’s Motion Stills app which debuted in June 2016, this feature can freeze the background in your Live Photos or create sweeping cinematic pans. “Live Photos bring photos to life with sound and motion, but can suffer from the everyday bumps and shakes that happen when you take photos. Plus, they can be hard to share with friends who don’t have an iPhone,” writes Google. With the latest Google Photos update, shaky Live Photos should become a thing of the past. As mentioned, the app lets you make your Live Photos smoother and more shareable using stabilization techniques originally used in the Motion Stills app. You can save stabilized Live Photos as looping GIFs for frictionless sharing on social media. If you’re interested in how the stabilization algorithm works, check out a quick official explanation on Motion Stills on the official Google Research blog. By the way, this feature runs directly on the device, no Internet connection needed. Other improvements in this version of the app include the ability to select a thumbnail image for faces in the People album, sort photos in albums chronologically or by recently added (also available on the web and coming soon to Android), a simplified process of sharing to YouTube and performance improvements.

(Seeking Alpha) Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and its Google unit are aggressively pushing into the cloud, and investors should view this as a bullish sign for the stock. Deutsche Bank's Ross Sandler commented in a research note on Thursday that his recent channel checks show Google as not only "getting more aggressive" in the cloud space but "gaining traction" under the leadership of Diane Greene. Google has been heavily investing in its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and has committed to over $1 billion in acquisitions in the past year, including its recent acquisition of Apigee. As such, the narrative around GCP being a "distant third place" among major cloud providers "may start to improve" moving forward. Related Link: JPMorgan Shares Several Reasons VMware Is More Attractive Now Than A Year Ago Standing in Google's way of dominating the cloud space is the much larger Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which operates cloud-computing service AWS, and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) — its Azure product is a similar cloud-computing platform. The Battle Begins Sandler further stated in his research report that his channel checks suggest Google is actively targeting "marquee" Silicon Valley customer prospects, many of whom currently use Amazon's AWS service. Google is also aggressively hiring sales reps who will place an emphasis on winning contracts based on its own products and infrastructure and not on price. In addition, the analyst is "also hearing" that GCP will make some "material product announcements" later this month. As such, Sandler stated that his prior $400 million revenue run-rate estimate for GCP in 2016 is too low and a better estimate could be closer to $750 million. "On its 2Q16 call, Google called out Cloud as the primary driver of the re-accelerating growth for Licensing and Other revenue, the first time the business has been called out in pole position," the analyst wrote. Related Link: Hewlett Packard Enterprises Spinoff Leaves Remaining Company On "Wrong Side Of The Cloud" Market Is Big Enough For All Sandler acknowledged that GCP is only a "small but growing" part of Google's business but it is also a segment with "potential upside surprise." Moreover, the cloud space has "ample room" for Google, Amazon and Microsoft to succeed in, so investors should remain long on all three names ahead of the "tidal wave of business flowing to the public cloud.

David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 09.09.16. 09.09.16 Time of Publication: 6:53 am. 6:53 am How Chromebooks Are About to Totally Transform Laptop Design Google Google’s first Chromebook was the kind of laptop you’d design if you didn’t give a damn about laptop design. It was thick, heavy, rubbery, boring, and black. Black keys, black body, black trackpad, black everything. Everything about the Cr-48 was designed to communicate that this device was still an experiment. Even the name, a reference to an unstable isotope of the element Chromium, was a hint at the chaos raging inside this black box. “The hardware exists,” Sundar Pichai told a crowd of reporters at the Cr-48’s launch event in December of 2010, “only to test the software.” Moments later, Eric Schmidt took the stage and preached about how the “network computer” tech-heads had been predicting for decades was finally ready to change the world. “We finally have a product,” Schmidt said, “which is strong enough, technical enough, scalable enough, and fast enough that you can build actually powerful products on it.” Apparently already sensing the skeptical feedback Chrome OS would get, he gestured toward the audience and told them “it does, in fact, work.” For years, the knock on Chrome OS was that it was “just a browser.” A PC, people thought, had to be more than that. But now, almost six years since that first Chromebook, just a browser has turned out to be just enough for a growing group of users. Chromebooks outsold Macs for the first time in the first quarter of this year, and according to Google, US schools buy more Chromebooks than all other devices combined. The CR-48, Google’s first Chromebook.Google Even now, the Chrome OS revolution is only beginning. In the next few weeks, Chromebooks will suddenly have access to the millions of apps in Google’s Play Store, which will work on a Chrome OS device the way they work on Android phones. Also, Google’s beginning a big move into the boardroom, trying to convince businesses to use Chromebooks instead of their old Windows XP machines. And a whole new breed of Chromebooks is about to hit shelves. Not only are they high-end, they’re going to be completely different from the laptops we’ve known before. Getting Online Way back in 2006, Kan Liu started at Google working on Windows apps. Yep, Google used to make useful and popular Windows apps: a toolbar plugin for Internet Explorer, and a Desktop Search app that indexed your computer to make stuff easier to find. Even Liu thought the projects were weird. “If you thought about what Google was,” he tells me, “you’d be like wait, they make a download manager for native apps that you can download on Windows machine?” These apps were supposed to be fast, simple, and secure. But because Google couldn’t control Windows, it really couldn’t guarantee any of that. Boot times really drove them crazy. “Computers used to take, like, minutes to boot up,” says Caesar Sengupta, one of the original leaders of the Chromebook project. Tired of this unacceptable offense, a few people on the team started hacking around on an old netbook in the office, taking out whatever didn’t make sense—like the fact that Windows still checked for a floppy disk every time it turned on. Without even trying that hard, the team hacked together a Linux-based setup that went from off to online in ten seconds flat. Suddenly Google was in the OS business. More Chrome David Pierce Attention, College Students: Chromebooks Are About to Get Awesome David Pierce Review: HP Chromebook 13 Brian Barrett 4 Browsers That Might Break Your Chrome Addiction David Pierce Your Chromebook Will Soon Be Able to Run Android Apps Brian Barrett How to Set Up Your New Chromebook The projects that last within Google—the ones that aren’t Reader or Buzz or Wave or Currents—are the ones that scale. “If you want to do something at Google,” says Felix Lin, the VP in charge of all things Chromebook, “it really only makes sense to do it at Google if what you’re building can touch everybody in the world.” Lin came to Google with a singular mission: to build the company’s browser into an operating system that would make computing and computers accessible to more people. That meant making computers cheap enough so more people could buy them. More important, it meant removing settings, options, icons, buttons, and toolbars in an effort to make computers easy enough that anyone could use them. Particularly the billions of people who hadn’t used a computer before. When the first Chromebooks launched in 2010, anyone who’d ever used a PC decided something felt a little bit…off. “Among the many things you can’t do,” Laptop Magazine wrote, “is view the system properties to see exactly what hardware the computer has, so if you need to know how much free space is left on the system’s internal storage or what type of CPU you have, you’re out of luck. Nor can you control the power settings.” Notebook Review concluded its assessment with the phrase that still haunts Chrome OS: “So…it’s just a web browser?” Thinking about those early reviews makes Sengupta laugh. “The first people who bought Chromebooks were people who were computer folks,” he says. “They looked at the Chromebook and said, ‘This is not a real computer, it doesn’t have very many settings!'” They hated that you couldn’t find your files, or change the time setting. But why in the world, Sengupta argues, would any rational person want to manually change the time on their computer? It should just know. “The amount of work it took to eliminate all the settings,” he says, “so that you didn’t have to care and feed for your computer, was the thing that really made it successful.” The Chromebook Pixel, one of the Google-made Chrome OS devices.Josh Valcarcel/WIRED One place a super-simple, fiddle-free OS took off: schools. They loved that Chromebooks were cheap, easy to administer, and great for multi-user environments. Then it was businesses, which, well, same thing. Next, Chrome OS is out to convert everyone else. The Chrome OS team was a little early to the idea that people could do their work and live their lives inside a tab or six, but history has proven them right. That’s not to say the Chrome OS crew are fortune-tellers, of course. They did miss out on one very important thing: smartphones. You may have heard of them. “Back when we were starting Chrome OS,” Lin says, “the web and mobile were in a dead heat. We were betting big on the web, and the Android team was betting big on mobile.” He doesn’t say the obvious next part, which is that mobile and Android won. The Chrome OS team was right about a long of things, but it never saw mobile coming. There are still times when you want a keyboard and trackpad, though, or a screen larger than the palm of your hand. And lucky for the Chrome team, Android’s also part of Google. So the two teams started talking about how to integrate. They had lots of concerns about performance, integration, and above all security. A couple of years ago, a Chrome engineer ran an experiment: He took containers, a way of separating parts of a system that’s common in data centers, and ran them on a local machine. Android in one, Chrome OS is another. “A few of us saw it,” Sengupta says, “and our eyes literally opened up.” That was the answer. Android apps solve a couple of Chrome OS’s lingering problems. Most important, they bring all the software people are now accustomed to using, onto a new platform. Remember when people used to complain about Chromebooks not having Word? There are now billions of people who now reasonably expect their laptop to have Snapchat and Uber. Apps also offer offline support in a much more robust way, and they bring the kind of multi-window, desktop-app functionality that feels familiar to the old-school Windows users. Of course, they also require totally different things than traditional computer software. Most apps assume you’re using them on small, touch-enabled screens, running on devices with cellular connections and a bunch of sensors that you definitely don’t have in your laptop. So, OK, new question: what does a laptop look like in the age of mobile? New Puzzle Pieces Imagine you want to build a Chromebook. Great idea! Before you can do anything, you have to deal with Alberto Martin Perez, a product manager on the Chrome OS team. Perez is the keeper of Google’s documentation, the huge set of requirements and standards given to all Chromebook makers. The documentation is an ever-changing organism, concerned with everything from how much RAM and battery life a Chromebook needs, to how hard you have to press the trackpad before it registers as a click. If your Chromebook takes more than ten seconds to boot, or the power button isn’t on the top right? Get on the plane back to China and try again. The long, complex document is written in engineer-speak and is remarkably detailed. It’s Google’s first line of defense against corner-cutting manufacturers. When Google decided to integrate Android apps with Chrome OS, Perez and his team combed through the documentation. “We wanted to make sure we were ahead,” Perez says. “It’s really easy to change a web app, it’s really hard to change a laptop.” Google now strongly recommends—which is a lightly-veiled warning that it’ll be mandatory soon—that every Chromebook include GPS, NFC, compass, accelerometer, a fingerprint reader, and a barometer. Those are all smartphone parts that have made little sense in a laptop before. But Android apps are inspiring manufacturers to make devices that move, that adapt, that take on different forms in different contexts. The Acer Chromebook R13 is one the the first convertible Chromebooks. It won’t be the last.Google Computer industry execs believe Chrome OS has come into its own, that people will now choose it over Windows for reasons other than price. For many new customers, says Stacy Wolff, HP’s global head of design, “their first device was a smartphone. And they look for the cleanliness, the simplicity, the stability of what we see in those devices.” That’s the thinking behind the sharp and business-like HP Chromebook 13, the company’s new $500 laptop. Wolf sounds eager to continue down the fancy road, too: When I ask why the Chromebook 13’s not as nice as the Windows-powered Spectre 13, which is one of the best-looking and lightest laptops ever made, he pauses to make sure he’s not giving too much away. “I can’t talk about the future, but there’s nothing that stops us from continuing to go and revolutionize that space.” The $1,000 Chromebook used to be a silly sideshow, Google’s way of overshooting. Soon enough, it’ll be a totally viable purchase. The next few months are shaping up to be the PC market’s most experimental phase in a long time. The addition of Android apps “begs for higher performance hardware and new form factors to support these new use cases,” says Gary Ridling, Samsung’s senior vice president of product marketing. Batteries are more important than ever, as are touch-friendly displays. Windows manufacturers have been experimenting with convertible and detachable devices for the last few years, but the combination of Android and Chrome will actually make them work. The results are already starting to trickle out. Acer announced the Chromebook R13, which has a 1080p, 13-inch touchscreen that flips 360 degrees, along with 12 hours of battery, 4 gigs of RAM, and up to 64 gigs of storage. It’ll only get crazier from here: you’ll see laptops that are maybe more like tablets, a few that are maybe even a little bit like smartphones, and every imaginable combination of keyboard, trackpad, and touchscreen. Google and its partners all see this as the moment Chromebook goes from niche—for school, or travel, or your Luddite dad—to mainstream. “The ability to run their favorite apps from phones and tablets,” Ridling says, “without compromising speed, simplicity, or security, will dramatically expand value of Chromebooks to consumers.” When the legendary Walt Mossberg started his personal technology column at the Wall Street Journal in 1991, he opened with a now-classic line: “Personal computers are just too hard to use, and it isn’t your fault.” 25 long years later, that story’s finally changing. Chromebooks are exactly the computer the world needs now: simple, secure, usable. They just work. And starting this fall, they’ll work the way people do in 2016: online everywhere, all the time, in a thousand different ways. “Personal computing” left desks and monitors behind a long time ago, and personal computers are finally catching up.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 09.09.16. 09.09.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Project Sand Hill: Google’s Unknown Campaign to Track the World’s Hottest Startups Getty Images Google calls it Project Sand Hill. Since 2012, Suman Prasad and his team have worked with various Silicon Valley venture capital firms to identify “rocketship” startups before they really take off, and they help plug them into the Google machine. They help them build apps for Android phones, hook into Android Pay, and make use of countless other Google services, from Google Maps to Google ads. Prasad started the project in his Google “20 Percent Time,” but it has since grown into something much bigger. He’s now director of startups and VC partnerships, and at any given time, Project Sand Hill now serves a good 100 US startups, plus about 30 abroad, including places like Israel, India, and China. Related Stories The Death of Project Ara Shows Google Is All Grown Up Google’s Alphabet Transition Has Been Tougher Than A-B-C Google’s Clever Plan to Stop Aspiring ISIS Recruits Thanks to Google’s Alphabet, .Xyz Will End .Com Dominance Google also runs its own venture capital arm, GV, but it wants another way of tracking the ever-changing tech landscape—and keeping its increasingly enormous company at the forefront of innovation. “The speed at which startups go from being a small startup to becoming a material company was accelerating,” Prasad says. “We wanted to partner up with companies before they came up with the next big thing.” As it continues to evolve from Silicon Valley disruptor into corporate giant, Google is looking for just about any way of keeping itself at the cutting edge. It has even reorganized itself into a new company. Alphabet is a way of cultivating the company’s internal “moonshots,” and Project Sand Hill is a way of keeping as close as possible to moonshots on the outside. In the end, this may be a path to strategic acquisitions. Plus, it can help maintain the profile of all those well-established Google technologies, like Android and Maps. This kind of thing is common practice across the tech world. Apple just opened a new accelerator in India meant to drive new iOS apps in the country. Current members of the program include ticketing platform Eventbrite, fitness-focused My Fitness Pal, and the last-minute hotel booking company Hotel Tonight. And according to Google, eleven Project Sand Hill companies have become “unicorns”—-startups valued at over a billion dollars—since joining the program, including Eventbrite, Houzz and Lyft. About half of the participating companies have gone on to raise an additional $7.5 billion in funding. Google wants another way of tracking the ever-changing tech landscape—and keeping its increasingly enormous company at the forefront of innovation. But where the program may be most useful is overseas. For Google—like so many other American tech companies—the big growth opportunity is in places like India and, just maybe, China, which has so very many people but is traditionally unfriendly to American tech companies. The best way into China is to partner with a Chinese company. Is this a good thing for the startups on the other side of the equation? It is, says Rouz Jazayeri, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, who introduced Google to My Fitness Pal. Initially, he was skeptical, but he quickly saw the value. “It delivered on its promise,” he says. “We had direct relationships and direct engagement with multiple product groups inside Google, and the company made that happen within a very short time frame.” This includes the teams running Google Fit, Android Wear, and Google Play. According to Mike Lee, the company’s CEO, it also got early access to new developer tools and advice on how to optimize Google ads. That just shows you how much Google values these relationships. If companies use its services, it sees, at least to a certain extent, where they’re going. It gets a lay of the land. This is the same side-benefit of running a cloud computing service: a window into the wide market. When you get big, you want as many of those windows as you can find. Go Back to Top.

By Kelly McSweeney for Robotics | September 9, 2016 -- 13:48 GMT (06:48 PDT) | Topic: Robotics Uber Automotive industry stakeholders have touted autonomous cars as being much safer than human drivers. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, so it seems that obvious that adding more automation will make cars safer. However, nonprofit public interest group Consumer Watchdog warns that the rush to deploy self-driving cars is dangerous. "We're very concerned that there is a real press to rapidly deploy these things too quickly," Consumer Watchdog Privacy Project director John Simpson tells ZDNet. "There needs to be very adequate safety precautions and procedures in place." On Wednesday Simpson, on behalf of Consumer Watchdog, sent a letter to Uber urging the transportation company to disclose the details of its self-driving vehicle fleet, which is about to be tested on public streets in Pittsburgh . He wrote, "You have opted to use public roads as your laboratory and with that comes a responsibility to fully disclose exactly what you are doing both when things go right and when they inevitably go wrong." Consumer Watchdog asked Uber to publicly report all crashes involving the test vehicles, plus any technical data and videos related to any crash. The letter also requests monthly reports similar to Google's reports, although it doesn't imply that Google's self-driving program is perfect. In fact, Simpson says he previously sent a similar letter to Google, and he is disappointed that Google hasn't released all of the data and videos from its trials. Lastly, Simpson asked Uber to publicly release "disengagement reports," which are annual reports that describe each time the technology failed. Read this ​Google's self-driving cars involved in 11 crashes Google comes clean on the number of accidents its driverless cars have been in over the past six years. Read More The letter also included a list of questions that he describes as "broader and more philosophical," in an effort to find out more about Uber's long-term vision for robotic cars. For example, "Will Uber's robot car prioritize the safety of the occupants of the vehicle or pedestrians it encounters ?" and "Does Uber have the technology to prevent malicious hackers from seizing control of a driverless vehicle or any of its systems?" We spoke with Simpson about Consumer Watchdog's trepidation with self-driving vehicles. He says that the main concern is that autonomous features are being overhyped and rolled out too quickly, with minimal testing and oversight because everyone -- even NHTSA -- is too enamored with the idea of self-driving cars. In reality, he says, the technology isn't ready yet, at least not with our current infrastructure. He explains: "If every single car on the road was a robot car and they were communicating with each other you might have, in some ways, a safer situation than you have now. But that's not what we've done, and that's not what we'll have for a long time. Right now the average age of an automobile on the road is something like 11-and-a-half years, so people are going to be holding onto their cars for quite a while. As new vehicles out with more and more autonomous driving features, the problem is going to be how those vehicles interact with your traditional car." He raises valid points, such as whether autonomous vehicles should be used in designated lanes. Industrial robots were fenced off from humans for decades, and they are only just now starting to become mobile and collaborative (able to safely work alongside people). So why should robotic cars be any different? Still, Uber's self-driving cars are expected to start picking up passengers on regular Pittsburgh streets any day now. They will have human drivers who are expected to intervene if needed, but as we've seen with Tesla's autonomous features, people tend to expect self-driving cars to do everything. Simpson fears that drivers are ignoring "fine print" style warnings about drivers being ultimately responsible, and they are expecting the cars to do more than they can. Regarding Tesla's autopilot feature, he says, "Even the name itself smacks of a promise that it can't keep." In June, a man was killed when a tractor trailer hit his Model S. Neither the driver nor the car's autopilot system noticed the truck against a brightly lit sky, so the brakes were not applied. Simpson thinks NHTSA "fell down on the job when it came to Tesla," and let the vehicles onto the marketplace without adequate oversight. NHTSA is expected to publish an updated autonomous vehicle policy this year, and that has Simpson seriously worried. He says: "I'm afraid that rather than remembering that their fundamental role is a regulator and protector of safety for highways, the top people of NHTSA have been kidnapped -- well, not kidnapped, but sort of taken over by the industry, and they're going to be out there promoting this whole policy. Mark Rosekind, the Administrator, and Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx are becoming promoters of the technology, rather than careful regulators, and I think that's a problem." While Simpson may be right about the need to proceed with caution, that doesn't mean that self-driving cars should be abandoned altogether. They certainly have the potential to create safer roads, reduce traffic, and let's not forget the convenience factor. People with disabilities such as blindness could gain independence, and commuters could sit back and relax while a robot carries them to their destination. As automakers continue to release new cars with more autonomous features, Consumer Watchdog suggests that drivers will need better training about the technology's limitations, and any company with a self-driving program must be completely transparent. "Answering our ten questions will help the public fully understand what Uber is attempting to do and the risks that are involved," Simpson wrote to Uber. "Full transparency about your planned self-driving robot car testing activities is the only acceptable approach." Consumer Watchdog has not received a response from Uber yet. ZDNet asked Uber and NHTSA for comment and will update the story if it receives one. Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories Innovation Should we ban killer robots?

Lots of vague promises that don’t seem to be fulfilled ... Really it’s about building walls to make it hard to share the best ideas and to collaborate. And he seems to be successful even though he has a crazy user interface. I don’t understand how this works.”  Box CEO Aaron Levie made the joke at the Redwood City, Calif.-based company's annual customer conference, which finished yesterday in San Francisco.  This wasn't the first time Levie has taken a swipe at Trump, but in this case he was supporting the conference's broader message — the "all new Box" wants to take on legacy enterprise content management systems. The company revealed a number of new partnerships and capabilities to support this goal. 'All New Box' Takes Shape Among them was Box Relay for automated workflow creation, the first release from its year old partnership with IBM. The company also announced a partnership with Google, which will integrate Box's file storage with Google's Docs, Sheets and Slides as well as the Google Springboard search engine.   Those were the marquee moments at the conference, but other announcements added to the sense that this was, as Rand Wacker, vice president of Enterprise Products at Box described it, a "watershed" moment for the company.  Jeetu Patel, senior vice president of platform and Chief Strategy Officer at Box, wrote about some of the less glamorous releases aimed at helping developers and customers transform business processes. Beyond the Relay and Google announcements, releases included: Support for new content types: Support for several new file types including HD video, 360 images and videos, 3-D models and VR files. These new file types are available today for web applications and will be available for mobile in the coming months. Annotations and watermarking: New capabilities in the embedded preview of a file that allow end users to add annotations and developers to display a watermark on files that contain sensitive information. Annotations, available today in JavaScript and in the coming months for iOS and Android, allow end users to add point comments and highlight text directly on an embedded file preview. Box also introduced a redesigned developer console, overhauling the user experience and including a new user interface which offers guided walkthroughs for configuring applications, easy access to support, documentation and notifications.  Xerox Launches New Line of Printers Norwalk, Conn.-based Xerox Corp. continues to develop and push out new releases in spite of being in the middle of a restructuring which will see the company split into two companies: a document technology company and a business process outsourcing company.  Like others in the productivity space, Xerox is focused on increasing its products efficiency. Slow print speeds, poor image quality and complicated set ups are a few of the factors that impact productivity when it comes to printers and other document-related software and hardware. Xerox today introduced the Xerox WorkCentre Multifunction Printers (MFPs) and Xerox Phaser 3330, a set of new black-and-white printers that it claims anyone — even the least tech-savvy person in the office — can operate. The printers simplify set up and connect readily to mobile devices. Internal Wi-Fi connectivity and Near Field Communication tap-to-pair allow mobile workers to link their phones and tablets to print from any location.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Warren Report Why Is Facebook Censoring This Iconic Photo? Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Warren Report Why Is Facebook Censoring This Iconic Photo? This is what happens when Facebook’s nudity guidelines clash with powerful photojournalism. (A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgSeptember 9, 2016 10:00 am Email Facebook Twitter Drew Angerer/Getty Images It’s crazy. “Norway’s largest newspaper has published a front-page open letter to Facebook C.E.O Mark Zuckerberg, lambasting the company’s decision to censor a historic photograph of the Vietnam war and calling on Zuckerberg to recognize and live up to his role as 'the world’s most powerful editor.'” (The Guardian) This involves a Norwegian writer posting the Pulitzer Prize-winning shot by Nick Ut of children, including a naked 9-year-old girl, running from a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. Facebook suspended the writer's account, and the paper reported on the suspension with the photo on its own page. It prompted the social network to delete both the paper's article and the photo from Facebook. “Any photographs of people displaying fully nude genitalia or buttocks, or fully nude female breast, will be removed,” said Facebook to the Norwegians. It's a pretty outrageous move over an iconic image, as quickly perceived by Espen Egil Hansen, the editor in chief and C.E.O. of Aftenposten, the country's biggest paper. In his letter, Hansen alleges that Facebook is exhibiting an inability to “distinguish between child pornography and famous war photographs,” as well as an unwillingness to allow “space for good judgement.” “Even though I am editor in chief of Norway’s largest newspaper, I have to realize that you are restricting my room for exercising my editorial responsibility. I think you are abusing your power, and I find it hard to believe that you have thought it through thoroughly.” Hansen contends that instead of achieving Zuckerberg's stated aim to “make the world more open and connected,” the censorship “will simply promote stupidity and fail to bring human beings closer to each other.” Can one really argue? If Zuckerberg cares about matters of justice, he ought be reminded that it is in no small measure through the unadulterated horror of such imagery and reporting that the world gets at basic truth about many human actions, such as war. You've got to stare at our handiwork, not censor it. Geraldo turns on Ailes, calls TV culture endemic In a “Roger and Me” Facebook posting that wasn't deleted, Geraldo Rivera blasted his old boss. “The man we knew as the blustering genius who invented our mighty Fox News Channel is a deceitful, selfish misogynist, if the charges against him are true. And if they are true, then his shame and banishment are well earned. Like virtually all my colleagues at Fox News, I was totally blindsided by his sexual harassment scandal, which is why I responded to Gretchen Carlson’s initial filing of her lawsuit with extreme skepticism. The man she described in her pleadings was unknown even to those of us who thought we knew him well.” (Facebook) The morning chatter you perhaps missed Quinnipiac University should charge the cable news networks for all the time they waste regurgitating every facet of every poll by Quinnipiac, which is based in Hamden, Connecticut. It was the same this morning, especially on “Fox & Friends,” where Trump reporter John Roberts seemed quite upbeat detailing supposed Trump inroads, then this: “Pennsylvania still problematic, Hillary Clinton continues to lead by five points there, 48 to 43.” All in all, it seemed good news for the three co-hosts, let by Steve Doocy, all of whom also defended Matt Lauer's performance theater night. He's being “completely decimated by the political left because he did was too hard on her and he did not destroy Donald Trump,” opined Doocy. Over at “Morning Joe,” Mika Brzezinski went to bat for Lauer, too, with colleagues generally sympathetic to her basic take that he asked good questions of a guy, Trump, who even flummoxed Bob Woodward when he had a go at Trump once on the show. “People say, 'You need to ask the question,'” she said with her preternatural look of chagrin. “We are, people.” Got that? Over at CNN's “New Day,” there was actual reporting, not mere gabbing, on the very same matter, as the network went live to Geneva this morning for trusty international correspondent Nic Robertson to update likely-to-fail talks there about Syria between Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterpart. Yes, it would later be immersed in the presidential horse race, with a “winners and losers” list for the week past. But it was nice to see some actual journalism, too, including a later CNN live report from Tokyo on an apparently serious North Korean nuclear test. Can Google really slow down ISIS? “To deter potential ISIS recruits, Google is trying a new strategy. Jigsaw, Google’s technology incubator, has figured out words and phrases that people associated with ISIS often search for. The aim isn’t to track or identify them, but to change their minds; Jigsaw will seed the search results with ads that link to YouTube channels filled with anti-ISIS videos.” (Popular Science) Got the Hollywood bug? In an attempt to improve diversity in the rather homogeneous world of TV writing, the City of New York is combining with the Writers Guild of America, East, which has had great success of late organizing editorial workers at digital news operations. They'll offer a six-month fellowship to provide opportunities for wannabes from varied backgrounds to work in New York, which was home to 52 scripted TV series last year. The union says the “Made In NY Writing Room” will accept up to 12 applicants, either individuals or writing teams, to take part in the program. They'll get a stipend, participation in various professional development program and be twinned with what's known as a “showrunner” based on their career interests “and produce a table read of their script by union actors.” (Writers Guild of America) Mixed-media marriages Old media is doing lots of heavy investing in new media, like Comcast throwing tons of dough at BuzzFeed. But those alliances “are dotted with cases of new media biting the hand that feeds it.” (Bloomberg) Vice's founder takes old media largesse (notably from Disney) but bashes some as dinosaurs, describing media as a “private club, so closed that most young people feel disenfranchised.” Matthews vs. Giuliani It was a heavyweight matchup as grim and persistent Chris Matthews questioned the breezily self-confident Rudy Giuliani on “Hardball,” largely about Trump's kind words on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his many suggestions that Barack Obama was born outside the U.S. and thus not a legitimate president. Matthews was the anti-Lauer, especially in persisting in not letting the former New York mayor get away with baloney on the birth issue. Seeing Giuliani backtracking was unusual and a universe from the awed reverence he inspires on Fox News Channel. It's intriguing to consider what might happen if you'd had his inquisitorial modus operandi at play in one of the three presidential debates. He can be very effective, if very jarring. (Hardball) Troy Aikman's still pissed Former Dallas Cowboys star Troy Aikman, now a longtime Fox NFL analyst, remains furious that sportswriter/TV pundit Skip Bayless flicked at intimations Aikman was gay in a long-ago Bayless book. He's unfettered in his view of Fox hiring Bayless away from ESPN for its cable sports channel. A few days ago he made clear, “To say I’m disappointed in the hiring of Skip Bayless would be an enormous understatement. Clearly, [Fox Sports president of national networks] Jamie Horowitz and I have a difference of opinion when it comes to building a successful organization. I believe success is achieved by acquiring and developing talented, respected and credible individuals, none of which applies to Skip Bayless.” (Sports Illustrated) Now Forbes contributor Alex Reimer chides Aikman for lingering on the long-debunked rumor, even as he concedes it was pretty sleazy on the part of Bayless. (Forbes) A media writer cut loose Longtime Chicago media observer Rob Feder disclosed “the company's decision not to renew their licensing and marketing agreement on his website, RobertFeder.com.” (Patch He was told it was for business reasons but business includes a pretty thin skin of a new corporate regime. Feder is no bomb-thrower and his coverage of the regime, and its obvious missteps, has been fairly mild. It didn't get much more incendiary that his assessment of the new boss Michael Ferro, the previous boss of The Chicago Sun-Times, changing the corporate name to Tronc from Tribune Publishing: “As corporate names go, it’s even worse than Wrapports, which Ferro inflicted on the Sun-Times before the self-styled tech entrepreneur began his five-year reign of failure there.” What to do with the press and Trump, Clinton The attacks on Matt Lauer for his performance in interviewing the two presidential candidates get to larger questions involving uninspired performances by the press at many events during the campaign year. They were briefly flicked at in tweets after the New York event by Glenn Thrush, a fine political reporter for Politico. I followed up and discussed the matter with him. One issue: What do you do when you ask good questions and politicians simply evade a straight answer? Do you bring out your inner Chris Matthews and doggedly hammer the guy? Here's Thrush: “Polite-but-firm pushback is a skill every serious interviewer needs. Just watch a few YouTubes of the late Tim Russert—or watch debate moderator Chris Wallace on FOX, a very tough interlocutor who—to my complete mystification—declared that his job wasn't to fact-check the candidates. That's bullshit. Fact-checking is job one for any reporter.” (Poynter) A good man Marv Gittler, a beloved Chicago union-side labor attorney and tough teddy bear of a guy, passed away yesterday. We were united by our New York backgrounds, involvement with the labor movement and preference for Jack Daniels. His link to the media largely resulted from representing newspaper productions unions, including workers who struck the Chicago Tribune in 1987 and were replaced. He was a good source of mine, and I was fortunate for his post-strike Solomonic decision to cancel his subscription to the paper but continue being a source. Our primary difference was I remained a Giants fan, while he morphed into a season ticket-holding, long-suffering Bears fan. As I told a son-in-law yesterday, it was thus not unusual in succeeding years to pick up the newsroom phone and hear a gravelly voice simply declare, “So I hear I was quoted in the scab paper today.” Yup. As he lay at rest with a Bears knit cap Thursday (his four daughters thought it only fitting), we toasted him with a shot of Jack. Have a good weekend. Corrections? Tips?

SUBSCRIBE The unexpected impact of Google automated ad extensions What are automated extensions in AdWords, and how can they impact your PPC analytics and ad performance? Columnist Michelle Cruz explains. Michelle Cruz on September 9, 2016 at 9:48 am More When was the last time you reviewed your Google Account settings? I mean really took a deep look under the hood? I know that it’s not something I check often. Recently while analyzing account performance, I noticed a discrepancy in the number of leads obtained at the campaign level and keyword level. This led me to investigate further, and I discovered some interesting things about automated ad extensions. Automated ad extensions Automated extensions use search terms to dynamically generate informational snippets and/or links to your website below your ad text. These snippets help searchers learn more about your business. For example, in this ad you see automated extensions for consumer ratings. Here is a list of all types of Google automated ad extensions: Consumer ratings. Shown in the image above, consumer ratings are industry-specific ratings that appear below your search ad. These ratings are based on survey data collected by Google and its trusted partners, and they usually highlight specific aspects of the business (such as customer service, selection, fees, etc.), which vary by industry. This extension includes a clickable “Ratings” link that allows searchers to see additional ratings. Previous visits. This automated extension lets searchers who are logged into Google know if they’ve visited your site before from search results. The text shows the number of times previously visited, as well as when the last visit occurred. This can help your existing customers and prospects more easily navigate their way back to your website. Dynamic structured snippets. This automated extension is based on your page content. When Google finds information on your website that falls into a particular search category, it may display that information as a dynamic structured snippet if it deems that information beneficial to your ad performance. Seller ratings. Displayed as a star rating from one to five, seller ratings let searchers know how your business is rated. These seller ratings are taken from reputable sources that aggregate business reviews (see a list here). Dynamic sitelinks. This automated ad extension creates links to additional pages on your website below the main link featured in your ad. The links chosen might be based on popular website pages or links to pages related to the search query. (Note that sitelink extensions can also be done manually for better control over the links displayed.) Dynamic callouts. Similar to dynamic structured snippets, this automated extension highlights useful details about your business, products and/or services. (Note that callout extensions can also be done manually, and manual callouts will override dynamically created ones.) Extension display criteria When are automated ad extensions displayed? According to Google, whenever they believe that an automated extension will aid the searcher and improve ad performance. The criteria for showing automated extensions is part of the Google algorithm, and it is currently not possible to know exactly what will enable the extension to show. Keep in mind that if you have manual extensions set up within the account, those extensions will trump the automated extension, preventing it from showing. Conversion reporting Conversions obtained through automated extensions are reported holistically at the campaign level and are included in the total number of conversions reported in AdWords. When drilling down further into the campaign performance, these conversions are noted in the keyword tab under the total account, but are not reported at a more granular keyword level. This causes a discrepancy between account-level and keyword-level conversions. This also means that marketers are not able to optimize account performance based upon the auto extension performance — at the keyword level. To view the conversion data associated with the auto extension you will need to view the performance data within the ad extension tab within your AdWords account. There you will see which extension generated the conversion for the account. The conversion data will be noted under the specific extension category but no other data will be available. Automatic opt-in It wasn’t until I talked with Google about this conversion discrepancy that I learned that accounts were automatically opted into Google’s Automated Extensions when the feature rolled out of beta in August 2015. I believe that many marketers don’t realize this and aren’t aware of the potential impact. You can turn off automated extensions, however, and Google provides instructions for how to do so in the AdWords Help documentation: “To disable an automated extension:  Sign into your AdWords account. Click the Ad extensions tab. Click the “View” dropdown and select Automated extensions report.  Click Automated extension options (advanced). Click Edit next to “Show all automated extensions for this account”. Click Exclude specific automated extensions for this account.  Check the box next to the automated extension you’d like to disable.  Click Save.” My recommendation Digital marketers should realize that AdWords accounts have been opted into this program, and automated extensions may show. In general, my experience with automated extensions has been positive. These extensions typically do increase the total number of conversions obtained. My main concern is that I am unable to optimize the account performance at a granular level. With automated extensions, marketers do not have control regarding what Google is selecting to show to the searcher. Although you can see how the automated extensions are performing within your account, you are unable to optimize the extensions to improve performance. I recommend that you review the available data for your automated extensions. If you see that performance is improving, leave them live and continuously monitor results. Remember, you always have the option to opt out of certain extensions if they are not improving your digital marketing results.

SUBSCRIBE Google has updated the AdWords ad preview tool for expanded text ads The view now includes sample ads and separate views for mobile and desktop. Ginny Marvin on September 9, 2016 at 10:22 am More With expanded text ads now generally available and the October 26 cut-off for being able to upload traditional ads into AdWords looming, Google has updated the ad preview in the AdWords web interface. The update also seems to provide a better indication of whether a headline might get truncated. Spotted by Steven Johns at Door4 in the UK Friday morning, the new preview appears to be rolling out. I can now see it live in accounts. Google Testing New Create an Ad Preview and Sample Ad Feature? #ppcchat #ppc @WordStream @sengineland @GinnyMarvin pic.twitter.com/MuZlM3lD9F — Steven Johns (@stevenjohns21) September 9, 2016 The new preview tool has separate views for desktop and mobile and also has a separate section to view sample ds. Clicking on the View more link brings up a window with several more examples of expanded text ads from various industry sectors like this: In addition to helping advertisers transition to expanded text ads, the new preview tool update is likely also in response to concerns about some ads being truncated. The old version didn’t always indicate when the second headline might be truncated. The new version seems to be much more attuned to this issue. Here’s an example of the preview tool indicating the second headline will potentially be cut off on desktop (it shows fine in the mobile preview): In the example above, the headlines use a lot of high pixel characters (i.e. wide characters) which make it more likely to cut off. Google continues to advise that most advertisers take advantage of all the characters available and says truncation is not common. For marketers in highly regulated sectors that need to ensure full copy is viewable, Google suggests limiting the combined character count of the headlines to 33 characters. For most, however, the focus can be on writing effective ads. If you’re not already testing expanded text ads, here’s a look at some early results and suggestions for getting started.

Although the ins and outs of a handset can vary between phone makers, these Android shortcuts should work no matter what model of phone you're using. Here are 12 gestures you can use on Android that you might not know about. 1) Two-finger swipe down You can access the handy Quick Settings pane in Android by dragging down from the top of the screen to show your notifications, and then dragging down again. But if you use a two-finger swipe from the top of the screen, then the panel appears immediately, giving you instant access to switches for wi-fi, Bluetooth, airplane mode and the like. 2) Press and hold on notifications Google has gradually improved the way Android handles notifications in recent versions, and now everything works pretty smoothly when it comes to alerts. You can swipe to dismiss notifications, and in Nougat , you can press and hold to set preferences for that app. You can do it in Marshmallow too, but the settings aren't shown inline. 3) Press and hold to select Selecting text in Android is a cinch. In most Google apps, press and hold (or sometimes double-tap) somewhere on the screen to select a word, then drag out the handles on either side to highlight additional words. Third-party apps will occasionally behave differently. In Twitter for Android the same action copies text straight to the clipboard. 4) Swipe down from the Chrome address bar Do you have a lot of tabs open in the Chrome browser for Android? Want to switch between them quickly? You can tap on the tab number icon, but you can also swipe down from Chrome's address bar to see your open tabs instead. Alternatively, swipe left or right on the address bar to jump from tab to tab without having to visit the overview screen in between. 5) Press and hold Power Off If you're running into persistent problems with your Android handset then there's a built-in Safe Mode you can use to disable (and troubleshoot) third-party apps. Press and hold the power button to bring up the Power Off pop-up, then press and hold the pop-up to find the Safe Mode option. To get out of Safe Mode, just reboot your phone again. 6) Tap and hold the spacebar Google Keyboard has all kinds of neat tricks up its sleeve, and one that we often find useful is for moving the cursor. Rather than stabbing at the screen to try and position it, just tap and hold the spacebar and then move your finger left and right. It should work in most apps as long as you're in text editing mode (the cursor is already in another word). 7) Triple-tap to zoom in You can triple-tap to zoom in on websites, images, and anything else in Android, but you need to enable the gesture shortcut in the OS settings first. From Settings, choose Accessibility, then tap Magnification gesture and turn the toggle switch at the top to on. Underneath the setting itself you get a helpful explanation of how to use the feature. 8) Tap and hold on menus It's not all that much of a time saver, but we're going to take it anyway. In a lot of Google apps for Android (including Gmail and Chrome), you don't have to tap to open a menu and then tap again. Just tap and hold on the menu button (usually three vertical dots), then drag down to the option you want, then release your finger or thumb to make the choice. 9) Tap and hold for one-handed mode Here's another handy shortcut for the Google Keyboard. Tap and hold on the comma key, then slide up to the icon on the right to activate the keyboard's new one-handed mode. If you don't have both of your hands free then it makes text input much easier. Note that it only works if you're in portrait mode. 10) Long-press on an app icon If you head to the Overview screen (tap the square nav button), then long-press on the icon for an app, you get a shortcut link straight to said app's diagnostics screen (where you can close or uninstall it). You may have to enable developer options for this one to work, which you can do by tapping seven times on Build number in About phone in Settings. 11) Double-tap and hold to zoom An older trick, but one that plenty of people still haven't come across, and it often proves useful on the move. If you're using your phone with one hand, you can double-tap and then hold and drag in the Google Maps app to zoom in and out (drag down to zoom in and up to zoom out). The same trick also works in Google Maps for iOS, by the way. 12) Configure your own gestures This being Android, you can install a few third-party apps to configure some gestures of your own if you're not fully satisfied with the ones that come built into the OS. Draw an S on the screen to launch Settings, and so on. There are a few apps to choose from for the job, including All In One Gestures, Gesture Shortcuts and Finger Gesture Launcher.

By Saurabh Mukherjea, Prashant Mittal Published: Sep 9, 2016 4062 4062 Image: Shutterstock At Ambit we spend a lot of time reading articles that are not directly relevant to Indian stocks. However, since the Indian economy is now umbilically linked to its global counterparts, the articles that we come across have relevance for Indian stocks and the Indian economy. In that context, this report contains the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week. 1) Why the cost of living is poised to plummet in the next 20 years [Source: SingularityHub] Bestselling author Peter Diamandis pulls together a counter-consensus piece. He says “People are concerned about how AI and robotics are taking jobs, destroying livelihoods, reducing our earning capacity, and subsequently destroying the economy…But what people aren't talking about, and what's getting my attention, is a forthcoming rapid demonetization of the cost of living.” As per Diamandis, this drop in the cost of living will come from seven categories which are central to our lives: Transportation (cars will become a ‘service’), Food (cost of food has dropped thirteenfold over the past century); Healthcare (reduced cost of diagnosing and surgery); Housing (people will move out of cities and either use technology to work from home or use autonomous cars for commuting); Energy; Education (most education is already available online); Entertainment. 2) Ram Guha’s proposal to improve governance in India [Source: The Hindustan Times] This piece in argues that “from the level of joint secretary upwards, all government jobs should be subject to open competition. At that level one can bring in professionals with expertise, and yet allow them to grow in the State system, before assuming larger responsibilities.” In the United Nations’ Human Development Report India is a low 130th. Guha says that if we want to reverse this decline we have to bring in professional expertise into the upper echelons of the civil service. This will bring in talent, energy, expertise and the courage to stand up for their views since “to the deference to netas that comes so naturally to the typical IAS officer.” 3) Robots likely to worsen shortage of good jobs [Source: The Times of India] Swami Aiyar points out that all of its vaunted GDP growth, India simply fails to generate jobs. As a result, “When Amroha municipality advertised job vacancies for 114 posts of “safai karmachari” or sweeper, applications came from 19,000 people including MBAs and engineers.” Whilst the fantasists on the Government’s payroll talk about India creating jobs China-style in labour-intensive sectors like garments and shoes, Aiyar points out that is this unlikely to happen due to two reasons: (1) Economies like Bangladesh and Cambodia are beating India hollow thanks to lower wages and duty-free access into many foreign market (which successive Indian governments have failed to negotiate). (2) Robotisation is coming even to labour intensive sectors. 4) The five keys to a successful Google team [Source: Google] Google’s HR team wanted to understand what make a team great. Over two years they conducted 200+ interviews with their employees and looked at more than 250 attributes of 180+ active Google teams. They found that the qualifications and the individual attributes of team members were NOT the key drivers of a team’s effectiveness. “Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.” Google HR’s discovered that there are five key dynamics that set successful teams apart from other teams at Google:  Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed? Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time? Structure & clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear? Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us? Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we're doing matters? 5) The three breakthroughs that finally unleashed AI on the world [Source: Wired] Kevin Kelly explains why AI is about to take off and he seems to have the causal factors nailed down perfectly. Cheap parallel computation: A new kind of chip called a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has been developed to deal with the parallel processing requirements of graphics rich videogames. By 2009 a team of engineers at Stanford were using GPU chips to run neural networks in parallel thus laying the foundation of AI. Big data: “Massive databases, self-tracking, web cookies, online footprints, terabytes of storage, decades of search results, Wikipedia, and the entire digital universe became the teachers making AI smart.” Better algorithms: In the 1950s, scientists realised they needed to “stack” neural networks into various hierarchical layers - to recognise a human face, to recognise the eyes, to go deeper into a specific part of the eye, etc. In 2006 came the second breakthrough. “Geoff Hinton, then at the University of Toronto, made a key tweak to this method, which he dubbed ‘deep learning.’ He was able to mathematically optimize results from each layer so that the learning accumulated faster as it proceeded up the stack of layers. Deep-learning algorithms accelerated enormously a few years later when they were ported to GPUs.” 6) Why the hottest investment trend in the world could have worse economic outcomes than Marxism [Source: Business Insider] Passive investing is by far the defining investment trend of our time. A group of analysts at Bernstein led by Inigo Fraser-Jenkins argue that this trend towards passive reduces the efficiency of capital allocation in the real world. Fraser-Jenkins says that a centrally planned economy will produce better outcomes than an economy with lots of passive investing because there is at least an attempt is being made to optimally allocate capital whereas in the passive investing world there is no such attempt. Jesse Livermore, the pseudonymous finance blogger writing at Philosophical Economics. Livermore says that “it takes merely one active participant to facilitate an efficient market. Passive investing gets rid of the active (and also expensive) investors that stink.” Hence, as per Livermore, rather than make markets less efficient, “passive investing actually makes them more efficient because the only active participants left are competent.” 7) Building a Lifestyle: How the Dubai-based Group became a retail Landmark in India [Source: Outlook Business] The Dubai headquartered Landmark Group has built a successful retailing business in India – a sector in which it is notoriously difficult to make a profit – by spotting fashion trends abroad and then adapting them to India using the help of locally employed designers. Three factors seem to have played a key role: Private labels: Lifestyle has steadily developed private labels as the margins are attractive. The strategy has not been to compete with brands but to complete the offering. Velocity and asset turns: Lifestyle’s rivals says that amongst the leading retailers in India, Lifestyle places orders last i.e. it waits until the latest possible moment before ordering next season’s supplies for its stores. In its value conscious fashion offering, Max, Lifestyle moves goods through the supply chain and through the store at rapid speed. Lean operations: Lifestyle seems to have a leaner organisational structure than any other retailer in India. For a typical store, the firm uses a team of barely 6-7 people. 8) Star Trek at 50: Still an idealistic Enterprise? [Source: Financial Times] Star Trek turns 50 next month and whilst the recent Star Trek movie is nothing to write home about, there is much to celebrate about the original TV series which dominated US airtime in the 1960s. For example, right at the height of the 1960s Civil Rights movement, Star Trek aired an episode showing the lead actor, William Shatner, kissing his African-American lieutenant Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols. Even more impressive was creator Gene Roddenberry’s scripting. Roddenberry, a former air force pilot and LAPD policeman, injected his stories and characters with liberal values, championing toleration, religious scepticism and peace among diverse peoples. Imagine the possibilities if we had TV producers of this calibre in contemporary India. 9) Humans are the main obstacle to the driverless revolution [Source: Financial Times] John Thornhill highlights that “Conventional cars are inefficient, dangerous and dirty..” So what is the way forward? Autonomous cars of course. “The widespread adoption of fully autonomous and, still better, electric cars could therefore be a massive boon to mankind. McKinsey forecasts that 15 per cent of new cars could be fully autonomous by 2030.” The problems that will get in the way. (1) Such cars find it difficult to replicate humans’ sensory abilities; e.g. How does a car distinguish between a plastic bag blowing across the road and a runaway dog? (2) Even if manufacturers of such cars come to fully trust them, it could take decades for consumers and governments to fully trust them not least because of the host of tricky issues posed by such cars; e.g. Autonomous cars will have to programmed to make a calculation that could kill bystanders or passengers to minimise overall loss of life. 10) Poolside working is no longer a sign of importance [Source: Financial Times]  In this typically biting piece, Lucy Kellaway says that this year whilst on her summer holiday she disconnected herself from work altogether and thus came back to her desk feeling refreshed and sharp. She then noticed – thanks to the several “out of office” messages she received – that several other people had begun doing this. In fact, even after multiple emails prompting these holidaymakers to respond, she could not get them to respond. She concludes therefore that “Bragging about not working on holiday seems to be part of a wider trend…in which fashionable execs flaunt not their long hours, but their short ones. To be emailing from the pool does not prove you are powerful, it is starting to be seen for what it is — a sign of weakness, poor time management and an inability to delegate.” - Saurabh Mukherjea is CEO (Institutional Equities) and Prashant Mittal is Analyst (Strategy and Derivatives) at Ambit Capital Pvt Ltd.

Version 2.0, released this week, now gives users the ability to edit Live Photos and turn them into shareable GIFs and video clips, making the images more accessible to those not using iPhones. The feature debuted with the excellent Motion Stills app Google Research first introduced the ability to edit Live Photos earlier this summer with the excellent Motion Stills app. That app searched your Camera Roll for Live Photos and edited them down into GIFs or movies with minimal shake. It was fun and the value was obvious. After all, what’s the sense in having great little clips attached to your images if you can’t share them to, say, Instagram? That feature has been rolled right into Google Photos 2.0. In addition, 2.0 also lets you share video clips on YouTube. For more granular edits, you’ll still need to download Motion Still, but all this represents a welcome update to what’s already a highly competitive photo service on iOS.

Advertisement Description Technical Change Log Comments How To Browse Privately In Google Chrome Google’s game changing browser Chrome combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google’s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available. Speed Perhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. Clean, simple UI Google Chrome’s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn’t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008. Privacy Another hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome’s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences. Security Chrome’s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective. Customization A vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com.

"Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Furthermore, when this clause was brought to their attention, they denied that any changes fell under it, and they attempted to suppress further information about the ownership transfer when it was brought to the community's attention. Full details can be found in the post in mozilla.dev.security.policy. WoSign Response We have not yet had an official response from WoSign or StartCom about this issue. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2015, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, who are investigating the issue with Alibaba (owner of the domain in question). This issuance used website control validation, which WoSign has since stopped doing. We await their fuller response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

In June, Google released Motion Stills an app that can turn Live Photos into GIFs or movies and does an amazing job eliminating camera shake. Version 2.0.0 brings that same functionality to Google Photos. From the menu, choose ‘Save as video’ and Google Photos will save a video version of your Live Photo. It is also easier to upload your videos to YouTube. Select a video, tap share, pick the ‘YouTube’ icon from the share sheet. Google Photos will prepare the file and send it to the YouTube app where you can edit it further before posting if you like. Finally, Google added a couple of user-friendly features to Google Photos. The first is the ability to sort photos in albums either chronologically or by recently added. The second is the ability to change the thumbnail used in the ‘People’ view to a photo of your own choosing. As we saw from the introduction of the iPhone 7 yesterday, photography and the apps surrounding it continue to be some of the most competitive areas in mobile computing. With Google Photos 2.0.0, Google continues to refine its approach to photo management and tie it more closely with its video products. Tags: google, photos Join Now Like MacStories? Become a Member.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Topic News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted For Bloggers PRNewswire Distribution Search Businesses Need Search Experience Optimization Search Experience Optimization or SXO is the practice savvy business site owners will emphasize to 'win' the search game and better serve their customers in 2016 and beyond.   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Search Engine Optimization * Search Experience Optimization * Business Customer Service By Industry: * TechnologyTAMPA, Fla. - Sept. 9, 2016 - PRLog -- "I believe that all brands will become storytellers, editors and publishers, all stores will become magazines, and all media companies will become stores. There will be too many of all of them. The strongest ones, the ones who offer the best customer experience, will survive," (Renowned Businesswoman & Journalist Dame Natalie Massenet, MBE, DBE) What is Search Experience Optimization? SXO a.k.a. Search Experience Optimization is the process of improving the ability of users to positively interact with and experience the elements within a website, such as its content and design elements. Many web-centric organizations leverage tools such as user personas, usability tests, UXA's a.k.a. user experience assessments, etc. in order to deepen their understanding of their target user's online expectations, preferences, and goals. In other words, it's all about building a better, more user-friendly world wide web for everyone. But how do you get millions of website owners and contributors to get on board this progress plane and commit to revamping and building websites with users in mind? Step one: You get search giants, like Google to prioritize and incentivize the process in order to get the ball rolling, worldwide. And Google is indeed beginning to encourage this by rewarding websites that put interaction and experience at the center of development, design, and content for the web with better ranking in their SERP's (i.e. Search Engine Results Pages). As a result, Search Experience Optimization will be an increasingly important focus for today's search and marketing specialists. What Matters in SXO? In order to measure and isolate areas for improvement through SXO, analysts will leverage information from the factors that are most likely to have a heavy influence on the willingness of a site's target customers to visit and interact (e.g. read content, play videos, click links, share data, etc.) within it. This includes the website's speed, navigation layout, mobile responsiveness, etc. Other influencing factors that have remained paramount are content, links, and metadata. All of these factors are taken into account by Google's search algorithm, which directly impact the ability of different websites to rank within SERP's, because they tell search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, etc.) how well the website answers a question posed by a customer in a way that is user-friendly. Site owners can succeed in this venture (answer question and serve customers) by collaborating with experienced search and marketing specialists, to analyze, review, and implement the changes necessary to maximize traffic to and user experience within the site. What's the Future of Search & Marketing? Just as SEO (Search Engine Optimization) has matured and expanded over the years, marketing strategies will be continually adapted and revamped as we forge further into an increasingly digital future. So, you can continue to stay ahead of the curve and better serve your customers by readily seeking new and more effective methods to improve your website to meet customer needs. Collaborate with search and marketing specialists to discover the various qualitative and quantitative insights you'll need to implement responsive changes for your site's visitors, successfully.

It is mostly documented in this WebmasterWorld thread. Some suspect it has to do with an algorithm update but we've covered not just once but twice that these crawl changes in Google Search Console have no relation to upcoming algorithm updates - at least that is what Google told us. John Mueller was asked about this by Simon in the Google Hangout, the last one using Google+, at the 24:07 mark into the video. John essentially said that he looked into some of these reports and yes, it is unrelated to any algorithm thing. He said in the cases he looked up, it was related to the algorithm saying they wanted to double check a lot of old URLs. So maybe GoogleBot felt a burst of energy and was eager to try out a bunch of old URLs. Here was the question: On the 3rd August we saw our crawl errors jump from 1,000 to 10,000 and then on the 1st September, we saw a jump from 10,000 to 50,000. Now, nothing is wrong with the site - these are all crawl errors from two, three, four years ago. And you mentioned to look where they're linked from, is it a sitemap file and so forth. But even the sitemap files referenced in the 'link from’ are two years old. And I'm just wondering - and I appreciate that you've already said that an increase in googlebot activity doesn't mean anything's happening or there's anything to worry about and I appreciate that this is information only and these crawl errors don't mean there's anything wrong although you may want to check if there is. But is there any reason why people are seeing this at the moment? And this sudden increase - is it penguin related at all? John said: No. So I I've seen a few reports like that and I wanted to double check with the team on that as well. We looked into a couple of these reports and they were essentially just our algorithm saying, oh I I have all these old URLs I just want to double check. I’s weird that a lot of these are kind of jumbled together now and like like you mentioned that they're kind of all all on the same time. So I wonder if we will change anything specific there. But it in practice for from a webmasters point of view you don't need to take action on this. For us it's it's also a good good push to try to figure out how we can make these reports a little bit more actionable so that we don't scare people out.

And then, on May 22nd 2013, Penguin 2.0 hit. Alex - New Frontiers Marketing 09/12/2016 08:49 pm I've noticed crawl errors too, and was wondering what was going on. I still suspect some algorithm update may be about to take place. Fun times ahead!

It basically will show you Google Shopping results based on a query that matches cloths out of Fashion Week. Google explained: Let’s say you’re looking for a new outfit to wear to a wedding. If you search for “cocktail attire”, you could see an image of a popular fashion blogger wearing a black cocktail dress, heels and sunglasses. You can shop those exact (or visually similar) products featured in the image by tapping through and exploring the relevant products shown in the form of Shopping ads. As with standard Shopping ads, retailers will be charged on a cost-per-click basis, and all impressions and clicks will be reported within existing Shopping campaigns.

Basically the question was does Google expect a site that sees more traffic to also see more links and if not, the rankings might decline? Here is the actual question: Would you say that the more traffic the site receives from google, the more links and recommendations should that site generate in order to stay ranking and move to a higher level? Here is John's answer: I don't know. Sometimes that happens naturally, sometimes that doesn't happen so naturally. I think that isn't necessarily related directly so it's not the case that we say. oh we send you this much traffic therefore we expect you to get more links over time because of that. That's usually not not the way that it works. Here is the video embed at the start time: Forum discussion at Google+.

Donald 09/09/2016 12:44 pm The goofiness of some of those hangout questions is amazing. Why would anyone think that Google would expect more links as a result of more traffic, or even correlating to more traffic? It's not like Google sees a site with lots of traffic and says "Where is this coming from? Let's downgrade it!"

Rashid Follow InfoWorld | Sep 8, 2016 3:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Java Security Java Android Developer Mobile Mobile Java Comments Google fixed more than 50 issues in multiple libraries, the Android kernel, Mediaserver, various hardware drivers, system applications, and networking components as part of its September Android Security Bulletin. The most noteworthy flaws addressed are the critical remote code execution bug in Mediaserver and a pair of critical elevation of privilege bugs that make up the QuadRooter flaw publicly disclosed in August. [ Android is now ready for real usage in the enterprise. Read InfoWorld's in-depth guide on how to make Android a serious part of your business. | Get the best office apps for your Android device. ] Mediaserver back in spotlight The remote code execution flaw in Mediaserver (CVE-2016-3862) was similar to the set of Stagefright vulnerabilities disclosed a year ago. While Stagefright and many of the later-disclosed Mediaserver flaws primarily focused on video files, this particular bug affected how Android's Mediaserver component processed EXIF (location) data in JPEG images, said Tim Strazzere, the SentinelOne researcher credited with finding and reporting the vulnerability to Google. Android apps typically use a Google-provided library to handle EXIF data, but the bug in the library was causing memory corruption during media file and data processing. "Just displaying a photo in Gmail or Gchat would crash the Android phone," Strazzere said. While Strazzere didn't test social media apps, he said they would also likely be affected by the bug because using that library is the correct way to handle images. Sharing images is common behavior and an easy attack vector. One of the initial workarounds for Stagefright was to turn off autoplay for video files, but there's no autoplay for images. All the attacker has to do is send an image and have the app display the image as a preview to exploit the flaw and remotely execute code on the user's device. Media codecs are notoriously difficult to write safely since they touch multiple low-level components and have to handle different input types, said Strazzere. Developers typically gravitate toward C when dealing with these kinds of operations, but doing so increases the chances of introducing memory-related vulnerabilities. Google could have fixed the bug with what Strazzere described as a "two-line fix." Instead, the company rewrote in Java an entirely new library to handle EXIF data. The Android team could have made the decision because it wanted a more straightforward method to handle the data or because it found more vulnerabilities in the library and decided starting over was best. Regardless of the reason, the decision was "appropriate," as it completely removed a whole class of potential vulnerabilities, Strazzere said. The Mediaserver flaw is fixed for all Android devices and Nexus models running Android 4.4.4 and later. While Nexus devices have received the patches in the bulletin, other Android devices have to wait for carriers and handset manufacturers to prepare the update. Depending on the OEM and carrier, some devices may never receive the update at all. There is no patch for older handsets running Android 4.3 and earlier. Quadrooter completely fixed Google also fixed the remaining two vulnerabilities that make up the Quadrooter flaw affecting multiple Qualcomm components. The privilege escalation bug in the kernel (CVE-2016-5340) and the privilege escalation flaw in the Qualcomm networking component (CVE-2016-2059) could be used to bypass existing mitigations in the Android kernel and give attackers root privileges. The flaws are in Qualcomm drivers controlling communication between different chip components. "An elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Qualcomm networking component could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as High because it first requires compromising a privileged process," Google wrote in the Android Security Bulletin. The other two Quadrooter bugs were patched in July and August. Combining all four Quadrooter bugs could result in complete compromise of Android devices. Quadrooter was publicly disclosed by researchers from Check Point Software at this year's Defcon in Las Vegas. It could potentially affect 900,000 Android handsets, many of them from popular manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola, and all the attacker would need to do is trick the victim into downloading a malicious app. "An elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the kernel shared memory subsystem could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device," Google wrote in the Android Security Bulletin. Nexus devices received the over-the-air update while other Android devices will have to wait for handset makers and carriers to roll out the update. Google published three different patch levels in this month's update: Sept. 1, Sept 5, and Sept. 6. Only devices that receive the Sept. 6 updates will receive fixes for Quadrooter. "Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to the latest version of Android where possible," Google said. This story, "Google squashes another Mediaserver bug in Android" was originally published by InfoWorld.

Photo: Pavan Trikutam/Unsplash It’s time we re-examine the user experience of calling an individual. Voice mail was labeled as the brain child entrepreneur, Gordon Matthew, back in 1979. Throughout the 1980s it gained in popularity, but required such complex systems that only large corporations could afford the technology at the time. Over 30yrs later, the “experience” of calling another person has yet to be re-examined. Visual Voicemail We saw a huge advancement to voice mail in 2007 with the release of Visual Voicemail on a new device called the iPhone. Apple’s Visual Voicemail on iPhone6 Screenshot: Author provided No longer would you have to call your phone and hit “*” or “#” to access voice mail. You could SEE it. It was right there. The person’s name or number When they called Length of the message The city & state the area code was based in This was incredible. What it failed to do was re-examine the purpose behind voice mail. To ask, “why” is someone calling someone in the midst of this text messaging generation. While Visual Voicemail did eliminate the awful process of calling in and listening to voice mails one at a time, the process itself remained unidimensional. The Missed Call Voice Mail From here we began to turn on voice mail. To get upset when people would leave voice mails that just said, “Hey, it’s Jen. Call me back!” Instead, we began to rely on missed calls as a means of saying, “hey, call me back” without actually saying, “hey, call me back.” Voice Mails to Text Google‘s’ transcribed voicemail service through the Google Voice App Photo: Author provided We saw a larger market adoption of this technology when Google added this functionality to the list of benefits included with its Google Voice service. Google Voice has still yet to receive the notoriety it deserves for detaching “phone numbers” from physical devices, but that’s a tale for another time. I’d expect Apple to adopt something similar to voice mail transcriptions in the next couple years. Video Voice Mail Believe it or not we have something extremely similar to Video Voice Mail already, it’s called Snapchat. I had expected Apple to be the first one on the scene with this as a part of FaceTime. The fact that you still can’t leave a FaceTime voice mail is already rather discouraging when you think about it. Though these systems certainly add value to the voice mail system, there’s still an underlying root factor — what is the reason for the call and how do we communicate it? Why Do We Call? Voice mail carries no level of priority with it. I mentioned voice mail being unidimensional because the girl in this photo only has 2 options when she reaches that person’s voice mail box. Why do we call? Photo: Gordon Matthew/Unsplash Leave a message Just hang up and don’t leave a message With the amount of communications performed per day, this method simply does not hold up. We have different needs when calling, different levels of priority. So, let’s break it down. Purpose of Calling: To speak with another individual at that moment Level of Importance: Varies Common Responses: Leaving a name and number with a message requesting you “call back” Priority Messaging What we need is a system in place that allows a user to specify the priority of the call, with the option to leave a voice mail. Currently, taking no action will lead a user directly into a voice mail system — leading to quick hangups, messages saying “call me back”, and the infamous “butt dial”. I propose an action-based system that allows a caller to choose a number, based on the priority of the message. For example: Caller pushes, or says, 1 — text message sent with contact information and a request to call back immediately. Caller pushes, or says, 2 — text message sent with contact information and a request to call back when available. Caller pushes, or says, 3 — text message sent with contact information and a notification that no call back is needed. Caller pushes, or says, 4 — connected to audio voicemail. We already have the ability to move between phone calls and text messages. I believe transcription services take it too far. If I wanted to leave a transcribed version of my message, I could just as easily text it to the person I’m trying to reach. To send a general call back request with a level of priority seems to be a much more valuable use of time and resources for something as simple as connecting with another individual. Do you have any fun tricks, or work arounds to using voice mail? I’d love to know how else you might be using voice mail to communicate with people—if at all.

The program started in August and uses Google Street View Trekker, a wearable backpack with a camera system on top, to capture the images of the trails. It will create a 360-degree panorama that will be in Google Maps. O’Neil said the county is continuing the mapping process, but is still in the beginning stages.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple You can now install Chrome extensions remotely from an Android device Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsSeptember 9, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share A new Chrome Web Store feature allows you to install games and apps to signed-in devices remotely, from an Android smartphone or tablet. It's rolling out in the coming weeks.More Ever find yourself browsing the Chrome Web Store while you’re out, and then you stumble upon a really awesome extension or app, and wish desperately that you could install it right that minute to your idling home computer? It may have once been the stuff of dreams and science fiction, but on Thursday, Google introduced a new Web Store feature that accomplishes exactly that: a button which installs extensions to the desktop or laptop Chrome installation of your choice. It’s simple, in theory. As Android Police uncovered, when you visit an extension’s Web Store page on your phone, you’re presented with two options: sharing it with a friend via e-mail or social media, or “adding it to your desktop.” If you opt for the latter option, an informative pop-up will alert you to the fact that the extension in question will be installed “[to] any computers where you are signed in to Chrome.” Dismiss it, and the extensions will automatically begin downloading on any Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, or Linux machine on which you’ve configured — and associated your account with — Chrome. Related: Google confirms: Chrome OS is getting Android apps and the Play Store The feature is not unlike Google’s remote app installation for Android. Users of Google’s mobile operating system have the ability to install apps and games from the Web to a signed-in Android smartphone or tablet. But remote Chrome app installations, unlike the Play Store feature, appear to lack any sort of management capabilities beyond simple installation. In 2012, Google introduced a “My Android Apps” software management section to the Play Store (which has since become outmoded), that allowed the remote uninstallation of apps on Android devices. Remote Chrome extension installations are relatively painless right now, but are also clunky. There’s no way to trigger remote installations to individual machines rather than to every instance of Chrome to which you’re signed in. And worse, there’s no way to browse the Chrome Web Store from a mobile device — as of publication time, you get an error message suggesting you use a “supported” operating system such as Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, or Linux. But it’s early days. Related: 25 extensions to super-charge your Chrome browser The new feature might be perceived as another step toward a long-rumored merger of Chrome OS and Android. Earlier this year, in May, Google rolled out the Play Store on Chrome OS devices — an addition which saw Chromebooks gain the ability to install and run Android apps. That’s no accident. Last year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai named Hiroshi Lockhimer senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS, and Chromecast. And in 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google had been working for years to merge Chrome OS and Android, and that it planned to launch the result — a new, unified operating system that worked on PCs — in 2017.

In partnership with Google, Ted Baker is running a contest that challenges consumers to spot coded phrases on retail store windows, decode them and speak the phrases into the voice search tool on the app. In return for their participation, consumers have the chance to access more than 26,000 prizes. The project involves geolocation and time stamps, which means that is a user is outside of a Ted Baker retail store at a late hour of the night, the voice tool might offer a playful message that suggests heading home to bed. #1 INNOVATION KEYNOTE VIDEOS Join 5,000,0000 people getting Better & Faster w/ Jeremy Gutsche's Innovation Keynotes ➤ Related Top 10 Slideshows Video Pro Services Innovation Accelerator Innovation Keynotes Trend Reports Custom Dashboards Future Festival Free Resources Innovation Videos & Books Weekly Trend Report NEW: 2017 Trend Report Get a FREE Report Social Adventure CampaignsTed Baker's Interactive Christmas Campaign is a Festive Instagram Hunt Beacon-Embedded MannequinsThe Westfield Ted Baker Store Introduces Location-Based Technology Custom Comic CampaignsOld Spice's Instagram Adventure Has Fans Build Their Own Epic Story Shoppable Fashion FilmsTed Baker's 'Mission Impeccable' is an Interactive and Shoppable Video Top 100 Business Innovations in OctoberFrom Camping Gear Rentals to Night Owl Co-Working Spaces Top 55 Luxury Products in OctoberFrom $21,000 Airplane Seats to Diamond-Encrusted Smartphones Stats for Coded Voice Contests Trending: This Quarter & Popular Research: 267 clicks in 9 w Interest: 0.6 minutes Concept: Google Voice Search Related: 48 examples / 37 photos Segment: Neutral, 12-55 Comparison Set: 18 similar articles, including: social treasure hunts, co-branded grooming events, and men's grooming room flagships.

The added feature means Google Photos can now freeze the background in Live Photos or create sweeping cinematic pans, and save the resulting creation as a looping video. In addition, the latest update to Google Photos includes the ability to sort photos in albums chronologically or by recently added. Google says it has also listened to feedback and users can now choose new thumbnails for faces in 'People' photo collections. Users can learn more about the technology behind Motion Stills stabilization here. Google Photos is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store.

Google's secretive research laboratory is trying to build a fleet of drones designed to bypass earthbound traffic so packages can be delivered to people more quickly. (AP / Google) Relaxnews Published Friday, September 9, 2016 7:05AM EDT Astro Teller, playfully referred to as the 'Captain of Moonshots' at an X lab created at Google to pursue big-vision projects such as drones and self-driving cars, said in a blog post that Project Wing team was ready to launch the test of a prototype drone delivery system. US officials announced last month that Alphabet is joining tests for drone deliveries, as the White House unveiled accelerated rule-making for commercial unmanned aircraft operations. Teller said that a Wing prototype is ready for testing and that the team will run hundreds of flights in Virginia over the course of several days to deliver lunches prepared in an on-site food truck by Mexican food chain Chipotle. "We want to learn how people feel when they're receiving a package by air, and taking someone's time and/or money changes things more than a little," Teller said. "And we want to feel the pressure of unexpected circumstances that show us how we can get better at loading and managing a fleet of planes." The Project Wing team opted to try out delivering food to create operating challenges including "a lunchtime rush of burrito orders" as well as having to get food to customers hot and in the right shape, according to Teller. "In future tests, we could add a broader range of items, like drinks, which will push us to handle more weight, keep packages carefully balanced, and manage combinations of items on a single flight," he added. He believes drones will be available within the next decade for important missions such as delivering medicine and other supplies to areas cut off by disasters and helping emergency responders battle wildfires. At a "White House Drone Day" event last month, officials announced steps toward expanding rules for drone operations, including for newsgathering and commercial flights over populated areas, after a first set of regulations unveiled in June. "We hope to propose a rule on unmanned aircraft operations over people by the end of this year," Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta said. The government has registered more than 500,000 hobby drones in eight months, but sees a need for more rules for commercial operators, he added. The first set of rules stop short of allowing some long-sought applications, including delivery of goods by retailers like Amazon in populated areas. As the world's largest online retailer, Amazon raised eyebrows in late 2013 with its plan to airlift small parcels to customers by drone in select markets less than 30 minutes after orders are received. It has gone to other countries to test its evolving technology, and last month announced plans for test deliveries in Britain. "We're excited about Prime Air -- a future delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using small unmanned aerial vehicles," the online retail titan said in a message at its website. "Putting Prime Air into service will take some time, but we will deploy when we have the regulatory support needed to realize our vision."
