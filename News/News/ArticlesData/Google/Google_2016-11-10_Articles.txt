It’s okay, we know a few types who like to saran-wrap their Jet Black iPhone 7. Fortunately, you have plenty of ways to cover things up. Just as Google has provided some interesting Live Cases for the Nexus phones, it has done the same for the Pixel and Pixel XL. Sure, there are the $40 Live Cases for Places, Photos and a few special artist selections, especially from designer Jeremy Scott. But some new $49.99 cases are coming onto the scene. As with all other Live Cases, the rather simple looking Google Trends case comes with a live wallpaper that shows off the latest top trending searches. The Google Earth Live Case is printed with your choice of Google Earth view and you’ll have the option of pressing the shortcut button to head to that spot on Google Maps. Both cases are on the Google Store and Verizon’s site, listed as “Coming Soon.” In the meantime, you do have the option of taking the durable route with the OtterBox Defender Series cases for both the Pixel ($49.95) and the Pixel XL ($59.95). There’s an inner screen layer, a hard shell and an inner foam lining, all of which should take falls and spills quite nicely. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Messerly By John G. Messerly Reason and Meaning Posted: Nov 11, 2016 I recently read an article in The Atlantic by Tristan Harris, a former Product Manager at Google who studies the ethics of how the design of technology influences people’s psychology and behavior. The piece was titled: “The Binge Breaker” and it covers similar ground to his previous piece “How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds — from a Magician and Google’s Design Ethicist”. Harris is also a leader in the “Time Well Spent” movement which favors “technology designed to enhance our humanity over additional screen time. Instead of a ‘time spent’ economy where apps and websites compete for how much time they take from people’s lives, Time Well Spent hopes to re-structure design so apps and websites compete to help us live by our values and spend time well.” Harris’ basic thesis is that “our collective tech addiction” results more from the technology itself than “on personal failings, like weak willpower.” Our smart phones, tablets, and computers seize our brains and control us, hence Harris’ call for a “Hippocratic oath” that implores software designers not to exploit “psychological vulnerabilities.” Harris and his colleague Joe Edelman compare “the tech industry to Big Tobacco before the link between cigarettes and cancer was established: keen to give customers more of what they want, yet simultaneously inflicting collateral damage on their lives.” [I think this analogy is extraordinarily weak. The tobacco industry made a well-documented effort to make their physically deadly products more addictive while there is no compelling evidence of any similarly sinister plot regarding software companies nor or their products deadly. Tobacco will literally kill you while your smart phone will not.] The social scientific evidence for Harris’ insights began when he was a member of the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab. “Run by the experimental psychologist B. J. Fogg, the lab has earned a cult-like following among entrepreneurs hoping to master Fogg’s principles of ‘behavior design’—a euphemism for what sometimes amounts to building software that nudges us toward the habits a company seeks to instill.” As a result: Harris learned that the most-successful sites and apps hook us by tapping into deep-seated human needs … [and] He came to conceive of them as ‘hijacking techniques’—the digital version of pumping sugar, salt, and fat into junk food in order to induce bingeing … McDonald’s hooks us by appealing to our bodies’ craving for certain flavors; Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter hook us by delivering what psychologists call “variable rewards.” Messages, photos, and “likes” appear on no set schedule, so we check for them compulsively, never sure when we’ll receive that dopamine-activating prize. [Note though that because we may become addicted to technology, and many other things to, doesn’t mean that someone is intentionally addicting you to that thing. For example, you may become addicted to your gym or jogging but that doesn’t mean that the gym or running shoe store has nefarious intentions.] Harris worked on Gmail’s Inbox app and is “quick to note that while he was there, it was never an explicit goal to increase time spent on Gmail.” In fact, His team dedicated months to fine-tuning the aesthetics of the Gmail app with the aim of building a more ‘delightful’ email experience. But to him that missed the bigger picture: Instead of trying to improve email, why not ask how email could improve our lives—or, for that matter, whether each design decision was making our lives worse? [This is an honorable view, but it is extraordinarily idealistic. First of all, improving email does minimally improve our lives, as anyone in the past who waited weeks or months for correspondence would surely attest. If the program works, allows us to communicate with our friends, etc., then it makes our lives a bit better. Of course email doesn’t directly help us obtain beauty, truth, goodness or world peace, if that’s your goal, but that seems to be a lot to ask of an email program! Perhaps then it is a case of lowering our expectations of what a technology company, or any business, is supposed to do. Grocery stores make our lives go better, even if grocers are mostly concerned with profit. I’m not generally a fan of Smith’s “invisible hand,” but sometimes the idea provides insight. Furthermore, if Google or any company tried to improve people’s lives without showing a profit, they would soon go out of business. The only way to ultimately be improve the world is to effect change in the world in which we live, not in some idealistic one that doesn’t exist.] Harris makes a great point when he notes that “Never before in history have the decisions of a handful of designers (mostly men, white, living in SF, aged 25–35) working at 3 companies”—Google, Apple, and Facebook—“had so much impact on how millions of people around the world spend their attention … We should feel an enormous responsibility to get this right.” Google responded to Harris’ concerns. He met with CEO Larry Page, the company organized internal Q&A sessions [and] he was given a job that researched ways that Google could adopt ethical design. “But he says he came up against “inertia.” Product road maps had to be followed, and fixing tools that were obviously broken took precedence over systematically rethinking services.” Despite these problems “he justified his decision to work there with the logic that since Google controls three interfaces through which millions engage with technology—Gmail, Android, and Chrome—the company was the “first line of defense.” Getting Google to rethink those products, as he’d attempted to do, had the potential to transform our online experience.” [This is one of the most insightful things that Harris says. Again, the only way to change the world is to begin with the world you find yourself in, for you really can’t begin in any other place. I agree with what Eric Fromm taught me long ago, that we should be measured by what we are, not what we have. But, on the other hand, if we have nothing we have nothing to give.] Harris hope is that: Rather than dismantling the entire attention economy … companies will … create a healthier alternative to the current diet of tech junk food … As with organic vegetables, it’s possible that the first generation of Time Well Spent software might be available at a premium price, to make up for lost advertising dollars. “Would you pay $7 a month for a version of Facebook that was built entirely to empower you to live your life?,” Harris says. “I think a lot of people would pay for that.” Like splurging on grass-fed beef, paying for services that are available for free and disconnecting for days (even hours) at a time are luxuries that few but the reasonably well-off can afford. I asked Harris whether this risked stratifying tech consumption, such that the privileged escape the mental hijacking and everyone else remains subjected to it. “It creates a new inequality. It does,” Harris admitted. But he countered that if his movement gains steam, broader change could occur, much in the way Walmart now stocks organic produce. Even Harris admits that often when your phone flashes with a new text message it hard to resist. It is hard to feel like you are in control of the process. [There is much to say here. First of all there are many places to spend time well on the internet. I’d like to think that some readers of this blog find something substantive here. I also believe that “mental highjacking,” is a loaded term. It implies an intent on the part of the highjacker that may not be present. Yes Facebook, or something much worse like the sewer of alt-right politics, might highjack our minds, but religious belief, football on TV, reading, stamp collecting, or even compulsive meditating could be construed as highjacking our minds. In the end we may have to respect individual autonomy. A few prefer to read my summaries of the great philosophers, others prefer reading about the latest Hollywood gossip.] Concluding Reflections – I begin with a disclaimer. I know almost nothing about software product design. But I did teach philosophical issues in computer science for many years in the computer science department at UT-Austin, and I have an abiding interest in philosophy of technology. So let me say a few things. All technologies have benefits and costs. Air conditioning makes summer endurable, but it has the potential to release hydrofluorocarbons into the air. Splitting the atom unleashes great power, but that power can be used for good or ill. Robots put people out of work, but give people potentially more time to do what they like to do. On balance, I find email a great thing, and in general I think technology, which is applied science, has been the primary force for improving the lives of human beings. So my prejudice is to withhold critique of new technology. Nonetheless, the purpose of technology should be to improve our lives, not make us miserable. Obviously. Finally, as for young people considering careers, if you want to make a difference in the world I can think of no better place than at any of the world’s high-tech companies. They have the wealth, power and influence to actually change the world if they see fit. Whether they do that or not is up to the people who work there. So if you want to change the world, join in the battle. But whatever you do, given the world as it is, you must take care of yourself. For if you don’t do that, you will not be able to care for anything else either. Good luck. John G. Messerly is an Affiliate Scholar of the IEET.

The shop lets people try out new Google products such as the Pixel phone, Google Home, and Daydream VR. The products will be available for purchase offsite at Verizon and Best Buy retail stores. (Photo : Spencer Platt / Staff) Since its launch last month, HTC's impressive 5-inch Google Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL smartphones have been considered two of the best smartphones around and both incorporate hidden features that make them even more exceptional. Both Pixel and Pixel XL have an electrical switch that can be found at the back located near the "G" logo. Although Google did not explain why there is an electrical switch, this feature presents case makers an advantage and allow them to can create flip covers that can turn the screen on when the cover is opened. Other hidden features include the Night Light that filters out the blue light to get a better night sleep. The Pixel also comes with different hand gestures. Users can check out Settings > Moves and discover the different gestures. Equipped with an 8 megapixel (f/2.4 lens) selfie camera and a rear-facing camera with 12.3-megapixel (f/2.0 lens) so users can shoot a 4K video, Tech Times reported. There is also a must-try Google Assistant though it is only available in the U.S. Users can also opt to boost browsing speed through the Wi-Fi assistant which enabled the phone to switch between Wi-Fi to 4G or 3G networks. The Google phone can also be the answer to security issues with its Smart Lock. The phone also features sensors such as Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Barometer, Compass Magnetometer and Ambient Light Sensors, Gadgets 360 reported. With these sensors device will automatically locked when it is not with the user and is automatically unlocked when it is safe.    With a touchscreen display that has a resolution of 2560 pixels by 1440 pixels at a pixel density of 534 pixels per inch users can liven up their wallpapers. No more boring wallpapers.         Tags Google, Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Pixel XL, Google Smartphone, Google Pixel XL Features, Pixel XL Features © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

Tags : Verizon-Verizon+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ The Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL are the first handsets to be designed by Google. They are both manufactured by HTC, and in the U.S. the only carrier selling the phones is Verizon (more on this 'exclusive' later). One of our loyal PhoneArena readers happened to order the 128GB version of the Pixel XL. According to an email he sent to us today, his phone was supposed to have been shipped today. Instead, he received some bad news. Verizon sent our reader an emailed notification on Friday that probably took the air out of his balloon. Instead of getting word that his 128GB Pixel XL had shipped as expected, he received notification that his order has been delayed. According to Verizon, the phone will now ship on November 26th. "Looks like you have great taste," screamed the top of Big Red's missive. Verizon added that the 128GB Pixel XL is so popular, that the carrier doesn't have enough inventory in stock to ship the order on time. Has anyone else received a similar notification from Verizon pertaining to a delay in the shipping of their 128GB Pixel XL order? We also wanted to point out that even though the phone is supposed to be a Verizon exclusive, it will work with other carriers. You might recall that T-Mobile is running a promotion that will return half the cost of a 32GB Google Pixel ($325) to anyone who has his Pixel activated on T-Mobile. The carrier's CEO John Legere says that the handset has been tested on T-Mobile's LTE pipeline. Verizon delays shipment of 128GB Google Pixel XL by 15-days Thanks for the tip!

Tcanady (Posts: 2; Member since: 4 days ago) So I have been having the WORST time with phones. I have been a Note person for years now. So of course got the Note 7. Of course it was recalled, the first time. Turned it in, got the new one. Waited to get that before turning in my old Note. You know, just in case. Turned in the old one. As soon as they got ir and the credit hit the account they recall the new ones... all of them, banned on flights, blah blah blah. And now I don't have my old phone to go back to. There were no other phones out I wanted. So beginning/mid October I decided the 128 Pixle XL seems like my best bet, given the circumstances and havi5no choice but to find a new phone. Pre order it. Was supposed to ship on October 28th. And now it isn't supposed to ship until DECEMBER 2ND. Meanwhile I'm stil using this phone that Samsung totally dropped the ball on. I made the mistake of doing the stupid update so it only charges to 60% posted on 4 days ago, 07:43 0 Reply 12. solarwhite (Posts: 1; Member since: 4 days ago) i got the same email on a friday, and my pixel XL shipped the following Tuesday - had it on Thursday.

Tuesday November 15, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE Google Nexus 7 tablet release date, news, specs rumors: Andromeda OS to run device for mid-budget market Catherine Salvador 11 November, 2016 3:36 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Reuters/Beck Diefenbach)Google is now believed to release its next flagship tablet before the end of 2016. This year will never conclude without the fans catching a glimpse of Google Nexus 7, which is reported to be released soon. Google has not confirmed anything yet, but it is already expected to be installed with Andromeda OS. The news about Nexus 7 running on Andromeda operating system (OS) may mean that the tablet will be released for the budget-conscious market. According to alleged sources close to the tech giant, Nexus 7 may be announced in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, it is already November and no word has been out regarding the tablet yet. Fans surely know that Google Nexus 7 was rumored to have been renamed as Google Pixel 7 as the company has allegedly decided to ditch the Nexus branding. However, nothing has been confirmed until now as Google has been keeping everything under wraps. If in case Google Nexus will indeed be released this year, the device may battle head-to-head with Apple's iPad Pro. The anticipated handset is expected to have a Snapdragon 820 chipset and a powerful 5,100 milliampere-hour (mAh) battery. Also, the device is said to boast a 4 GB of random-access memory (RAM) and 64 GB of built-in storage. A 13-megapixel (MP) camera is believed to be included in the device, but the most talked-about feature is its operating system, which is a combination of Chrome and Android. Tech enthusiasts believe that if this rumor is assumed true, Nexus 7 will be similar to a desktop computer. Therefore, innovations and powerful features are expected in the tablet. Google is said to be working with a new company to manufacture the imminent device, contrary to the rumor that either HTC or Huawei may be the one to manufacture the Nexus 7 lines. However, this rumor has not been confirmed yet. The only thing that fans are holding on to is the fact that Google Nexus may eventually be announced, though no one knows exactly when. But when it does, it will surely be a reasonable gadget for those looking for mid-budget devices.

Amanda Katherine The search “What is the electoral college?” spiked on Google following Donald Trump winning the election for president of the United States. Many people are wondering where things went wrong in the election for Hillary Clinton despite leading the popular vote. Questions have been raised, and people want answers. Has Donald Trump’s election to be president caused Americans to get more informed about their government and voting system? Get out & #VOTE! #TrumpPence16 #ElectionDay #USA A photo posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Nov 8, 2016 at 1:39pm PST According to Google Trends, the question “What is the electoral college?” is one of the top questions about the electoral college today. It seems that Americans know that something happened with the electoral college vote, which caused Donald Trump to win the presidency, but it is obvious many people were uninformed about what the electoral college even was. American voters did not let us down. The electoral college did. The first woman nominee of a major party for president won the people's vote — Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) November 10, 2016 Donald Trump’s election to be president of the United States has half of the country furious and wondering what went wrong, especially because Clinton appeared to have won the popular vote. It is possible that Donald Trump’s win is causing more Americans to want to become informed about the U.S. government and the voting system in order to understand what is going on.

According to the U.S. Electoral College: National Archives and Records Administration, the electoral college is a process, not a place. It was created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise so that both Congress and the popular vote of qualified citizens would be considered in the election for president. The electoral college has 538 electors. In order to elect the president, there has to be a majority of 270 electoral votes. Tag someone you know who needs to see this. IWillVote.com A photo posted by Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) on Nov 7, 2016 at 12:47pm PST Your state’s number of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation — one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The District of Columbia gets three electors because that is the minimum number of electors allowed, according to the 23rd Amendment. Every state in America, except for Maine and Nebraska, typically give the vote of all of their electors to the candidate who receives the majority of the vote. In other words, if Washington D.C. has three electors and two voted for Donald Trump and one voted for Hillary Clinton, the majority of the votes were for Trump, so he would receive the three electoral votes for the District of Columbia. Some states even require their electors to vote for the candidate who receives the most votes, but even in the states where it is not required, Electoral College members rarely go against the will of the people. According to CNN, the electors from each state in this year’s election heavily favored Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, especially ethnically diverse states like California, New York, and Illinois. Those three states had a combined 104 electoral college votes, which is more than a third of the 270 votes needed to win. Everything we’ve worked toward comes down to today. Like this if you're voting for Hillary. hillaryclinton.com/locate A photo posted by Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) on Nov 8, 2016 at 5:45am PST So what happened? The use of the electoral college system means that a candidate can win the popular vote and lose the election. Prior to this year’s election, back in 2000, Democrat Al Gore was defeated by George W. Bush even though Gore won the majority of the votes nationwide. According to CBS News, Hillary Clinton is the second candidate in modern U.S. history to experience that outcome. The other two occurrences were back in the 19th century. Even Donald Trump has reportedly trashed the electoral college in the past. He reportedly deleted tweets that he posted back in 2012. “The phony electoral college made a laughing stock out of our nation. The loser one! He lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a revolution in this country!” ???? A photo posted by Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) on Oct 27, 2016 at 7:55pm PDT Many people are wondering why there is even a need for the electoral college anymore. Hundreds of proposals have been introduced in Congress to get rid of the electoral college. However, few have ever gained any momentum to move forward because of how challenging it is to amend the Constitution. There is one proposal to implement a plan that would elect the president based on the national popular vote, and it has slowly been gaining momentum across the U.S. over the last decade. The plan was introduced in 50 legislatures and 10 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have passed this legislation totaling 165 electoral votes.

Back when the Android 7 Nougat was in developer preview mode, Google gave a glimpse of Android’s ‘Night Mode’ feature that is similar to Apple’s Night Shift. The feature did create a stir as it was one of the most requested features. Being in developer preview, users were hoping that it would be made available in Android 7.0 final release, but that didn’t happen as it was pulled by Google just before the final release as the ‘Night Mode’ wasn’t completely ready. After the feature was removed from the final build of Nougat, a thread named “Bring Back Night Mode” was posted on company’s issue tracker. Now, the search giant has changed its status to ‘Future Release’. This indicates that the night mode is likely to come back in a future release, possibly the upcoming Android 7.1 Nougat update. Of course users might have to wait for longer if the company decides to push out the feature with a future update. The ‘Night Mode’ essentially adjusts the screen colour temperature in order to prevent excessive strain on user’s eyes. There have always been apps that can help users adjust the screen colour temperature, such as f.lux, but system-level integration makes this feature extremely useful. Regarding the removal of night mode features in the Android N, a team of Google Engineers had earlier revealed that both dark theme and screen tinting had to be abandoned for similar reasons. The team claimed that both these were not going to be ready by the time Android N was launched publicly. Further, the team said that it did not want to leave a “half-working” feature in the platform. The team pointed out that the implementation on an ecosystem-wide scale was difficult, and work on the features was not judged to be a sound allocation of resources.

It allows the users to go through thousands of news stories and magazines, all in one app. It provides breaking news updates, as well as audio and video coverage. The app has over a billion downloads on the Google Play Store (mostly by virtue of being pre-loaded) and is a popular app among content consumers. The latest update to the app bumps it up to the Google Play Newsstand 4.0.0 The app covers a number of topics ranging from sports to fitness to business to tech, among many others. It provides free as well as paid news content to the users. With this new update, the Google Play Newsstand now gets the material design update! This was one of the few apps which had this update long overdue, and has finally received it. A bottom navigation bar has been introduced to the Google Play Newsstand, as well as a ‘For You’ section which delivers personalized content based on the users interest. The search bar on the top now shows the trending content as well. The search bar hides when scrolling, which makes it quite easy to use the app. This newly introduced For You section replaces the ‘Read Now’. The suggested content in the For You section now provides personalized data based on search history and acts similar to the Google Now cards. In addition to all this, the newly updated Google Play Newsstand app also provides personalized highlights, featured topics with articles curated by editors, as well as local stories and editor picks. To sum it up, the update brings a fine mixture of UI/UX changes and a welcome move of personalized content. Google gets a major edge over various other news curators, as it has access to the search history of the users and can provide more relevant news which will make the users engage more and more with the app. SOURCE9to5 Google TAGS Google Newsstand SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGoogle Chrome Now Boasts of 2 Billion Users Next articleAmazon Ordered to Refund In-App Purchases Made by Children Debshikha Banerjee Debshikha Banerjee is known as Gadget Girl, She currently owns the OnePlus Two and keeps trying new things on it.

Toggle navigation Financials Consumer Discretionary Technology Energy Gaming Healthcare Industrials Sports Video Toggle navigation Home About us Contact Us Authors US Edition November 15, 2016 Financials Consumer Discretionary Technology Energy Gaming Healthcare Industrials Sports Video Google Home Could Do With a Few Tips from the Amazon Echo Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon GOOGL AMZN Google Home smart-speaker has been the cause of some speculation online, putting in constant comparison with Amazon’s smart-home controller, the Echo Google Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) debut of its bluetooth speaker, the Google Home, has received mixed reviews. As the trend of using smart-speakers to control smart home appliances continue to bolster, it seems that the tech giant’s launch of its smart-device has led it in to direct comparison with devices like Amazon’s Echo. Even though the company’s smart-speaker has been integrated with various capabilities, it appears that the device is still not as up to the mark as customers expected. We believe this reaction has mainly surfaced due to individuals’ high expectations of smart-speakers in markets thanks to Amazon. With the advent of the Echo speaker in 2014, Amazon successfully managed to set the bar high for similar devices to follow, and till now, nobody seems to have overshadowed the Echo’s success.  Considering that the voice activated speaker aims to perform as the main smart-home hub for its owners, it’s essential for Google to consider ramping up its offerings in order to capture more markets. As the Echo continues to thrive in markets thanks to its long list of offerings, many users have become accustomed to having access to control third-party services and apps through their smart-speakers. Whether it means ordering a pizza, calling an Uber or playing music; Amazon has covered its tracks well. The e-commerce giant’s decision to integrate its smart-speak with up to 3,200 skills has worked out as a great promotional boost for the Echo’s capabilities in markets. Through this, Amazon not only managed to promote its virtual assistant Alexa, but also got a head-start in promoting the concept of building smart homes. While Google Home has managed to integrate support for Chromecast along with the ability to listen to on-demand podcasts, there is a high probability that the tech giant will continue perfecting the Google Home speaker in the subsequent future. However, for now, we believe that the company may not experience excellent sales for its speaker during the holiday season since Amazon has cleverly chosen to price the Echo at a cheaper rate. The Google Home is priced at $129 for interested buyers. Since the company operates as one of the dominant tech companies in competitive markets, we believe Google Home has high chances to eventually eliminate competition from Amazon in the subsequent future. For now, it appears that the company is simply hoping to take advantage of users’ new-found interest in buying voice-controlled devices to run their smart homes.

Now, it seems like Apple is following suit — at least a little. The company has quietly launched a support app on the App Store. The app represents a slightly less hands-on approach from Apple, which has traditionally offered more personal support through avenues like the Apple Store. Clearly, the goal here is to help people quickly and easily without them having to come into the Apple Store every time something goes wrong. More: Apple seemingly getting some 2016 MacBook Pro orders ready for shipment The app basically includes help articles for popular topics, and it actually doesn’t stop at the iPhone — users can get help with their Macs and other Apple devices too. When you open the app up, you’ll see a list of devices registered to your Apple account, with help articles for each of them. Thankfully, the app doesn’t stop there — it also offers a live chat feature, so if you can’t find the help you need from the articles, you can get more personal help from an Apple support representative. Not only that, but if you can’t find what you need through the chat feature, you can then call a support agent. Last but not least, if all else fails, you can schedule an appointment at the nearest Apple Store. It seems as though the app is currently only being offered in English, but it’s available in a number of countries around the world, and it is likely we’ll see it open up to more languages in the future. It’s also likely we’ll see the app pre-loaded on future versions of the iPhone. You can get the app for yourself here.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Technology: Controller is a dream with new virtual-reality headset By ANICK JESDANUN/The Associated Press Nov 11, 2016 (…) Eric Risberg FILE - In this Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, Dan Howley tries out the Google Daydream View virtual-reality headset and controller following a product event, in San Francisco. Google’s Daydream View virtual-reality headset sets itself apart by including a handheld controller that responds to gestures and other movement. It’s a fine device for its price, but it still needs more apps to make its potential more than a dream. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) NEW YORK — The best thing about Google’s new virtual-reality headset isn’t the headset at all. In fact, Daydream View would pale compared with Samsung’s Gear VR headset were it not for Daydream’s controller, a handheld device that responds to gestures and other motion. With Gear VR, I have to move my head to point a cursor at something, then reach for a button on the headset. With Daydream, I can just aim and click the controller in my hand. Sensors in the device tell the headset what I’m trying to do, whether it’s swinging a tennis racket or casting a fishing rod. The headset’s display responds accordingly. The headset and controller are sold together for $79. No rush in getting one, though, as the virtual experiences built for Daydream are still limited. And for now, it works only with Google’s Pixel phone . The many flavors of virtual reality While sophisticated systems like Facebook’s Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive let you walk around in the virtual world, Daydream View is a sit-down experience in which you use the controller to move yourself around. (You could walk around with the Daydream on if you wanted to, but you won’t go anywhere in virtual space — and you might run into the wall.) But the Rift and the Vive each costs more than $1,500, once you include powerful personal computers they require. Suddenly, $79 sounds like a bargain. Daydream stays cheap by using the display and processing power of your phone, which you insert into the headset at eye level. Gear VR, at $100, takes a similar approach, but it works only with Samsung phones. While Daydream works only with Pixel for now, several other Android makers plan to make compatible phones. Sorry, iPhone users. Those without compatible phones still have Google Cardboard, a $15 contraption you hold up to your face. Using Daydream View, by contrast, is more like wearing goggles. While Gear VR has a better fit, with focusing and a second strap over your head to keep the headset from sliding too low, Daydream is much more comfortable to wear and use than Cardboard. The controller Those who’ve played Nintendo’s Wii system will find the Daydream controller familiar. It’s about the size and shape of a chocolate bar, and it has motion sensors to track movement. Although I’m not a big gamer, I enjoyed shooting water out of a hose to put out fires. You simply hold a button to spray and move the controller around to douse flames. You even can tilt the controller to control the angle of the hose. Another app lets you explore the universe by using the controller as a laser pointer to bring up more information. The controller makes it easier to navigate menus without making yourself dizzy; just move it around to point at things. And while getting the full 360-degree experience of VR often requires spinning around (a swivel chair helps), some apps in Daydream let you grab the scene with your controller and drag it around you, just as you would with a PC mouse. It’s also handy to have volume controls and a home button in your hand rather than on your head. Nausea? VR can be nauseating, and Daydream is no different. I found that it’s less about the headset, and more about the VR video. The best videos use stationary cameras and let you move your head (or controller) around to explore. The nauseating ones tend to treat VR cameras like regular movie cameras, with a lot of panning in response to a subject’s movements. The viewer, not the subject, should be the one doing the moving. And while I enjoyed watching a woman’s skydive in VR on YouTube, scenes of her preparing to jump felt jarring because the camera was on her shaky arm. I had to remove my headset. What’s there to do? You can view 360-degree YouTube videos and any 360-degree photos you store on Google Photos. You can visit other destinations such as the Galapagos Islands in a 360-degree version of Google’s Street View. A few games, museum artworks and The Wall Street Journal’s app also were available to try out prior to the launch. Even more are promised by the end of the year, including apps for Netflix and Hulu — though all that does is offer video on a giant screen in a virtual living room. There’s much more available for Cardboard. Unfortunately, app developers will need to make some tweaks first to make them compatible with Daydream. They’ll need to do even more to take advantage of the motion control. Daydream has promise, but until more apps arrive, its potential is still a dream.

Sure, there are less expensive options like Google’s $15 Cardboard, but its apps aren’t exciting and it’s, well, made of cardboard. Samsung’s $100 Gear VR offers hundreds of apps with some excellent standouts, but you need a Samsung smartphone just to use it. Enter Google’s Daydream View. Available for $80, the Daydream View is a VR headset designed for use with any Android phone that runs Google’s Android-powered Daydream app. For now, that includes just one phone: Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel. But the company says additional Daydream-ready phones from HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung and others are on the horizon. So should you go get into a Daydream View? If you’ve got the Pixel and want to experience relatively inexpensive VR, then yes, the Daydream is worth the price of admission. Just don’t expect too many apps just yet. Comfort for your face If there’s one thing most VR headsets have in common, it’s that they’re heavy and unwieldy. In other words, they’re uncomfortable. Sony’s PlayStation VR is relatively cozy thanks to its uniquely adjustable design that lets you move the headset’s strap and lenses to better fit your face. Still, you’re always aware that you’ve got it strapped to your face, because of its weight. Daydream View, on the other hand, is genuinely comfortable thanks to its lightweight design. It’s almost like a pillow for your face. At about 8 ounces (without your smartphone), the Daydream View is lighter than the 12-ounce Gear VR. The Daydream View owes that weight savings to its cloth body. In fact, Google says it used the same type of cloth usually meant for athletic jerseys to make the headset light and breathable enough to wear for extended periods. I wore the Daydream View for a solid hour and didn’t notice any of the typical fogging I’ve experienced with other headsets. Google’s Daydream View is is one comfortable headset.More Of course, no matter how breathable the Daydream View is, you’re eventually going to sweat while wearing it. With other VR headsets, that means having to break out a Clorox wipe and some paper towels. But Google made the Daydream View’s gasket, the part that touches your face, removable and washable. So if you, or your perpetually sweaty friend Dave, end up sweating all over the thing, you can just toss it into the washing machine and it’ll come out nice and clean again. Setting up your Daydream Setting up the Daydream View is incredibly easy. First you download and set up the Daydream VR app on your smartphone. Next, launch the app, unhook the loop keeping the headset’s front panel closed and place your phone on it. Your handset should automatically connect to the Daydream View and tell you to close the latch. And that’s it. Once you’ve got your Daydream View on, you’ll get a quick tutorial explaining how to use the included remote. Yep, the Daydream View comes with its own remote control, and boy is it convenient. What’s more, Google included a small section for you to place the remote into the Daydream View’s headset so you don’t lose it. The remote features a large circular touchpad at its top, as well as back, home and volume buttons. Inside are a series of sensors that allow you to physically point at and select in-app items and navigate via motion controls. Enter the Daydream When you strap on the Daydream View, you’re greeted by a stylized cartoon forest complete with running streams and chirping birds. The home screen is made up of three main app boxes that you can point to using the remote (a white laser pointer guides you) and swipe through using the touchpad. Read More Google’s Daydream View in person.More Below that are icons for your five most recently used apps. Under those are links to Google’s Play Store, your Daydream apps library and the headset’s settings menu. So far there are 16 apps available for the Daydream, five from Google and the rest from various other developers. Google’s apps are easily the best of the bunch. Google Street View lets you take virtual tours of locations ranging from New York’s Times Square and Central Park to the Taj Mahal and Coliseum. You can’t actually walk around in the app; instead, you use Daydream’s remote to point and click at specific white dots that let you navigate to different areas. YouTube lets you watch 360-degree videos, which are pretty impressive, until you come across a standard video. In that case, you have to watch it while standing in a fake movie theater. Sure it makes the image look like it’s on a big-screen, but I can also do that on my TV without wearing a mask. Google Play Movies projects movies on a faux makeshift backyard screen that’ll make you feel right at home, while Google Photos lets you view your 360 panoramas by turning your head. Meanwhile, Google Arts and Culture lets you get close enough to famous paintings like Vincent van Gogh’s “Starry Night” to see individual brush strokes. The Daydream View works with any Daydream-enabled smartphone.More Additional apps include games Hunters gate, Mekorama and Wonderglade, as well as Star Chart VR and Wall Street Journal VR. None of the games will suck you in, though, as they’re mostly meant to be proofs of concept than anything else. Wall Street Journal VR is interesting, as it lets you check the day’s news, read articles and watch videos. But again, you can do all of that on your phone or laptop without having to strap a headset on. While available 360 video are certainly worth checking out, there still aren’t many of them. But it’s the Daydream’s remote that brings the whole package together. Samsung’s Gear VR is a wonderful device, but you have to either use its touchpad, which is located on the headset itself, or buy a secondary controller. The fact that the Daydream’s remote is part of the package and includes motion controls is absolutely clutch. Google’s Daydream View has a removable and washable gasket.More I did, however, notice the remote would occasionally go off course when I was pointing at something with the headset on. I quickly corrected it by re-centering the screen. Should you get it? Google’s Daydream View is a fantastic headset that’s incredibly comfortable and exceptionally inexpensive. The included remote is a great deal and the fact that the system is so easy to set up and use will attract new users. There are some downsides, though. First off, the apps library isn’t very large yet. With just 16 apps available on launch day, there’s just not enough content to hold your attention for very long. Google says it will have 41 apps by the end of the year, but that’s still well below the huge number of apps offered through Samsung’s Gear VR. What’s more, the Gear VR’s apps are a lot more fleshed out and engrossing. Then there’s how hot your phone gets when used with the Daydream View. You never feel heat on your face, but it’s a bit unsettling, for sure. The Daydream View will definitely be worth your cash when its apps library is larger and it works with more smartphones, especially since it’s just $80. But for now, you might want to hold off.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Apple Refurbished iPhones Again Being Offered in the Apple Store Google Pulling the Plug on Free Map Maker Tool SAP Releases Revamped HANA Database Nov. 30 AMD Targets Gaming, VR with New Radeon GPUs       Today's topics include the return of refurbished iPhones return to the Apple store, Google's decision to retire community edits on its Maps application, SAP's report that it will soon release HANA 2, a revamped version of its in-memory database and AMD's plan to target content creators with new Radeon graphics cards. After an extended absence, Apple is again offering refurbished iPhone models at discounted prices through the online Apple Store o buyers who want a refurbished device that comes with a standard one-year Apple warranty. The refurbished iPhones began showing up recently on the Apple website, with discounts ranging from about $80 to $110, or about 15 percent below retail prices. The last time Apple sold refurbished iPhones appears to be in 2007. Google has decided to pull the plug on its free Map Maker tool that people have used for more than eight years to make community edits to Google Maps. The company will formally retire Map Maker as a stand-alone product in March 2017 and integrate its features directly into Maps. Doing so will allow Google to focus on enabling the best editing and moderation capabilities right within the desktop and mobile versions of Maps, the company announced. Google will continue to roll out new features and update existing ones so the user community can continue to contribute to Maps. But there will no longer be a separate stand-alone tool for doing it. Back in December 2010, SAP re-invigorated its entire business with the introduction of the HANA (high-performance analytic appliance) in-memory database. Since then, it has grown into an almost-$2 billion business for the German software company, and prospects continue to look good for sales going into 2017. At its SAP TechEd Conference Nov. 8 in Barcelona, the company announced that it soon will release a new version of the speedy database, SAP HANA 2, which includes new features and enhancements involving database management, data management, analytical intelligence and application development. Advanced Micro Devices is targeting content creators in such areas as gaming and virtual reality with the latest high-end graphics cards for workstations and similar systems. AMD officials this week announced that the Radeon Pro WX Series of professional graphics cards, which are based on the company's 14-nanometer Polaris architecture, are available. They will address the demands rising from such trends as real-time gaming engines, virtual reality (VR), low-overhead APIs—such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan—and open-source tools and applications. GPUs are a key part of AMD's larger effort to grow its fortunes, allowing the chip maker to compete with Nvidia in a range of growth areas, including gaming, immersive computing and VR.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Why did ProtonMail vanish from Google search results for months? Posted Oct 27, 2016 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Here’s the full schedule of NBA games that will be shown in VR this season If you’re the maker of a popular, zero access encrypted webmail product and suddenly discover your product is no longer featuring in Google search results for queries such as “secure email” and “encrypted email,” what do you conclude? That something is amiss, for sure. But the rather more pertinent question is whether your product’s disappearance is accidental or intentional — given that Google also offers a popular webmail product, Gmail, albeit one that does not offer zero access because users “pay” the company with their personal data, which feeds into Alphabet’s user profiling and ad targeting engines. So, in other words, Google is not an entirely disinterested bystander when it comes to a rival email product’s success. It is also especially pertinent to consider intention here, given that Google is under antitrust investigation in the European Union (and elsewhere), with the EC’s competition commissioner probing long-running complaints that the company actively demotes rival services in its own search results — impeding their ability to compete. In Europe, Google’s search engine has a massively dominant share of the market — of circa 90 percent. Which means that vanishing from Google search results in Europe puts an especially large handicap on any business’ ability to compete in the region. Où est ProtonMail? The encrypted email product in question is ProtonMail, a Swiss startup that began in 2014 by crowdfunding an alternative to U.S. encrypted email providers that had been folding under pressure to submit user data to intelligence agencies. In 2015, ProtonMail had passed half a million users. Earlier this year it exited beta, and added iOS and Android apps. It now has around two million users, according to founder Andy Yen. Back in March he told TechCrunch that ProtonMail was approaching break even — through donations and paid accounts. However, in a blog post published yesterday, the company claims Google nearly killed its product and seriously dented its profitability by disappearing “ProtonMail” from relevant search results. In November 2015, Yen writes that the company noticed it was no longer appearing in Google search results for related search queries — despite roughly doubling its user base by that fall — whereas all other major search engines were still returning ProtonMail prominently in their results: ProtonMail tracked this situation through Spring 2016, trying to get in touch with Google to query why it had vanished from search results — and initially having no luck getting a response. It only eventually got an acknowledgment of the complaint in August after it had tweeted at Google staff. After that public exchange, ProtonMail was apparently informed within a few days that Google had “fixed something” — and after that it was able to see immediately positive results: A quick test confirms that a search for “secure email” or “encrypted email” in Google now returns ProtonMail as the top or second result. However, ProtonMail says no details have been forthcoming from Google as to what kind of “problem” had demoted or disappeared ProtonMail’s product from related searches via the Google search engine. We’ve also asked the company for an explanation — but at the time of writing it has not responded to our questions. “Without any additional explanation from Google, we may never know why ProtonMail become unranked. In any case, we do appreciate Google finally taking action to resolve the issue, we just wished it happened sooner,” writes Yen. “[E]ven though Google is an American company, it controls over 90% of European search traffic. In this case, Google directly caused ProtonMail’s growth rate worldwide to be reduced by over 25% for over 10 months,” he adds. “This meant that ProtonMail’s income from users was also cut by 25%, putting financial pressure on our operations. We went from being able to cover all our monthly expenses to having to draw from our emergency reserve fund. The lost income and financial damage incurred as a result was several hundred thousand Swiss Francs (1 CHF = 1.01 USD), which will never be reimbursed.” Discussing the matter further with TechCrunch, Yen describes Google as “notoriously tight-lipped when it comes to search issues. The only information they disclosed was that they were able to find and fix something based off of our data. It’s not really a satisfactory answer considering the problem cost us several hundred thousand Swiss francs and imperiled the business.” In his blog post Yen uses the phrase “Search Risk” to characterize the problem — arguing that “more transparency and oversight” of Google’s dominant regional position in search is essential to avoid the risk of other startups being snuffled out by being bumped off Google’s index. ProtonMail is now supportive of the EC antitrust case against Google. “The only reason we survived to tell this story is because the majority of ProtonMail’s growth comes from word of mouth, and our community is too loud to be ignored. Many other companies won’t be so fortunate,” he writes. “This episode illustrates that Search Risk is serious, which is why we now agree with the European Commission that given Google’s dominant position in search, more transparency and oversight is critical.” Quite frankly, it is insane to not have any regulation or transparency for search. Does Yen think ProtonMail was intentionally disappeared from search results by Google? “It is very hard to speculate on the inner workings at Google and whether this was intentional or not,” he responds. “It could have also been a Google software bug, but we have not heard of any other cases like this so it’s strange for a bug to only impact us. Intentional or not, it is a pretty clear demonstration of a real world impact that Google’s search monopoly can have.” Since going public with the search discoverability problem, Yen says ProtonMail has been invited by Yelp — one of the coalition of Google antitrust complainants — to request interested third-party status in the ongoing antitrust case against Google. “We will weigh this option over the next couple days before making a decision. There has always been speculation about Google search results, but our case seems to be the only one out there (that we could find anyways) that is backed by data,” he adds. “It’s a troubling case, and I think it validates the antitrust investigations the European Commission has opened up against Google. With Google’s search monopoly, you have a situation where a single company could arbitrarily destroy any other businesses it wants, without well defined legal constraints. “This is unprecedented in history, as all other industries with this level of control and influence, such as banking, have long been regulated industries. Quite frankly, it is insane to not have any regulation or transparency for search.” Trying to fight Google for compensation for lost revenue based on the search issue would require breaking new ground legally to pursue it, and resources ProtonMail does not have, he adds. Evidently the answer, in his view, is regulation. Without visibility of the inner workings of Google’s search ranking algorithms it is clearly impossible for outsiders to verify whether the company is fairly ranking rivals or not. And while there have been a few moves by politicians in France and Germany to apply pressure on Google to open its black-box algorithms to regulatory audit, it would take a concerted and coordinated Europe-wide effort to create legislation to require disclose — and despite increasingly noisy complaints from disgruntled rivals with stories of being squeezed out of search results, we’re not there yet. You would also expect Google to fight tooth and nail to keep its proprietary secret sauce under wraps. So there would be a huge lobbying effort mobilized to shut down any such regulatory efforts. But with worrying examples like the ProtonMail case continuing to count against it, and reports suggesting the EC is preparing to fine Google on antitrust grounds, the company is not doing itself any favors in a region where its business processes remain under heavy suspicion. The optics look awful. And pressure for regulators to be able to audit the decisions its search algorithm makes may well step up in the future. As security commentator Graham Cluley puts: “Google really should have responded much more quickly when the [ProtonMail] issue was first brought to their attention. Failing to fix the problem earlier will only make more people believe that it was intentional.” Yet intentional or otherwise, damage was clearly done — and that may be the most powerful argument for the need to audit increasingly powerful algorithms.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search How I use Google Daydream without a View headset (with Cardboard) Chris Burns - Nov 11, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Pixel users are now able to work and play with Google Daydream without the official Google Daydream View headset. While Google would rather that Daydream VR users use their first Daydream View headset, for sale in their store, there’s another way to do it. Google has graciously allowed the Google Daydream environment to be fiddled with by anyone in an effort to draw developers for massive app and game creation. The Google Daydream VR environment is made for the next generation of Google-approved Android smartphones. Daydream is said to require a certain set of hardware and software bits and pieces, as outlined in our big Google Daydream View Review. In reality, though, quite a few smartphones without these specs can participate in this VR environment. Above you’ll see our early demo of the Daydream Controller back when we needed to keep it connected between phones with USB. The newest version of this app – for developers – only requires a Bluetooth connection. This is just like the real controller device which connects to Pixel phones with Bluetooth as well. A couple of requirements do seem to be absolutely required by the Daydream app. These include running Android 7.0 Nougat on our prospective Daydream smartphone. Requirements for a secondary phone – to be used as a controller – are that a gyroscope and Android 4.4+ be present. First, I needed two smartphones, one to run the Daydream app, the other to act as a controller. The Daydream app requires that a controller be present – otherwise it shows an overlay box searching for said controller. While some apps may (eventually) not require the controller, the vast majority seem to so far. The Daydream smartphone will need to be running the Daydream App (here on APK mirror) and the Daydream Keyboard app (also on APK mirror). A third app will be required, this one headed for the controller phone. This third app is the Google Daydream Controller Emulator app we showed working on a Samsung Galaxy S7 back in May. Courtesy of Google’s own Developers portal, the Daydream Controller APK can be downloaded from Github. Once these three apps have been installed, follow the instructions that follow this sentence. 1. Pair the two smartphones via Bluetooth. 2. Open the Daydream app. 3. Tap the menu button (upper right, three horizontal white lines). 4. Tap Settings. 5. Tap “Build Version” 8 times – Developer Options should appear. 6. Tap Developer Options. 7. Tap Controller Emulator Device. 8. Select your other phone from the list and press OK. 9. Tap “Skip VR entry screens” and press OK. 10. Tap back, back until you get to the first Daydream home screen. 11. Tap the blue button with the viewer icon. 12. Open the Daydream Controller app on the controller phone. 13. Place the Daydream phone into a Google Cardboard viewer of some sort – or don’t, if you want to view without VR, for whatever reason. The Daydream phone should show VR in a fashion not all that unlike what Cardboard has done for the past couple of years. The secondary control phone should act the same way as the standard Daydream Controller does with the official Google Daydream View headset. Users MAY get a headache after a while, the same as they would with any other VR headset setup. I don’t have a Google Pixel! It does not currently matter (for the most part) if the Google Daydream app is used outside of a Daydream-approved smartphone. We’ve tried a couple of Nexus devices to see if they work with the Google Daydream app and they do. They might not be working nearly as well as a Pixel or Pixel XL, but they work. They’re also not covered by any claims Google might make to avoid headaches – but they work. I’ve lost my Daydream View controller, now what? This solution is potentially helpful for people that do not have the Google Daydream controller. While we’d originally set out to show now non-crucial the Daydream View was to the equation, we found that the controller wasn’t either. You’re still going to get the best experience with all the Google-approved pieces of hardware, but you don’t NEED them to use Daydream. We’re crossing our fingers that Google allows the Daydream Controller to be sold without the headset in the future. The controller does live safely in the headset, all snug and nice, but there’s still a chance it’ll be lost. There’s always a chance of something like that happening. And again, if I really want the full Daydream experience, I’m going to need a Pixel or Pixel XL as well as the real-deal Daydream View. The Daydream View costs around $80 and includes the controller, and the controller has a rechargeable battery via USB-C. Cords that come in the box with the Pixel and/or Pixel XL also work with the Daydream Controller. Have a peek at the timeline below for more information on this VR environment.

The EC this spring charged that Google's requirements to use its search engine and its Chrome browser on mobile devices running Android were coercive tactics. The EC also charged that Google prevented manufacturers from offering smart devices using rival operating systems based on the Android open source code. Google has not harmed competition through the way it offers the Android operating system, argued Kent Walker, general counsel for the company. On the contrary, Google has expanded competition, he said. Folly of Fragmentation "First, the commission's case is based on the idea that Android doesn't compete with Apple's iOS," Walker noted. "We don't see it that way." Eighty-nine percent of respondents to the EC's own market survey considered Android and Apple as competitors, he pointed out. The EC's charges ignore the dangers of fragmentation in a mobile ecosystem, Walker said, noting further that the 1.3 million developers active as of 2015 needed a stable and consistent framework to operate in. Although developers can download and modify Android as they please, the fragmentation that creates has led to problems for operating systems like Unix and Symbian, he observed. "When anybody can modify your code, how do you ensure there's a common, consistent version of the operating system, so that developers don't have to go through the hassle and expense of building multiple versions of their apps?" Walker asked. Apple and Microsoft offer less choice of apps on their phones, he maintained. Android usually accounts for only one-third of preloaded apps, he said. Consumers can download apps they want to use, and the average user downloads an additional 50 apps over the lifetime of a device. Consumers downloaded 65 billion apps from Google Play in 2015, an average of 175 million a day. However, there are deep divisions within the tech industry and the open source community about the impact Android has left on competition. Critics Abound Android actually is a closed system, and any claim to the contrary is disingenuous, said Thomas Vinje, counsel to digital rights group Fair Search. "Google imposes severe sanctions on those who defy its insistence on conformity," he pointed out. Phone makers that offer even a few phones that fail to comply with Google's "straightjacket" are cut off from all Google-branded products, according to Vinje. The EU seems be taking a fairly aggressive stance toward Google on other issues as well, noted Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Google has the facts on its side, he acknowledged, but it's questionable how much that will matter in the end. "It's hard to envision a scenario in which the company emerges completely unscathed," Castro told the E-Commerce Times. One of the reasons apps have been concentrated on Google devices is that consumers want what they need in one place, argued Karol Severin, an analyst at Midia Research. "No matter how many searches or OSes are out there, the best ones are bound to rise to the top and start acting like chip leaders if they can," he told the E-Commerce Times. The Google argument that Android competes with Apple's iOS is almost the same argument that Microsoft gave when it argued that it competed against the Mac OS in a separate case involving Windows, recalled Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "Ironically, then Google was one of the firms pushing for the adverse Microsoft judgment, while Apple actually defended Microsoft," he told the E-Commerce Times. The EC was in receipt of Google's response, spokesperson Ricardo Cardoso confirmed to the E-Commerce Times, and in keeping with its standard practice, it would give careful consideration to the company's arguments before deciding how to move forward.

 Facebook is being blamed for Trump's election — but Mark Zuckerberg's response is tone deaf Alyson Shontell Nov. 11, 2016, 4:32 PM 141,534 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Getty / Stephen Lam Half the nation is blaming Facebook for Donald Trump's election. And Facebook feels that's very unfair! The argument is that Facebook now plays a huge role in the distribution of information. Its 2 billion active users may read traditional news sources like The New York Times and Business Insider. But they aren't typically visiting those websites directly. Instead, they're scrolling through Facebook's news feed and reading articles that friends share. The problem is that Facebook users aren't always good at distinguishing legitimate news sources from satire, propaganda, or just plain false information. And if bad information goes viral, it can negatively influence the public's opinion. The spreading of false information during the election cycle was so bad that President Barack Obama called Facebook a "dust cloud of nonsense." "People if they just repeat attacks enough and outright lies over and over again, as long as it's on Facebook and people can see it, as long as its on social media, people start believing it," he said. But Mark Zuckerberg doesn't seem to get that. "Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook — it's a very small amount of the content — influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea," Zuckerberg said on Thursday night. That seems a bit tone deaf. If Facebook wants to be a platform where billions of people regularly find and share news, then it needs to accept some of the responsibility that comes with that power. That means coming up with some guidelines to help spread information responsibly. A messy business It's not hard to see why Facebook is reluctant to do this. The internet was built on the legal foundation that online companies are not liable for third-party content displayed on their sites. Acting as an information gatekeeper and making editorial decisions is a difficult and messy business. Facebook learned this earlier this year when a person who worked on the project told Gizmodo that contractors Facebook employed suppressed politically conservative articles from the trending news section. Facebook's response to the controversy was to fire the contractors and let its algorithm decide which stories appear in the trending news box. Clearly, more work needs to be done. But there's good news: Facebook doesn't need to reinvent the wheel. Google has already spent two decades battling the distribution of bad content online. Facebook can adopt this by: Assessing the quality of the content being shared (and the authority of the people who are sharing it) Burying content that doesn't meet quality standards Google has built an algorithm that prioritizes the quality and relevance of an article. Anyone can write anything online, but not just any piece of content will show up in the first few pages of a Google search result. It's not perfect — just ask former Sen. Rick Santorum, who was the victim of the most famous Google bomb, in which a webpage characterizing him in vulgar terms rose to the top of search results. But Google takes its responsibility to surface the right information seriously — in part because its business depends on it — and by and large, people trust that the top results on Google will be legitimate. The vetting game Google also examines the source of the article carefully. It has an application process for publishers that want to be part of its Google News or AMP — accelerated mobile pages — programs. Then it has a team carefully review each applicant and reject a site if it doesn't meet quality standards. Sites are evaluated on a number of things, including their "authority" on a subject matter, their "journalistic standards," their ability to show "accountability" for content through proper attribution and author bio pages, and more. If a site is rejected, it can reapply a few months later. Facebook's Instant Articles, by contrast, don't seem to require much vetting at all. Instant Articles launched in closed beta, with a few Facebook-approved partners. But now it appears open to almost any site that has the required tech specifications. The only requirement listed on the Instant Articles FAQ page for publishers is that the content does not run afoul of Facebook's community standards, which bans things like sexually explicit content and violent threats. Now that Facebook is such an important part of the news cycle, its vetting process needs to mature. It should evaluate the person who is sharing a piece of content on Facebook, weigh the quality of the link being shared, and then determine how far a friend's status message should really spread. Coming up with this sort of process isn't censorship. It's just being responsible. This is an editorial. The opinions and conclusions expressed above are those of the author.

It’s just the beginning, yes, but it’s still a bummer that Home is launching without some functionality that Amazon has been spending the last couple years building into Alexa. And that’s not going to be fixed over night. But a lot of people seem to have somehow missed that Google Assistant works with IFTTT, a service that indirectly ties your Google Home — or your Pixel, for that matter — up to a plethora of services that Google doesn’t support directly. Follow along as we walk through some easy steps that can add a lot of Assistant functionality you might not have considered possible yet… IFTTT, a service that’s name stands for “if this then that,” offers what it calls “applets,” little connections that let your web services connect to each other and trigger each other to do things. Google Assistant is one of those services — all you have to do is pair up your Google account — and IFTTT lets you use the new voice helper from Google to control lots of other services that it can’t control normally. A great example of some of things you can use IFTTT to do can be found at the Google Assistant page, which suggests lots of useful pre-made “applets”. That’s not where the possibilities end, though, because IFTTT supports dozens of services and platforms that you don’t see here. Let’s walk through the steps you need to take to unlock more potential in Google Assistant. Set up your IFTTT account The first thing you need is an IFTTT account, which you can get over at IFTTT’s website. It’s free of course, and it should only take a minute to make — IFTTT is good about not asking for too much information. From there, head over to the My Applets page, where you’ll find the applets you’ve made. If you’re new, you shouldn’t have any applets yet. Let’s change that. Use a pre-made applet The easiest way to get started is to head to the page I mentioned earlier, which offers some pre-made applets that tie-in with your favorite services. There’s one that lets you use Assistant to post to Facebook, post to Twitter, change your Hue lights, add a task to Todoist, and more. To set these up, simply head over to the Assistant IFTTT page, and pick the one you want. You’ll land on a page like this that asks you to “turn on” the applet. This will ask you to sign into your account for whichever service you chose (and your Google account too, of course), and then you can configure the applet however you want. You can customize the actual command that you’re going to use with Google Assistant (you can even add more than one), and you can choose how Assistant will respond. After you’ve clicked save on your applet, you should find it on your My Applets page and it should be active and ready to use on your Google Home or your Google Pixel (or other device with Assistant). It’s really that simple to add more functionality to your Assistant. Create an applet Alternatively, you can just create your own applet. This is a little bit more complicated, so I would recommend you only go for this route if you’ve been using IFTTT for a while or you otherwise know what you’re doing. After you’ve clicked “New Applet” from the My Applets page, you can chose the “this” and the “that.” The “this” should be Google Assistant, and the “that” can be any of the compatible services you want. This part can be a little tricky, because the “this” part (Google Assistant) has a few options you can go with. You can have it be a simple phrase, a phrase with a number, a phrase with a text command, or a phrase with both text and a number. These text and number values that you choose — if you use them — will then be used in the second part of the recipe to manipulate what the “that” service does. This applet can literally be anything you want. If you want your Google Home to send you a text message when you say “OK, Google, send me a text message (some message),” you can do that. If you want to have Google Assistant search for a song you specify and add it to your Spotify saved list, you can do that. Really, the possibilities are almost infinite. Conclusion Even if you just stick with the pre-made applets, this is a lot of functionality for Assistant that you might now have realized was there. Set the colors of your LIFX lights, post tweets, add contacts to your Google Contacts (which, inexplicably, isn’t possible outright with Assistant out of the box), and more with this simple trick. And all it takes is a few minutes to sign into a couple accounts.

Back To Top[*] The highlight of Google's Daydream VR is ... its controller Nov. 12, 2016 - 05:55AM JST The best thing about Google’s new virtual-reality headset isn’t the headset at all. In fact, Daydream View would pale compared with Samsung’s Gear VR headset were it not for Daydream’s controller, a handheld device that responds to gestures and other motion. With Gear VR, I have to move my head to point a cursor at something, then reach for a button on the headset. With Daydream, I can just aim and click the controller in my hand. Sensors in the device tell the headset what I’m trying to do, whether it’s swinging a tennis racket or casting a fishing rod. The headset’s display responds accordingly. The headset and controller are sold together for $79. No rush in getting one, though, as the virtual experiences built for Daydream are still limited. And for now, it works only with Google’s Pixel phone . ___ THE MANY FLAVORS OF VIRTUAL REALITY While sophisticated systems like Facebook’s Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive let you walk around in the virtual world, Daydream View is a sit-down experience in which you use the controller to move yourself around. (You could walk around with the Daydream on if you wanted to, but you won’t go anywhere in virtual space — and you might run into the wall.) But the Rift and the Vive each costs more than $1,500, once you include powerful personal computers they require. Suddenly, $79 sounds like a bargain. Daydream stays cheap by using the display and processing power of your phone, which you insert into the headset at eye level. Gear VR, at $100, takes a similar approach, but it works only with Samsung phones. While Daydream works only with Pixel for now, several other Android makers plan to make compatible phones. Sorry, iPhone users. Those without compatible phones still have Google Cardboard, a $15 contraption you hold up to your face. Using Daydream View, by contrast, is more like wearing goggles. While Gear VR has a better fit, with focusing and a second strap over your head to keep the headset from sliding too low, Daydream is much more comfortable to wear and use than Cardboard. ___ ALL ABOUT THAT CONTROLLER Those who’ve played Nintendo’s Wii system will find the Daydream controller familiar. It’s about the size and shape of a chocolate bar, and it has motion sensors to track movement. Although I’m not a big gamer, I enjoyed shooting water out of a hose to put out fires. You simply hold a button to spray and move the controller around to douse flames. You can even tilt the controller to control the angle of the hose. Another app lets you explore the universe by using the controller as a laser pointer to bring up more information. The controller makes it easier to navigate menus without making yourself dizzy; just move it around to point at things. And while getting the full 360-degree experience of VR often requires spinning around (a swivel chair helps), some apps in Daydream let you grab the scene with your controller and drag it around you, just as you would with a PC mouse. It’s also handy to have volume controls and a home button in your hand rather than on your head. ___ NAUSEA FREE? VR can be nauseating, and Daydream is no different. I found that it’s less about the headset, and more about the VR video. The best videos use stationary cameras and let you move your head (or controller) around to explore. The nauseating ones tend to treat VR cameras like regular movie cameras , with a lot of panning in response to a subject’s movements. The viewer, not the subject, should be the one doing the moving. And while I enjoyed watching a woman’s skydive in VR on YouTube, scenes of her preparing to jump felt jarring because the camera was on her shaky arm. I had to remove my headset. ___ WHAT’S THERE TO DO? You can view 360-degree YouTube videos and any 360-degree photos you store on Google Photos. You can visit other destinations such as the Galapagos Islands in a 360-degree version of Google’s Street View. A few games, museum artworks and The Wall Street Journal’s app were also available to try out prior to Thursday’s launch. A handful more are coming Thursday. Even more are promised by the end of the year, including apps for Netflix and Hulu — though all that does is offer video on a giant screen in a virtual living room. There’s much more available for Cardboard. Unfortunately, app developers will need to make some tweaks first to make them compatible with Daydream. They’ll need to do even more to take advantage of the motion control. Daydream has promise, but until more apps arrive, its potential is still a dream.

But while the search engine was a good jumping-off point, travelers would usually quickly turn to tools like Hopper’s airfare predictions or Kayak’s Explore filters to take advantage of the deal-hunting features Google lacked. However, Google recently updated their flight and hotel search tools to make them even more robust. Here are four improvements to take advantage of. 1. THE GOOGLE TRIPS APP In September, Google released Google Trips, a full service travel app that helps you plan and manage upcoming journeys. Once you download the app and connect it to your Gmail account, it scans your email for all relevant travel information—from your flight information to your hotel confirmation to your car reservation—to consolidate and store it in one place. You can also download this info so you can access it offline, which is useful if you’re en route and Wi-Fi is spotty or nonexistent. You can also use it to create your own personal itinerary based on those recommendations you got from friends and pages you bookmarked in your travel guides. (Or, if you're in a time crunch, you can choose from one of the itineraries Google Trips proposes for you.) It also gives you relevant and important logistical information about your destination, like public transportation and tipping etiquette. 2. BETTER FLIGHT PRICE TRACKING Price tracking is nothing new in Google Flights—if you want to monitor prices, just toggle the “track prices” button when you search for a specific flight. You can also elect to get email alerts when prices increase or decrease. Even better, though, Google will now tell you if the prices for that flight are likely to increase. If they are, a pop-up window will tell you how much more you can expect to pay if you book later. Google Flights has also enhanced its "date tip" feature (which tells you how much you can save if you fly from a different airport or on a different day). Now, Google will also tell you if the specific route you’re researching has experienced any price jumps historically. 3. MORE FILTERS WHEN EXPLORING DESTINATIONS Google’s Explore feature (which you access from the flight search page by clicking the sandwich menu next to "Flights" in the window's upper left corner) is also more robust now. Previously, you’ve been able to use its interactive map to explore prices to destinations around the world based on when you want to travel, which is useful if you're looking for an inexpensive getaway during a set period (like Spring Break). With its recent updates, you can now also filter and sort flights by number of stops, price, and airline. Its “Interests” filter lets you look for specific types of destinations: beaches, honeymoon spots, wildlife, and more. 4. INSIGHT ON HOTEL DISCOUNTS Google’s hotel search has received an upgrade, too. When you search for hotels in a specific city, Google will now tell you what prices have looked like historically, depending on the hotel and your travel dates. This way, you can see if the current rate is standard or if it’s likely to drop in the near future. Like the “tips” feature in Google flights, the hotel search will also show you how much you can save if you book on a different day. Google also highlights (with a lightbulb icon) whether the hotel you're considering is running any special deals or is top-rated in the area.

The complete guide to virtual reality – everything you need to get started The Guardian 4 days ago Stuart Dredge © Getty Images Google’s Daydream View is fabric, not plastic (or cardboard). Until recently, virtual reality had been something of a fantasy for storytellers and technologists. As long ago as 1935, American science fiction writer Stanley G Weinbaum described something like virtual reality in a short story called Pygmalion’s Spectacles. “But listen – a movie that gives one sight and sound. Suppose now I add taste, smell, even touch, if your interest is taken by the story. Suppose I make it so that you are in the story, you speak to the shadows, and the shadows reply, and instead of being on a screen, the story is all about you, and you are in it. Would that be to make real a dream?” Technologists might still be working on smell and taste, but Albert Ludwig’s “magic spectacles” eerily foreshadow the current prominence for headsets and 360-degree games, videos and virtual worlds. Since Ludwig’s magic spectacles found their way into print, there have been decades of experimentation around virtual reality, from the first head-mounted VR system in the late 1960s to the first commercial products in the 1980s – not to mention Hollywood’s interpretation in the1992 film The Lawnmower Man, which shaped mainstream perceptions of virtual reality, or VR, for some time afterwards. The current age of virtual reality began in 2010, when American teenager Palmer Luckey created the first prototype of a VR headset that would evolve into the Oculus Rift. Two years later, he launched a $250,000 Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to commercialise it – and $2.4m of pledges later, the tech industry’s interest in VR was reborn. Two years after that, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg liked the Rift so much he bought the company for $2bn. Several competitors have emerged since then, from the HTC Vive and Sony’s PlayStation VR to smartphone-powered headsets such as Samsung’s Gear VR and Google Cardboard. Meanwhile, hundreds of developers are making VR games and apps, film-makers are exploring the potential for documentaries and animation, and Facebook and YouTube have jumped on the bandwagon with 360-degree videos. But if you’re new to virtual reality, where should you start? In the absence of a passing professor with magic specs, here’s everything you need to know about hardware, apps and games. The basics The most important piece of a virtual reality kit is the headset, a device like a thick pair of goggles that goes over your eyes. The more expensive, higher quality headsets need to be connected to a computer to run apps and games, while some cheaper ones use a cellphone clipped to the front of the headset. All headsets need to be used alongside a good quality pair of headphones, and there are other optional accessories from hand controllers to treadmills that are all designed to enhance your simulated experience of being in another world. Hand controllers translate your real-world gestures into whatever game or application you’re using, although standard gaming joypads can also be used. VR devices have their own app stores, similar to smartphone app stores, where you can browse and download games and apps. Some of these stores are accessed using the device itself, while others – the VR section of the Steam digital games store, for example – can be browsed on your computer.  © Bloomberg An attendee plays a game on an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset during the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Tuesday, June 16, 2015. High-end headsets Oculus Rift Four years after its first crowdfunding campaign, the first commercial version of Oculus Rift launched in early 2016, sold initially from the Oculus VR website and gradually made its way to retailers around the world. Until now, you needed a powerful PC to use the Oculus Rift. The minimum specs for an Oculus Ready PC are on the official website, with Dell, HP, Alienware and Asus all offering VR-ready machines. Oculus VR has also launched bundles of Rift with a PC, such as the $2,050 Alienware bundle. That said, Oculus has just announced that thanks to some technology it has dubbed “asynchronous spacewarp”, the Rift will now work with PCs costing as little as $500. Oculus is expanding its hardware offering, and in December Oculus will launch a dedicated Oculus Touch controller, which translates your hand gestures into the virtual environment. At $199, it’s not cheap. Price: $599 (£549) includes the headset with built-in headphones and mic, movement sensor, remote and Xbox One controller. You’ll also need: a powerful PC – check the recommended specs. Best for: early adopters, and anyone keen for a first-hand view of how Facebook will make virtual reality more social. Verdict: Oculus Rift kickstarted the newest generation of VR and has an inventive community of developers making games and apps for it – even if a few have ditched it in protest over its founder’s political activities. Facebook’s financial backing should ensure the Rift is in it for the long haul, too. 10 Oculus Rift apps and games to try - Chronos: wonderful-looking role-playing game with plenty of depth - Minecraft VR: the blocky building game suits VR well - Elite: Dangerous: epic space game gets even more epic with a headset - Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes: clever multiplayer game – the headset wearer defuses a bomb while friends try to help - EVE: Valkyrie: this space dogfighter was made for VR, and it shows - The Climb: part game and part experience, this sees you climbing mountains around the world - Jaunt VR: a range of great made-for-VR videos, from documentaries to music - Henry: Oculus VR’s attempt at a Pixar-quality animated short film - Apollo 11 VR Experience: a clever historical app that sends you on the moon-landing mission - Within: a mix of bespoke fiction and nonfiction videos made for viewing in VR © Bloomberg An attendee tries the Vive virtual reality experience (VR) on the HTC Corp. stand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Tuesday, Feb. 23, 2016. HTC Vive The HTC Vive is a partnership between Taiwanese tech firm HTC and the games company Valve. Valve added a dedicated VR category to its existing Steam digital games store, while HTC has just launched its Viveport site for non-gaming apps. Vive is a direct rival to Oculus Rift, though several games and apps are available for both devices. Like the Rift, it requires a PC to run its software, and HTC helps buyers get the right kit by maintaining a list of Vive Ready computers, including partners Alienware, HP and MSI. The Vive has some unique features, including a front-facing camera which, in certain apps, can bring the real world into your virtual environments. You also get two hand-worn gestural controllers in the box, unlike the Rift, which partly explains the higher price. The Vive also comes with a base station that tracks your movements, so within fairly tight limits you can walk around inside your VR space. This means a longer setup process, comparable to setting up a high-end home-audio system properly rather than just bunging your stereo on a shelf – but as more apps and games use the option, it could prove to be the Vive’s killer feature. Price: $799 (£759) includes the headset, two wireless hand-controllers, two base stations and a link box to connect it to your computer. You’ll also need: a powerful PC – check the recommended specs. Best for: anyone who wants the absolute top-spec (for now) home VR system, with a mix of gaming and non-gaming. Verdict: HTC Vive is the most expensive system on the market, and also the one that takes most effort to set up. Yet once you’ve done that, the ability to walk around within your virtual space, as well as turn your head, is impressive. The involvement of Valve, with its Steam store, means there’s a big community of developers too. 10 HTC Vive apps and games to try - Job Simulator: a big word-of-mouth hit; its 2050 setting simulates jobs taken over by robots - Elite: Dangerous: epic space game gets even more epic with a headset - Cosmic Trip: gripping “first-person real-time strategy” game about colonising alien planets - The Brookhaven Experiment: survival-based horror game with plenty of monsters – and scares - Fantastic Contraption: originally a 2D machine-building puzzler, this works beautifully in 3D and VR - Tilt Brush: Google’s app is one of the early creative joys in VR: paint in the 3D space around you in a blur of neon - Jaunt VR: a great range of made-for-VR videos, from documentaries to music - Apollo 11 VR: clever historical app that puts you in the moon landing mission - theBlu: if you enjoyed the BBC’s Blue Planet, this is a must for its glorious VR ocean life - AltspaceVR: interesting attempt at social VR, updating the second life virtual world idea for current headsets © Bloomberg An attendee wears a Sony Corp. PlayStation VR headset to play a video game during a launch event in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016. Sony PlayStation VR The third big gun in the VR race is Sony’s PlayStation VR headset, which launched in October 2016 as an accessory for the PlayStation 4 games console. Both the PlayStation 4 and new PlayStation 4 Pro are compatible with the headsets, but the pro will run VR games at higher screen resolutions and frame rates. PlayStation VR will use the PS4’s standard console controller, the DualShock 4, but you’ll need the $60 PlayStation Camera accessory too. Sony is keen for PlayStation VR to be more than a solitary experience: a feature called VR Social Screen shows what you’re seeing in the headset on your TV screen, so friends can join in or watch. Being part of the PlayStation world inevitably means that games are an even bigger focus for PlayStation VR than for Oculus Rift and Vive. Sony has more than 100 games confirmed already, with 50 of them due to arrive by the end of 2016. Price: $399 (£350) for the headset, processor unit, earphones and cables. You’ll also need: PlayStation Camera, which costs $45 (£39). Although you can use standard PS4 joypads for games, some will support the PlayStation Move motion controllers, which cost $99 (£70) for a twin-pack. Best for: gamers – or PlayStation 4 gamers at least, since there’s (unsurprisingly) no cross-console compatibility with Xbox One or Nintendo’s consoles. Verdict: as the first console-connected VR headset out of the blocks, PlayStation VR is also the most affordable high-end model even if you have to buy the PS4 to run it. There are some impressive launch titles, while Sony’s clout means there will be a strong pipeline of titles in the months and years ahead, though there may be slimmer pickings for non-game VR apps. 10 PlayStation VR apps and games to try - Rez Infinite: brilliant reboot of classic rhythm game Rez - Tumble VR: clever puzzle game that involves piling up blocks - EVE Valkyrie: this space dogfighter game was specially made for VR, and it shows - Batman: Arkham VR: crime-solving strategy with the Dark Knight - Superhypercube: “first-person puzzler” with trippy graphics - Thumper: racing, shooting and rhythm-action combine - Job Simulator: a big word-of-mouth hit; its 2050 setting simulates jobs taken over by robots - PlayStation VR Worlds: from gangsters to racing, this collection of VR mini-games shows off Sony’s VR tech - Headmaster: use your noggin to complete a series of football-heading challenges - Driveclub VR: slick racing game puts you in the cockpit of 80 motors For a deeper dive into these games, see the Guardian’s VR apps roundup © Gabriel Grams/Getty Images for Samsung A festival goer experiences Samsung Gear VR at the Samsung Creator's Lab at Lollapalooza 2016 - Day 4 at Grant Park on July 31, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. Budget headsets Samsung Gear VR With Gear VR, we’re into the category of VR headset that use your smartphone as both the screen and processor. Samsung’s headset uses technology from Oculus VR, although it isn’t as powerful as the Rift. It only works with Samsung’s S6 and S7 smartphone series, as well as the Galaxy Note6 and Note7 phablets (though if you still have a Note7 put the device down and step away slowly – the phone has been the subject of an international recall after a problem with exploding batteries). Gear VR can be bought as a standalone device, but some retailers will include one in when you buy a new Samsung smartphone so it’s worth scouting about for deals. Games and apps are available through Samsung’s Oculus Home software, with a growing catalogue of apps, games and content. For Samsung owners, the Gear VR is an affordable way to explore virtual reality even if its graphical capabilities – and the processor of the device running its software – are less powerful than its rivals. Price: $100 (£100) for the headset. You’ll also need: a recent Samsung smartphone or phablet. Best for: cost-conscious VR newcomers who don’t want to be tied to a computer or console while exploring virtual worlds and games. Verdict: Gear VR should help grow a more mainstream audience for VR, and has a growing collection of apps and games. Its one restriction is that it can only be used with Samsung smartphone owners, so anyone with an iPhone or other Android handset is out of luck. 10 Gear VR apps and games to try - Land’s End: from the makers of Monument Valley, this is an eerie game of exploration - Minecraft: Gear VR: blocky building game suits VR well - Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes: clever multiplayer game – the headset wearer defuses a bomb while friends try to help - Smash Hit: inventive rhythm-puzzle game - Gunjack: sci-fi shooter that flings ships and bullets at you - NextVR: live sports and music in virtual reality - AltspaceVR: interesting attempt at social VR, updating the second life virtual world idea for current headsets - The Economist VR: intriguing virtual tours from the digitally re-created Mosul Museum to Osaka’s secrets - Jaunt VR: a great range of made-for-VR videos, from documentaries to music - Within: bespoke fiction and nonfiction videos made for VR  © Bloomberg Google Inc. Daydream View virtual reality (VR) headsets sit on display during a product launch event in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Oct., 4 2016. Google Cardboard and Daydream Cardboard was Google’s first commercial attempt at virtual reality, and yes, the headsets were made of actual cardboard. Google made the spec for these flat-pack headsets available to other companies, which means there are 13 models from Google’s own basic $15 model to Speck’s $70 Pocket-VR with CandyShell Grip, although the latter includes a protective case for your smartphone. There are a growing number of apps available on the Android and iOS app stores, from 360-photography to games and documentaries. While not as powerful as more expensive headsets, there is some exciting experimentation going on here. Google’s follow-up to Cardboard, Daydream, was announced in May 2016. Its software will be built into the new Android smartphones (it is part of Nougat, the latest version of Android) as well as hardware, in the form of headsets and handheld controllers. Google’s headset, the Daydream View, is made of fabric rather than cardboard, and comes with a motion controller used to translate your gestures into apps and games. Google services such as YouTube, Street View and Photos will all support Daydream headsets, and launch partners include Netflix, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Guardian, JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Major League Baseball who will all provide apps. The Guardian’s offering, Underworld, explores London’s subterranean web of Victorian sewers and lost waterways in the shoes of an urban explorer. Price: Google Cardboard headsets vary in price, but most are $15-$25 (£15-£25). Daydream View costs $79 (£69), including a controller. You’ll also need: a smartphone – Cardboard headsets and apps support a wide range of Android phones and iPhones. Daydream View is more restricted: at launch it will work with Google’s new Pixel smartphones, but a range of Daydream-supporting Android phones will come out over the next year. Best for: getting started with VR cheaply and easily, particularly for non-Samsung owners. Verdict: Daydream View will offer strong competition for the Gear VR. Cardboard is excellent for dabblers, and while some of its apps are fairly limited experiences, others offer plenty to see, do and play. 10 Google Cardboard apps and games to try - Cardboard: Google’s own collection of VR demos for Cardboard is a great place to start - Bohemian Rhapsody Experience: Google teamed up with Queen for this fun VR music video - NYT VR: the New York Times’ take on VR with video news reports - Star Wars: the film’s official app includes the story of Jakku Spy - Sisters: one of the scariest VR horror apps - Inside Abbey Road: virtual tour of London’s famous Abbey Road Studios - Cardboard Camera: shoot 360-degree photos with sound on your smartphone, then relive them in your headset - YouTube: the standard YouTube app, but you can watch its 360 and VR videos come to life through Cardboard - InMind VR: clever medical arcade adventure lets you travel into a patient’s brain - 6x9: the Guardian’s compelling exploration of the psychological damage caused by solitary confinement © Getty Images The Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality headset is demonstrated on stage during the 2015 Microsoft Build Conference on April 29, 2015 at Moscone Center in San Francisco, California. Microsoft in the wings As well as working on the augmented-reality headset HoloLens, Microsoft is working with hardware partners to make a range of headsets for Windows PCs, starting at $299 when they go on sale in the spring of 2017. “We’re really thinking how are we going to democratise this technology, how are we going to work with these partners to build devices that can reach all price points, that can reach everyone on the planet,” Microsoft’s Terry Myserson told ZDNet. “One way you can think about these VR accessories is as an external monitor. It’s not technically accurate, but conceptually I think it works quite well. You put on the headset and you’re looking at another monitor.” Accessories A slew of other virtual reality products are coming onto the market beyond the big-name headsets. The early success of Oculus Rift on Kickstarter has made the crowdfunding site a focus for VR startups touting interesting hardware. From headsets (Impression Pi, ANTVR, Cmoar, Opto, FOVE) to controllers (STEM System, Control VR, Gloveone, iMotion) there are plenty of projects to explore, although be warned – the Oculus, HTC, Sony and Samsung devices receive the lion’s share of attention, so you’ll need to research developer support for each device to work out if it’s compatible with your system before committing your cash. There is also the OSVR project by gaming hardware company Razer, which is trying to create open standards around VR so that people can mix and match different headsets and accessories. For now, there are two versions of its prototype hacker development kit available to buy, although Razer is hoping manufacturers will use its standards to make their own headsets. © Bloomberg The Ozo, a virtual reality camera, manufactured by Nokia Oyj, sits on display at the European launch in London, U.K., on Thursday, March 17, 2016. How do you film VR? The cameras and editing software needed to film and then knit together VR footage involve a whole other level of complexity and expense. At $45,000, Nokia’s OZO camera is out of most people’s price range but is a good example of the kind of kit that professional film-makers are using. More affordable is Samsung’s Gear 360 spherical camera, which costs $350, and which has front and rear lenses to capture 180-degree shots both horizontally and vertically to create panoramic video or photo. It’s still an expensive gadget for an average person, but if you want to explore making your own VR videos, it’s a good starting point. There are a number of other 360-degree cameras available, like the Ricoh Theta S, Kodak Pixpro SP360 4K Action Cam, LG 360 Cam, Giroptic 360cam and the Vuze Camera. It’s also worth keeping tabs on crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo as new camera projects pop up regularly. 360 vs virtual reality The terms “360” and “virtual reality” are often used interchangeably, but there are important differences. The 360-degree photos and videos are panoramic pics and videos that have been stitched together, so you can turn your head to look around you. But these aren’t virtual worlds: you don’t have free movement to explore them as you do in full virtual reality experiences. All VR devices offer a mixture of both, however: you can watch 360 videos or explore virtual worlds with Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard. © Reuters Rony Abovitz, founder president and CEO of Magic Leap (R) unveils a view of his companies augmented reality with Rio Caraeff, chief content officer, at the Wall Street Journal Digital Live ( WSJDLive ) conference at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach, California October 20, 2015. Augmented reality vs virtual reality There are other headsets that let you experience digital wizardry but offer a different experience called augmented reality.  While virtual reality is about immersing you in an entirely virtual world, viewed through a screen in your headset, the real world outside you isn’t part of the experience – at least not until you trip over the cat or accidentally knock out your child while immersed elsewhere. But augmented reality, as the name suggests, is about augmenting or adding to reality reality. You might be looking at your cat or up your street, but there could be digital characters and content overlaid on them. Glass, the high-tech spectacles launched by Google in 2014, were an AR device, but the company has given up on trying to sell as a mainstream idea. More hardware is on the way, however: Microsoft’s HoloLens will be the augmented reality equivalent of PlayStation VR and with a similar emphasis on gaming; the popular Minecraft has been one of the key demos for it. Meanwhile, a Florida-based startup called Magic Leap has raised an astonishing $1.4bn in funding for its AR headset and technology, giving only a few teasers on what it looks like and how it will work. For now, the most affordable way to try augmented reality is through smartphone apps, which overlay text and graphics on the feed from the camera. The game Pokémon Go and the face-mangling lenses in Snapchat both use augmented reality. Others are more specific: the DFS Sofa and Room Planner (see how a new sofa might look in your living room), Plane Finder AR (see where that plane overhead is going by pointing your camera at it) and Mardles (make 3D characters jump out of stickers for kids).  © Reuters An employee wears virtual reality glasses as he works on aircraft engine nacelle systems at Safran Nacelles plant in Gonfreville l'Orcher, near Le Havre, France, November 10, 2016. Virtual reality beyond gaming Games loom large in modern-day VR, partly because the original Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR headsets were made primarily for gamers, and also because games are the most easily-understandable entertainment category to show off this technology. But as Mark Zuckerberg explained after announcing Facebook was buying Oculus VR, there’s a lot more to this than just games. “This is just the start. After games, we’re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face – just by putting on goggles in your home,” wrote Zuckerberg. “This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.” Journalism and filmmaking Hundreds of developers are working on VR games, but there is lots of activity around other kinds of entertainment and media too. Journalists, filmmakers and a growing number of documentary-makers are using 360-degree cameras to find new angles on stories, if you’ll pardon the pun. Filmmaker Chris Milk set up his virtual reality company in 2014 to produce and distribute VR documentaries, and offers films shot in New York, Cuba and even Syria. “I’m not interested in the novelty factor,” Milk told the Guardian in 2015. “I’m interested in the foundations for a medium that could be more powerful than cinema, than theatre, than literature, than any other medium we’ve had before to connect one human being to another.” Traditional media companies have also experimented with VR journalism, from the New York Times VR films to the Guardian’s 6x9 project, which explores solitary confinement. As the cost of shooting and editing VR footage comes down, expect to see more media companies exploring the potential. Social media When Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was to buy Oculus, he said that virtual reality could be the next big social platform and connect more than a billion people. That seems a contradiction when the current version of software being created for these headsets is focused on solo experiences while wearing a device that isolates you from the people around you. Yet some companies are trying to make VR more social. Oculus has launched “Social Beta” software that enables people to watch online video services Twitch and Vimeo in a virtual cinema with other people. It has also showed off Toybox, a prototype virtual toy-room where two people can interact with a range of objects together. Tech startups are exploring social VR too. AltspaceVR wants people to “be together in a more natural way than a phone call, text or video chat” by creating avatars and wandering around its virtual worlds, and is available for some headsets already. Its rival vTime is available for Gear VR, Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard, styling itself as a “sociable network” for people to meet up for avatar-based chat. Sports and music Would you watch a football match or music concert in a virtual world? A number of companies hope so, and are busy building the technology. NextVR is focusing on sport and entertainment, and has already worked on the US Open tennis tournament and several boxing matches, as well as a live Coldplay gig. It is preparing to produce a series of music concerts with live promoter Live Nation. Another company, Voke, is working with stars including Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony, while LiveLike wants to broadcast sports matches in VR for friends to watch together while chatting. British broadcaster Sky recently launched a Google Cardboard app, which includes a sports show fronted by David Beckham alongside news reports and videos from Disney and Star Wars. TheWaveVR will soon launch its music VR app. Tourism One of the key selling points for VR technology is its ability to put you in places you’re unlikely to visit in the flesh, whether too expensive, too dangerous, out of bounds because of mobility issues or just because you don’t like flying. You can already use VR to climb Everest, explore the Grand Canyon, take a Gondola ride in Venice and watch a range of startling 360-degree videos published by wearable-cameras firm GoPro from around the world. Looking even further afield, Mars 2030 will let you wander around the surface of Mars. Oculus VR sees the potential in virtual travel. “There’s clearly value in real-world experiences: going to do things. That’s why we have field trips. The problem is that the majority of people will never be able to do the majority of those experiences,” claimed its founder Palmer Luckey in 2015. “People could say: ‘But visiting France virtually will never be the same as visiting Paris in the real world.’ Well, it might not be the same. What matters a lot more is that everybody is able to experience it.” Medical and therapeutic Virtual reality technology is also being explored by the healthcare industry. Medical Realities is a company using VR, AR and games to train medical students, with its Virtual Surgeon programme enabling them to experience operations from the surgeon’s perspective. The company live-streamed an operation earlier this year to test its tech. Osso VR, meanwhile, has developed surgery simulation for trainees, which works with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The Los Angeles Cedars-Sinai hospital is also exploring whether VR can have therapeutic value, helping patients relax by flying above Iceland in a helicopter or swimming with whales, while MindMaze is making VR software that could play a role in the rehabilitation of stroke, spinal-cord injury and amputee patients. Adult entertainment Well, this was inevitable. Porn producers are famous early adopters of new audio/visual technology, and that trend has continued into VR. From point-of-view videos to animated sex simulations – and even a dedicated VR category on popular site PornHub – if there’s money to be made from virtual reality, chances are the adult-entertainment industry will find it first. Even if the results are “cold, silly, downright terrifying” for some viewers.  © Reuters Game developer Marc Flury plays Kokoromi's Superhypercube on Sony's PlayStation VR during an event in San Francisco. What next? As a technology, virtual reality already has decades of experimentation (and hype) behind it, even if it is still early days for this latest generation of devices. That means you can expect the technology to improve rapidly, while the first few waves of apps and games are still figuring out how to make the most of it. There’s a good argument for waiting until the technology, and the content created for it, is more established, more compelling and cheaper. But equally, there’s delight to be had in being one of the first to explore a whole new virtual world of entertainment, information and communication, as thousands of developers, games designers and filmmakers explore the medium and its new creative potential. Whether you’re an enthusiast, a sceptic, or somewhere in the middle, 2017 is going to be a big year in figuring out the real potential for this technology.

"Let's hope that President-elect Trump takes on the dealmaker role," former U.S. chief technology officer Aneesh Chopra told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Friday. Though stock markets rallied in the sessions following Trump's election, tech stocks suffered. While Trump's campaign promised to crack down on key tech issues like immigration and jobs, there could be an opportunity to compromise on issues like infrastructure and taxes, experts said. Nicholas Kamm | AFP | Getty Images Eric Schmidt Visas for high-skilled foreign workers — called H1-B visas — are currently capped in the U.S., inciting calls for reform from tech leaders like Google's Eric Schmidt, who spoke from the DealBook Conference in New York City on Thursday. Schmidt said Google has brilliant engineers who are languishing in condos in Canada waiting to get to work. When the U.S. kicks out highly educated foreign engineers, "they go and build competitors to our companies," he said. But during his campaign, Trump was critical of tech's reliance on foreign workers, saying it prevented companies from hiring diverse, local talent. The H1-B visa might be reformable, Chopra said on Friday, so that more of the higher-end, really competitive, distinguished capabilities are taken into account. He said that PayPal co-founder and Trump supporter Peter Thiel could help that message resonate with Trump's camp. "Most everything these days that's done, whether it's industrial, or manufacturing, involves technology." -John Canally, Chief economic strategist at LPL Financial "My hope is that 'talent, talent, talent' becomes the new mantra to lift up those that are struggling in the economy," Chopra said. "That's a message that both parties have had a commitment to advance, maybe in slightly different approaches. But the core question is, can technology, data and innovation be a resource or a helper to make sure that everybody has the opportunity to get the skills they need to compete for the jobs of tomorrow." Trump has been vocal on bringing more manufacturing jobs into the U.S., which could involve new technology to make it cost-effective. But that's not the biggest opportunity available from Trump's current plans, Chopra said. "Smart manufacturing enables you to bring more and more of production jobs into the U.S. ... Technological advantages in the manufacturing process will economically make U.S.- based manufacturing more competitive, but the impact to the economy may not be as great," Chopra said. "The bigger opportunity is if he moves an infrastructure bill forward." John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial, also thought tech could be a beneficiary of infrastructure spending. "Most everything these days that's done, whether it's industrial, or manufacturing, involves technology," Canally said. "And I think the sector that's benefiting the most is financials. The financial sector is the biggest spender on tech. So tech's going to benefit there as well." Another optimistic trend could be Trump's proposal of a repatriation tax holiday, which could let tech companies bring some of their foreign cash holdings back to the U.S. at a more favorable rate, said Brian Jacobsen, Wells Fargo chief portfolio strategist. Still, tech investors have had to swallow a bitter pill this week when it comes to policy, Jacobsen said. In addition to Trump's stance on immigration, conditions in China also became more challenging. Trump has said he will impose tariffs on Chinese goods, though companies like Amazon trade heavily there. At $8.8 billion, China was the third-largest market for Apple last quarter, for example. China also passed a cybersecurity law on Monday that will tighten political controls on the internet. Meanwhile, tech companies that have a lot of growth left ahead of them might suffer if interest rates are likely to see an uptick, because it makes their future cash less valuable, Jacobsen said.

Now, accelerated mobile pages is expanding again. Google’s mostly-a-ghost-town social network Google+ now supports AMP pages, too… Per Googler John Nack, appropriately on Google+: Fast Web pages rock, and we’re making Google+ an even better place to read great stories by adding support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (https://www.ampproject.org/). Now when you browse G+ on the Web on your phone, look for the little lightning bolt icon to load articles up to 4x faster, using up to 10x less data. Enjoy, and stay tuned as we add support for more platforms and publishers in the near future. While this most likely won’t affect the lives of most human beings, it’s definitely nice for those of us — yes, I said us — who still use Google+ on occasion. AMP pages, much like on the mobile web, will be denoted by a lightning bolt icon. Nack says that they will load up to 4 times faster, and use up to 10x less data than normal mobile web pages.

By Conner Forrest | November 11, 2016, 11:13 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google RadarCat, a new object recognition technology from researchers at St. Andrews University in the UK, could improve retail checkout processes, make waste sorting easier, and even help the blind. The RadarCat tool was built using Google Soli—a miniature radar that was originally designed for gesture control tracking—which first appeared at the 2015 Google I/O developer conference. St. Andrews was among the first wave of organizations to receive the Google Soli AlphaKit in 2015, to which they added their own recognition software to build RadarCat, according to a press release. The name RadarCat is short for Radar Categorization for Input & Interaction. The proprietary software that the university built uses machine learning to help "train and classify different materials and objects, in real time, with very high accuracy," the release said. SEE: How Google's gesture control technology could revolutionize the way we use devices Basically, that means it can tell a user what object or material is placed in front of it. Additionally, the system also recognizes transparent materials and different body parts. For example, in one video it correctly identified the difference between a person's calf, and their pant leg.

Being that RadarCat can determine whether or not a glass is empty, it could potentially be used to signal a waiter that a patron is in need of a refill. It can also tell the difference between materials used to build an object, such as separating a porcelain plate and a ceramic plate. Since it is able to achieve this level of detail, RadarCat could eventually be used to help visually-impaired users better separate similar objects. The level of detail possible could also help RadarCat upend traditional retail checkout systems. In a demo video, RadarCat is able to tell the difference between an apple and an orange. If it were to advance enough, this could disrupt the labeling industry as well. Project Soli was originally developed by Google's Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group. As noted, its original intention was fine-tuned gestures control, as radar is highly-positional, and can read gestures well. Of course, the gesture control is still on the table, as RadarCat is just one expression of the Soli technology. Previously, experts had posited that it could end up in connected cars and AR or VR applications as well. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers St. Andrews University researchers used Google's Soli and machine learning to create an object recognition system called RadarCat. The system could be used to help visually impaired users differentiate between objects, or enhance retail checkout systems. Soli was originally intended for gesture control, and could still be used for that as RadarCat is one application of the technology.

Nexus devices were a great way to get the stock Android experience and latest updates all without breaking the bank. The Google Pixel starts at $649 and goes up to $869 for a Pixel XL 128GB version. That’s nearly double what the base Nexus 6P cost at launch. Because Google is focusing on premium devices that command a premium price, there’s a void in the $400 stock Android market right now. OnePlus and ZTE both released devices in this category this year that are going head to head with each other. The OnePlus 3 offers a near stock Android experience with a few tweaks found in OxygenOS, while ZTE offers a Stock Android skin on their ZTE Axon 7. Both the OnePlus 3 and the ZTE Axon 7 are amazing devices in the $400 category, with the Axon 7’s display, battery life, and audio slightly edging out the OnePlus 3’s better camera and superior software. If ZTE can address these issues with its next phone, presumably the Axon 8, then it could definitely be poised to be a stock Android competitor in the future. ZTE has been listening to its community this year and they’ve opened a poll on their website to ask why you prefer stock Android devices. They’re considering filling the niche that the end of the Nexus line left for people who want stock Android devices with fast updates. While ZTE traditionally hasn’t done very well in the update department with its handsets, the Axon 7 breaks that mold as ZTE has released security updates each month and plans for Nougat to be released by January. The ZTE community manager in charge of the poll says these results will be presented to their R&D team to determine if a stock Android device should be in the cards for the company, based on customer support. It’s nice to see manufacturers jumping in to fill the gap Google left behind with Nexus devices and if ZTE can continue to deliver amazing hardware while shaping up their software they could quickly become a go-to brand for the $400 device category. local_offer    Nexus 6P   OnePlus   OnePlus 3   ZTE   ZTE Axon 7   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (46) stars Further Reading The OnePlus 3T will be priced at $439 OnePlus 3T Specs This is the OnePlus 3T Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X get Pixel nav bar The OnePlus 3T leaks ahead of official announcement stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Are services like Airbnb and VRBO alive and well on the Midpeninsula? by J. Robert Taylor / Palo Alto Weekly J. Robert Taylor, J. D., a real estate attorney and broker for more than 20 years, has served as an expert witness and mediator and is on the judicial arbitration panel for Santa Clara County Superior Court. Photo by Nicholas Wright. / free articles read. Subscribe for unlimited access Read FAQ Are residential neighborhoods prime to become mini-hotel locations? With advent of the "sharing" economy when individuals can sign up to rent their home or a portion of it on a nightly basis they risk that owners or their tenants will seize the opportunity to make easy money. The pressure on residential neighborhoods from the commercial success of Google, Facebook, and many others comes from the high cost of office space (exceeding $7/sq.ft) and the cost of a hotel room exceeding $300 per night. While garages in our area have spawned many successful entrepreneurial ventures, think HP or Google, they tended to be owner or tenant users where the primary use of the property was for residential purposes and other use was incidental to that primary purpose. Zoning laws reserve the vast majority of neighborhoods in the Bay Area for single-family residential use and define "Family" as an individual or group of persons living together who constitute a bona fide single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit. In addition, the law clarifies that, "Family" shall not be construed to include a fraternity, sorority, club, or other group of persons occupying a hotel, lodginghouse, or institution of any kind. Historically, these ordinances have been interpreted so as to allow an owner to rent out their property to a group, meaning individuals who have come together to all sign a lease or rent the property as a group. In addition, the law has allowed individual owners to rent out a portion of their home to a tenant who shares common area with the owner. In both of these circumstances the tenant(s) is not a short-term (daily or weekly) occupant but has a month-to-month or longer-term tenancy arrangement with the owner. Some cities in the Bay Area have enacted further ordinances in the wake of these short-term rentals, most notably the City of San Francisco. These ordinances limit the owner to the number of days the unit can be a short-term rental during a calendar year and also requires the owner to register the property with the City and pay transient-occupancy taxes on any rent collected. There is an obvious negative financial impact to the hotel industry and on city coffers when transient occupancy occurs and no tax is collected. In San Francisco, the subletting of property on a short-term basis is also seen as removing affordable housing for families who want to rent on a long-term basis and cannot find housing due to the use of residential property for short-term rental. Most cities have sufficient clarity in their zoning ordinances to take action against illegal uses of single-family residential properties. However, they generally do not have the staff or the political will to get into what is always an awkward situation, when an owner is cited for a zoning violation. The wheels of government enforcement tend to turn slowly. In the meantime, neighborhoods may be besieged with traffic and a revolving trail of strangers roaming around their once peaceful street. There are legal risks to the owners who are engaging in this. Since I manage property, I have over the past few years had calls from prospective "tenants" who want to lease the property with the intent of setting up a hotel-like use and subleasing the property. The tenant never occupies the property, they just use the house as a vehicle for doing short-term rentals. If they can pack in enough people then they can make money off the difference between the rent contract and what they are subleasing the property for to daily renters. There are other attendant risks for the owner. The standard homeowner's policy does not cover the owner for a transient rental activity, thus if one of the renters suffered a personal injury during their stay the owner may not have insurance coverage to pay the claim. If you can find the insurance, my experience is that the cost will exceed any extra rental income you might generate. It would be mythical thinking to imagine that a service like Airbnb will pay for a claim made for personal injury on your property due to some defect. Your duty as a landlord/hotelier to a lodger is perhaps greater than to a typical tenant since you are often supplying your lodger with perks such as appliances and other furnishings that have the potential to be defective and injure the lodger. There are other risks as well. Most online short-term rental companies are not unregulated, unlike the real estate industry. A real estate broker has to put your funds in a trust account and has a fiduciary duty to both owner and tenant. Further, short-term rental facilitators may be violating real estate law if they advertise or facilitate rentals which are 30 days or more. Current real estate law was intended to exempt the short-term rental industry from licensing and regulation, but the entire definition of that industry has been changed by this new industry. Clearly there are areas where such transient occupancy is seen as a community benefit. What would happen in Hawaii if the vacation renter could not find condos? Or in Lake Tahoe if families or groups wanted to go on a ski vacation? The owners who have purchased property in these areas do so with the expectation that there will be vacation or transient use and that such use benefits the community. Owners who have purchased homes in the Bay Area did so with the expectation that they were moving into an area where they were joining a consistent neighborhood and where, heaven forbid, you might actually get to know your neighbor.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else.

We bring in an expert, WIRED’s own Peter Rubin, to chart all of it. Peter manages WIRED’s culture and entertainment coverage and co-hosts The Monitor, our culture podcast. Peter is also well-steeped in face computers: he’s written stellar stories about Oculus and he’s been testing and ranking each new VR system as it’s released.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently. But, maybe it doesn’t work super-great just yet. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Watch Google’s presentation from Tuesday, and read our roundup of everything that was announced.

SUBSCRIBE How to avoid an outbound link penalty from Google We've all heard of unnatural link penalties from having a spammy backlink profile, but columnist Tony Edward notes that your site's outbound links need to be monitored as well. Tony Edward on November 11, 2016 at 12:10 pm More Most of us are aware of link penalties that occur if you have low-quality or spam links pointing to your site. But did you know you can also be penalized by Google for how you link to other websites from your site? Yup, you sure can. It’s called an “unnatural outbound links” penalty, and similar to the inbound link penalty, it can be applied partially or sitewide. Recently, we conducted an audit for a new client, and we flagged the spammy linking that was being done in a particular section of their site. The content manager was unknowingly allowing guest bloggers to submit content to be published with links pointing back to their sites. This content contained a high volume of links and overoptimized anchor text. Our recommendations to remove these links were ignored and not seen as high-priority, despite our efforts to convey the severity of this issue. Then Google released the Penguin 4 real-time update. Soon after, our client’s site was flagged for a manual penalty. Below are screen shots from Google Search Console outlining the manual outbound link penalty for partial site matches. How to avoid an outbound link penalty Here are some tips to help you avoid an outbound link penalty: Avoid linking to spam and low-quality websites. Nofollow links in user-generated content by default, or simply don’t allow them. Don’t allow any links within guest post content that is published on your site, unless someone on your staff has manually reviewed and approved the links. Do not link to sites that are providing you with some type of compensation for doing so, such as money, goods for services or reciprocal links. Train your site’s content managers to be aware of who and what they are linking to. Reference Google’s Link Scheme resource page. What to do if you’re penalized If you’ve received an outbound linking penalty, you should take the following steps to facilitate a resolution: Identify the links on your site that are pointing to external websites. You can use a tool such as Screaming Frog (External Report) to identify outbound links. Audit these links to identify the ones that do not meet Google’s guidelines. Remove the problematic links, or add a nofollow tag to the links so they do not pass PageRank. Example: <a href="signin.php" rel="nofollow">sign in</a>
 Submit a reconsideration request in Google Search Console. Outline what changes were done on your site to remove the link issues. Be as detailed as possible, and outline what steps you have put into place to prevent this from happening again.

Several technology websites are reporting that a new model, believed to be called the OnePlus 3T, will arrive on November 15. The key difference appears to be an updated processor and a bigger battery, giving the new phone a better chance of competing with the iPhone 7 and the Google Pixel . OnePlus itself is throwing fuel on the fire with a tweet suggesting an incoming new product. The Snapdragon 821 is Qualcomm's most powerful mobile phone chip and the same one that's inside Google's Pixel. According to reports, the OnePlus 3T will keep the aluminium body, OLED screen and 6GB of RAM that the standard OnePlus has. However, other rumours suggest it will ship with the latest version of Google's Android OS. That means it will be compatible with Google's Daydream VR platform and you will be able to put it in the Daydream View VR headset. Read More Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3: Which is the best Android phone to buy in 2016? The OnePlus 3 is a great value smartphone Chinese company OnePlus has built its reputation on offering well-crafted and powerful phones at extremely reasonable prices. The standard OnePlus 3 is currently on sale from O2 and pay monthly subscriptions vary from 500MB to 20GB data, with tariffs from £28 per month and no upfront payment. You can find them all available on o2.co.uk/oneplus3 . It's unclear yet whether the new OnePlus would launch at a higher price or whether the company would shift the existing OnePlus down in price. If so, that would make it even more of a contender for the best value smartphone on the market. We'll have to wait until November 15 to find out for sure. poll loading Would you buy the OnePlus 3? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Smartphones Qualcomm Inc.

The APT group -- known variously as Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, APT28 and Strontium -- is widely believed to be behind hacks of the Democratic National Committee and other political figures this year. While Adobe distributed an emergency security patch for the flaw in its Flash player before Google's disclosure, the fix for the security elevation vulnerability in Microsoft Windows was left unpatched for more than a week. It was finally fixed on Patch Tuesday this week. "After the fix of CVE-2016-7855 in Adobe's Flash, Pawn Storm probably devalued the two zero-days in its attack tool portfolio," wrote senior threat researchers Feike Hacquebord and Stephen Hilt at IT security company Trend Micro Inc., based in Irving, Texas. "Instead of only using it against very high-profile targets, they started to expose much more targets to these vulnerabilities. We saw several campaigns against still-high-profile targets since October 28 until early November 2016." According to the researchers, Pawn Storm sent spear-phishing emails in early November to governments around the world. "In one of Pawn Storm's campaigns on November 1, the subject line was 'European Parliament statement on nuclear threats.' The email seemingly came from a real press officer working for the media relations office of the European Union, but in reality, the sender email address was forged. Clicking on the link in the spear-phishing email led to the exploit kit of Pawn Storm." Microsoft initially defended the delay, suggesting the Windows vulnerability could only be exploited against systems still vulnerable to the Adobe Flash use-after-free vulnerability that would enable attackers to remotely execute code and take control of affected systems. However, Terry Myerson, executive vice president at Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, admitted in a blog post that Microsoft was aware of a "low-volume spear-phishing campaign" run by the threat actor it calls Strontium. At the same time, he stated users of the Microsoft Edge browser on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update were protected from versions of the exploit seen in the wild. In other news: After giving users three days to prepare, the OpenSSL project team released a new version, 1.1.0c, and recommended users upgrade as soon as possible. This update fixes three security flaws in version 1.1.0, including a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability with a severity rating of high, which enables a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The advisory read: "TLS connections using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 cipher suites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS." This update follows a September patch release that aimed to fix over a dozen OpenSSL vulnerabilities. BearSSL, a new fork of OpenSSL written entirely in the C programming language, could mean more secure internet-of-things (IoT) devices. BearSSL, authored by Canadian security expert Thomas Pornin, is an attempt to write a not-your-average version of OpenSSL. Pornin stripped the software library of legacy protocols, including the removal of all SSL support, and made it able to support TLS 1.0 and all its subsequent versions. The BearSSL implementation fits in 20 KB of compiled code and consumes only 25 KB of RAM, so while it can work for PC and mobile OSes, Pornin said he hopes it will be especially useful for IoT platforms. This bare-bones version of OpenSSL is meant to be a "portable library that focuses on embedded systems" by design. Google continues to crack down on unsafe sites with its new "Repeat Offenders" tag as part of the Safe Browsing policy to flag deceptive embedded content. Now, sites that repeatedly violate Google's policies on malware, unwanted software, phishing and social engineering will be marked as Repeat Offenders, and the webmaster won't be able to request that the "unsafe" warning be dropped for 30 days -- something that could previously be done immediately and that malicious actors often took advantage of. "Over time, we've observed that a small number of websites will cease harming users for long enough to have the warnings removed, and will then revert to harmful activity," wrote Brooke Heinichen on the Google Security Blog. "As a result of this gap in user protection, we have adjusted our policies to reduce risks borne by end users." In other Google news, HTTPS usage continues to increase steadily, especially among Chrome users. According to data shared in a Google Security Blog post, "more than half of pages loaded and two-thirds of total time spent by Chrome desktop users occur via HTTPS," and those numbers are expected to continue to rise. Google encourages all sites to migrate to HTTPS for secure web browsing -- a continuation of its push toward HTTPS.

Scott worked with the Internet giant on its new Google Pixel phone, creating a collection of six special cases ($40 each at Google stores) that launched on Thursday. What makes Scott’s mobile art so momentous? While designers have created phone cases for their brands before, what sets Scott’s designs apart is that they are much more than pretty accessories — they’re high-tech and interactive, too. Each case has near field communication technology built into it, so when you snap one on the phone, it links to the mobile device — enabling two devices to seamlessly communicate. You can then download a wallpaper app that features specialized emojis (called “J’emojis”) that constantly change and even move around. There’s also a keyboard of those same J’emojis that you can use for texting your friends (the flaming money is especially funny). The case makes for a millennial dream phone that Jeremy Scott fans and gadget-lovers alike will no doubt eat up.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Project ARA developer prototype surfaces, specs revealed By John Hoff - November 11, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We know some of you were disappointed when Google finally announced that they were letting the modular dream of the Project ARA smartphone go. It feels like that has been a long time since, and no one has taken up the mantle to continue the fight for modular phones even though Google has opened up the technology they have for licensing. But just yesterday, the developer prototype of the ARA phone surfaced, and we now have a good idea of the specs. You remember that prototype Rafa Camargo – then lead engineer for Google’s Project ARA – was waving around at the 2016 Google I/O Conference? Well, the guys at Phandroid seem to have gotten their hands on it (or one exactly like it), and now they’re able to tell us what the specs are and how the feel of the device is. They’re saying that we can expect an in-depth Q&A article soon, but for now, we’re getting the specs. Project ARA (model A8A01) specs: Processor – Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 (MSM8994) RAM – 3GB Storage – 32GB internal Display – 5.46-inch, 1080 x 1920 (403 dpi), TFT-LCD OTM1906C Rear camera – 2.1 MP (16:9 aspect ratio), fixed-focus lens, 1080p video capture Front camera – 5.0 MP (4:3 aspect ratio), fixed focus lens, 1080p video capture Battery – 3,450 mAh Dimensions – 152 x 74 x 12.5 mm (without camera module) Weight – 190 grams (approximate) Connectivity – WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0 (LE), NFC Sensors – GPS, barrometer, light, gyroscope, proximity, accelerometer, magnometer, pressure, gravity Ports – 3.5mm headphone jack, USB Type-C Audio – Front-facing mono speaker, 3.5mm headphone jack, dual microphone Buttons – Power, volume rocker, module release OS – Android 7.0 (NMR1), API Level 24, Security Patch 2016-08-05 As you can see, the specs don’t read any different than any 2015 flagship, except that it’s running Android 7.0 Nougat. But Phandroid does intimate to us that this prototype is “60% thicker than most 2016 flagships.” We would assume that the market-ready product would have been thinner than this, but as per Phandroid, the prototype “feels like a brick in your hand.” We’ll watch this space and see what new info we can get on the prototype.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Don't Wait for Google—Get Night Mode Right Now on Android Nougat Carib Guerra 3 days ago Don't Wait for Google—Get Night Mode Right Now on Android Nougat It's now common knowledge that the blue light emitted by phone screens makes it harder to get a good night's sleep. Apple's Night Shift in iOS and its steamrolled predecessor, f.lux (still available for desktop computers), are attempts to combat these harmful effects by limiting the amount of blue light from the screen at certain times of day (nighttime, say). For Android users who installed the Developer Preview build of Android 7.0 Nougat, the included "Night Mode" feature was all set to do the same for them. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Night Mode was conspicuously absent from the final build of Android Nougat. People were understandably upset... and probably sleepy as well. Some even took to reporting the lack of Night Mode on the AOSP issue tracker as a "bug" in the new update. Now, one of these reports has been officially closed with its "status marked as FutureRelease." We'll just have to wait and see if that means that Google plans on reinstating Night Mode in a future update. But if you don't feel like waiting even one more sleepless night, there's a way to enable Night Mode right now on Android Nougat. You don't even have to be rooted, either. It's just a simple matter of knowing where to look and what to do. Check out the full step-by-step guide below to unlock this cool feature right now.

Skip to content Menu Home Google Apps Script Examples TAGS TAGSExplorer TwtrService Twitter Archive Contact Form Search for: MASHe The musing of Martin Hawksey (EdTech Explorer) Home 2016 November Using the Google Slides API with Google Apps Script Using the Google Slides API with Google Apps Script Martin Hawksey November 11, 2016 0 Share this: | Twitter | Facebook | LinkedIn Google recently announced the general availability of the Google Slides API. The announcement was accompanied by video from the new G Suite Dev Show presented by Wesley Chun embedded below, and a post by Wesley on Using the Google Slides API with Python. Wesley mentioned that “If you’re not a Python developer, it’ll be your pseudocode as you can use any language”, so that’s what I thought I’d do and share with you all in this post. Background The Slides API is something that’s been on my wishlist for a while and the Google Apps Script community has already been getting it’s teeth into it. First I came across a post my Spencer Easton in which he released a Google Apps Script library to use the Slides API (Spencer’s genius is to have a script that generates these libraries from the Google’s API Discovery Service .. basically an API of APIs). This was followed by a post from Romain Vailard highlighting how his Form Publisher Add-on now also support Google Slides. Romain also had a nice tip that as long as you had a DriveApp call in your code you could use the access token with the Slides API. So with these tips in mind I’ve created the snippet embedded below which includes Wesley’s code in the comments with the Google Apps Script equivalent. If you can’t be bothered with the copy and paste you can also make a copy of the final script project. In terms of setup there is not much to do and if you copied the script project you already have Spencer’s Slide API library enabled. The step I’m anticipating most people to trip up on is enabling the Slide API in the Google Developer Console so have included these steps in the .gif before the code. Discoveries Overall the Slides API seems to work well. One surprise is currently the CreateImageRequest needs an image url: The image is fetched once at insertion time and a copy is stored for display inside the presentation. Images must be less than 50MB in size, cannot exceed 25 megapixels, and must be in either in PNG, JPEG, or GIF format. This means you need a public url. I’m sure most developers could handle this, but I was surprised an option for a Google Drive file ID isn’t possible. As in Wesley’s example I’ve also got a file on Drive to use and to get a public url used another trick I got from Romain to use https://drive.google.com/uc?id=XXX, remembering that the file needs to be shared to authentication isn’t required to view. So lots of scope to doing interesting stuff with Google Slides now :) Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Related Posted in GDE, Google Apps Script, Google Slides Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Let's hear it for data over audio Google's new Daydream View VR is knocking out users' phones. Early adopters using the headset with Google's new Pixel phones have told El Reg that the phone shuts down within minutes because of thermal issues. A Reddit thread echoes the issue, where one user comments: It's remarkable that any phone is capable of longterm VR use, when to have a "VR experience" on a PC, it requires a +$300 CPU and a +$500 GPU, with fans everywhere you can think of! Still think the Pixel is still pretty remarkable and I personally can't wait for my Daydream to come so I can play with it and make toast with it. The issue isn't specific to Google. Modern smartphones with multicore SoCs have tremendous CPU and GPU horsepower, most of which, for most users, goes unused most of the time. VR does, however, and Samsung Gear VR users have gone to some extreme lengths to cool their handsets. But Google may have erred in choosing cloth, a natural insulator, as the material for its Daydream View VR headset – something of which it seems very proud. An insulating material such as a thick fabric makes it much more difficult for a hot phone to dissipate heat. UK users who have raised the issue have so far been given a generic email on setting up Daydream View. We called and emailed Google for an official comment, but have yet to hear back.® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 20 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Alle Stories Erstellt am: 11. 11. 2016 - 18:53 Uhr We're all cyborgs being farmed by Silicon Valley Activist, designer, and software developer Aral Balkan on digital slavery and how to combat it. Aral Balkan is an activist, designer, and software developer. He jointly runs a social enterprise called Ind.ie which "strives for social justice in the digital age." He told me why he's concerned about the practices of the big Internet companies and what his vision for the future of digital technology looks like. Christina von Poser Aral Balkan Joanna Bostock: You have said that we are all cyborgs, what do you mean by that? Aral Balkan: We don’t have to implant ourselves with technology to be cyborgs. Technology extends our biological abilities, so if you use contact lenses for example – you’re a cyborg, you’re extending your biological abilities using technology. When we get to something like our smartphones or our computers, then the amount of extra senses is profound and limitless. So in your view we need to start thinking about our digital rights as human rights? That’s right, there’s no separation between the two and that’s key. If we extend ourselves through technology it’s time to start thinking about extending the protections of the self to the technologies by which we extend ourselves. Is my smartphone a separate actor to me? For example, when I’m using the notes application on it, am I just having a conversation with an actor? If somebody is listening in, is that just traditional surveillance in the sense of signals capture between two actors, or is it something different? When I write a thought, is that me saving that thought onto my phone and thereby extending my mind, and thereby extending myself? And if that’s the case, then is surveillance something very different in that scenario? Is it an abuse of the self? If we don’t understand the nature of the self in the digital then we won’t be able to protect human rights in the digital age. CC-BY-SA 2.0 / Jan Persiel - flickr.com/janpersiel When I was a seven year old kid I got a personal computer. Back then computers didn’t spy on you, they were yours to own and control. I started programming at age 7, and I could create starfields and universes and little starships and fly through them. That was a magical, honest experience and we lost that. We went from mainframes which were centralised to personal computers, which was the first time we had decentralised technology owned and controlled by individuals. And then we got the Web. We thought we were getting this decentralised network, and the Internet is, but the Web isn’t. The Web is the mainframe 2.0. What really excites me is what’s going to be the personal computer of the Internet era – that’s what I’m working on, what I’m trying to create and understand, and that’s what I think we need to be focussing on. You said that "we need to start thinking about extending protections" - does that mean we have not yet started thinking about these things? I’m asking because we already hear a lot about privacy activism… We talk about privacy as if it is some lofty, first world concept, and it’s not, it’s a fundamental human right, at least it’s seen that way in Europe for a very good reason, because the other rights depend on it. What privacy gives you in relation to other, more powerful actors, like governments, and multi-billion dollar multinational corporations, is the ability to level the playing field, to level the power relationship. Today we live in a world in which governments and corporations know everything about us, and we don’t know anything about them. If I buy a Google Nest device for example, a camera, and I put it in my home, then they can look at me, but if I take a camcorder and walk into Google Incorporated’s offices then I will get arrested. You’re talking about Google, and it’s quite a concrete example… Right, it’s every Silicon Valley company basically, Facebook, it’s Snapchat, it’s Twitter. We’re talking about a business model here, a shared business model that revolves around learning as much about people as you can and then analysing that information, psychoanalysing it and then monetising that. So, the business model of mainstream technology today is what I call “people farming”. Google is a factory farm, Facebook is a factory farm, and what they’re farming is human beings. Not their bodies – we did that in the past, and unfortunately it’s still going on in many places, and we call it slavery. We don’t want your body anymore but what do we call the business of obtaining and controlling and owning and trading in everything else about a person that makes them who they are, apart from their physical body? That’s the business model of mainstream technology today. Does that mean we’re living in the age of digital slavery? We’re definitely living in a feudalistic system. We’ve created these CEO “kings”: the Mark Zuckerbergs, the Erich Schmits of the world. They have an inordinate amount of power and control over us. We talk about physical and digital – those two things are intrinsically linked, we can’t separate them. Imagine what I can do if I have enough data about you, imagine what these companies can do with enough data about each one of us, we call it profiling … But how much data about me physically is out there in the digital sphere? Well, unless you’re a hermit, way more than you realise. And it’s not just the data, remember the data is just the raw material. Data is very valuable but it’s when we mine it, when we analyse it – that’s when we derive value, that’s when we start making assumptions about you: this is what you like, this is what you don’t like, and here are the people you associate with, what does that say about you? Facebook has a patent for example, on giving you a credit score based on who your friends are and who you associate with on Facebook. China is already implementing this as policy: your social score in China will determine whether or not you are seen as a good citizen and get certain privileges. CC-BY-2.0 / greyweed - flickr.com/21986855@N07 Tell me about Heartbeat... Heartbeat is a project we started about two years ago, and it’s in pre-alpha because we’ haven’t touched it for eight months. “Pre-alpha” is just a term that we say when it’s not ready yet, and it sounds really cool … But you want people to know what you’re actually working on? Basically yes. Heartbeat is a decentralised, peer-to-peer social network. So when we’re having a conversation on Heartbeat it’s just you and me, no one in the middle. That’s the opposite of Facebook. In a decentralised system it’s peer to peer, just how it should be, and it can be ephemeral as well just like a conversation that’s not recorded. That’s actually really important because that’s how people grow. Are you the same person that you were when you were twelve years old? When you were fifteen? When you were 20? Did you learn, did you grow? What if you couldn’t forget the things that you said and did and every time you did something now what you did at twelve years old was brought back to you? We’d have a very different type of society. And that’s where Heartbeat comes in, it’s one prototype. Do you have any idea of when it might be something that people can actually get their hands on? Well this is really core to everything that I’m going to be doing this year and in the coming years, because what we’ve learned building that prototype and why it’s still at that stage is that we are going to need a huge amount of investment to take it from there to where it could actually be a scalable system that could be functional and do what it’s supposed to do. And for that, what I want to see happening is, at the European level, I think we need to start investing in decentralised technologies. So here’s my vision for a different future: what if, in Europe, every person gets a unique identifier on the Internet? We call them domain names today on the Web. You get a unique domain name and an encrypted node which is a live back up of your information, that’s always on. So you get that, as a European citizen, when you’re born. And that’s just one node though, every one of your devices that you own and control is another node, but people know where to find you from your identifier on the Web. Immediately we have decentralised the identifiers, because today you need Facebook – you go to facebook because your friends are there. But when you’re talking about everyone having an individual ID, that sounds like something that needs governments to put it into place… Not necessarily. Look at the domain name system as it exists today. Initially it was under the control of the US and that’s been relaxed. We had different domain registrars for example, working in an interoperable way. Interoperability is the key thing and you create a standard and then you enable lots of different groups to build upon that standard and maybe take it further and in different directions, and maybe innovate on top of that standard. The key thing we have to do here and what makes it 180 degrees different from Silicon Valley, is our goal has to be to build a healthy commons. Everything we build has to be supported by the commons and go back to the commons. So re-democratising? Yes! Reality Check Special: "We are turned into digital slaves" In this Saturday’s Reality Check Special (12-13) we meet the activist, designer, and software developer Aral Balkan, who explains how Facebook, Google and other Silicon Valley giants are turning us into digital slaves by spying on us and farming our data. He talks passionately about the possibilities opened up by the first personal computers, how that potential has been subverted by the evolution of the Web, he describes the infringement of our digital rights and maps the path to reclaiming our digital privacy.

Google “wankpuffin,” and the first result is Donald Trump By Clayton Purdom@claytonpurdom Nov 11, 2016 11:10 AM Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Share Tweet That’s right—go ahead and do it. Type in the word “wankpuffin” on Google and hit enter. There he is, the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, programmatically and algorithmically and contextually connected, via the super-powered information-gathering engines of one of the world’s biggest, most powerful companies, to the word “wankpuffin.” The term was originally brought to prominence when the composer Nick Harvey realized his mother had it as her username for her ISP. Last Christmas, this inspired the usual round of hashtag jokes, few funnier than Harvey’s original: .@BTCare I’m completely disgusted that my elderly mother has her BT WIFI installed with THIS as her username?!?! pic.twitter.com/FRKUxWv9t0— Nick Harvey (@mrnickharvey) December 25, 2015 Somehow, in the intervening months, a shadow campaign was waged to game Google’s algorithms so as to connect the term with the outside-shot reality star who’s bankrupted American culture the way he has everything else he’s ever touched. (If you know anything about that shadow campaign, please, get in touch.) Part of what makes the joke land is the way Google serves up Trump’s photograph and linked Wikipedia page, as if the user had actually just googled his name. The term “wankpuffin” isn’t especially funny compared to the many, many things that one might call President-elect Trump. Comedians and online writers have engaged in a years-long competition for the best ways to describe him, from Spy magazine’s classic “short-fingered vulgarian” through the endless gauntlet of insulting descriptors used by writers at Gawker Media sites. And if you google “xenophobic neofascist,” “racist con artist,” or just “rapist”—all terms that could be used to describe our president-elect—his name will appear, but his face will not. But his face does appear if you google “wankpuffin,” and that’s pretty good. It is nowhere near the “google problem” held by Senator Rick Santorum—which, to remind you, was when the advice columnist Dan Savage successfully lobbied to make the homophobic senator’s name a synonym for “the frothy mix of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex.” But “wankpuffin” is a start.

By Oliver Cragg November 11, 2016 17:49 GMT An image of some kind of owl-thing from Fantastic Beasts for Google Daydream View.Warner Bros. Google's new mobile virtual reality headset has arrived, giving Google Pixel owners the chance to sample the Alphabet company's superb VR ecosystem, Daydream. The headset itself – the Google Daydream View – is on sale for £69 in the UK, and the lightweight fabric kit is the perfect companion for any Pixel or Pixel XL user looking to sample the best the mobile VR space has to offer. For our full thoughts on the Daydream View and Google's Android-powered Daydream software, click here. Below IBTimes UK has collected the best Daydream apps and games currently available for download from the Google Play Store. Street View VR (Free) What was easily one of the best experiences for Google's bargain-basement Cardboard kits, Street View is improved exponentially thanks to Daydream View's bundled "wand" motion controller. Zipping about has never been easier as you simply point and click to dots around you, this makes exploring the 150 featured destinations – such as the Pyramids and the Taj Mahal – all the more fun and intuitive. You can also input almost any address from around the world; be it previous holiday destinations (I miss you, Tuscany) or former homes (where my cat has been immortalised for all to see). You can travel to suggested landmarks in Street View VR or input an address using the controller.Google EarthShape (£4.79) An entertaining sci-fi puzzler from the mind of Thomas Was Alone and Volume developer Mike Bithell, EarthShape's 25 levels task the player with bouncing orbs toward a goal by drawing deflective lines on a grid using the Daydream View controller. When each puzzle stage is completed one of a number of celestial flora will grow in the background – we think this is the first game in the "universal puzzle gardening" genre. It's also narrated by Sue Perkins of Great British Bake Off fame. It's all very, very lovely. Fantastic Beasts (Free) Turning Daydream View's "wand" into a virtual wand was surely something of a no-brainer, especially with Harry Potter spin-off movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them on the horizon. Created by the same visual effects company working on the film, Fantastic Beasts is a fun showcase of how developers can push the Daydream system and the potential of its motion controller. Experimenting with spells and potions in Newt Scamander's shack is a brief blast of wizarding fun, and the beasts are, well, fantastic. YouTube VR (Free) Aside from the millions of videos already uploaded to YouTube for your viewing pleasure, the growing quantity and diversity of the 360 degree videos on YouTube bodes well for its future in VR. Whether witnessing David Attenborough introduce an enormous dinosaur, submitting yourself to viewing freaky experimental horror projects or attending live musical performances, YouTube VR will only improve over time as more and more content creators catch on to Google's killer app. VR Karts: Sprint (Free) An obvious Mario Kart knock-off, but a serviceable – if a little bare-bones – recreation of Nintendo's classic racer. Plus it's free. VR Karts has a basic character customisation menu and a variety of courses, but its real strength is the controls. Power-ups can be aimed at rival drivers by directing your gaze at them, while steering the vehicle is done by holding the Daydream controller horizontally in two hands and tilting it from side to side. After a few laps you'll be zooming your way to victory – a good indication of the controller's potential for future driving games. Everybody Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (£9.99) The best multiplayer VR game to date is just as good on Daydream View as it was on HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR and the Samsung Gear VR. Strapping into Steel Crate Games's nerve-wracking bomb diffusing simulator is an absolute riot, as you are tasked with following (usually frantically delivered) instructions from friends and family who know which wires wires to cut (and which to 100% not cut under any circumstances) via an online manual. If you haven't tried it yet and have a Daydream, grab some calm, trustworthy allies and start dismantling those explosives together as soon as you can. Steel Crate Games The Guardian VR (Free) Referred to as a "marrying [of The Guardian's] experience of rigorous journalism with innovative storytelling", the UK newspaper's free app has been designed to transport "Daydreamers" to places and events they wouldn't normally be able to (and sometimes wouldn't want to) witness in real life. One of the "experiences" on offer at time of writing places the user in a solitary confinement cell in the US. The disquieting experience tries to convey what it'd be like to be stuck there for 23 hours a day, while another takes the subject to London's subterranean web of Victorian sewers and waterways. With updates and additions promised "every month or so", The Guardian VR is another fascinating example of VR's intellectual potential beyond formulaic games and low-resolution movie clips.

Top 4 Map Applications. November 11, 2016 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Travel/Leisure, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) If you’re using the default app for directions on your phone, you may want to rethink this decision. Some are pretty bad. For as good as Apple is at everything, their maps are notorious for sending people off cliffs and into lakes when they’re just trying to figure out how to get to their kid’s friend’s party (read: slight exaggeration.) Anyway, check out our top 5 apps so you can actually get where you’re going. 1. Waze Coming in at number 1, Waze is just awesome. It’s crowd-sourced so it can tell you where to avoid cops, traffic and even road kill in real time. It works when all of the users are invested in the system, so you have to be willing to update fellow drivers about the accident you just saw or the speed trap you just passed. What’s great is that it even lets you know how long you’ll be in traffic, and whether or not that traffic was caused by a stalled vehicle or a collision. Waze allows you to turn off the directions and only alert you of the events on the road, meaning if you already know where you’re going, from the top Texas destinations from east to west, you’re only getting relevant information about what roads to avoid and when to slow down. The only bad thing about Waze is that it doesn’t tell you which lane you need to be in, nor does it tell you which side of the road your destination will be on. 2. Google Maps Google owns Waze, but their app works differently. Google will tell you which lane to be in when you’re getting off the road and which side of the road to be on, and it will still route you around traffic too. However, it won’t tell you where the police are, or what’s happening with the hazards on the road. Still an excellent choice though for those in new cities who don’t know very much about how the streets work and where exactly they need to be. There is nothing worse than needing to get over 6 lanes in a half mile, and Google does a great job at preparing you for your next move. 3. MotionX GPS Drive You can have some fun with Waze, as they have celebs like Neil Patrick Harris and Steven Colbert give you directions in their famous voices, but this app takes the concept a bit farther. You can get practically any voice you want on this app, from sultry to silly. It gives you also directions back to your car when you inevitably forget which garage you parked in or cross streets you’re on. This is good for those who get bored by the voices on their driving apps, and want to mix it up a little bit or make their friends laugh when on a road trip. The only downside is that this app costs a few bucks a month rather than the first two choices which are both free. 4. Scout Constantly on the go, but never know exactly where to go? This app is for people who have lots of social engagements, possibly checking out the top 7 CA destinations for couples, but aren’t necessarily the best at narrowing down the options of what to do. Scout tells you where to find a burger place when you’re in an unfamiliar area, and then lets your friends both know where it is and where you are too. Comes with a calendar so you can keep track of everything you’ve got going on (and where all of those locations are.) There is a free version of this and an upgraded one with more features and less ads.

But instead of holding up its hands or allowing its knuckles to be rapped, Google has responded by saying its rivals are worse than it is and that its product makes the market more competitive, so there. Android hasn’t hurt competition--it’s expanded it. 'Android: Choice at Every Turn' https://t.co/O1U83wi93i — Google in Brussels (@GoogleBrussels) November 10, 2016​ However, what the tech giant omitted to say was that its operating system stops its rivals from being able to preinstall their own services an Android. The EC reckons that that Google is anti-competitive because it does just that — stops its rivals or other search engines from going anywhere near the settings functions of its Android devices. "Android is the most flexible mobile platform out there, balancing the needs of thousands of manufacturers and operators, millions of app developers and more than a billion consumers," Kent Walker, senior VP and general counsel for Google. "Upsetting this balance would raise prices, hamper innovation, reduce choice and limit competition," Walker added.  Pixabay EU Anti-Trust Chief Warns Google, Amazon Over Data Hoarding And when it says its rivals Apple and Microsoft are worse, what it means is that Apple's iPhone apps are all made by Apple; 39 out of 47 apps on a Lumia are Microsoft; but only 11 out of the 38 pre-installed apps on a Samsung Galaxy S7 are Google's. But the EC isn't really bothered about this — its beef is with the fact that all Android smartphone manufacturers must include the full range of Google apps — and just Google apps, which means that the Internet giant is abusing its power. Google's response is that, well at least they're free. "This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone, it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers," Kent Walker said. ...

SUBSCRIBE Getting a clearer picture of local marketing attribution It can be a challenge to get a clear picture of how effective your local marketing efforts are, so columnist Brian Smith outlines some of the more effective methods for tracking in-store attribution. Brian Smith on November 11, 2016 at 9:46 am More There’s a reason many brands don’t track in-store attribution for local marketing: it’s hard. Really hard. I’m reminded of the old adage that says half the money you spend on advertising is wasted; you just don’t know which half. Similarly, half your customers walk into your store as the result of local marketing; you just don’t know which half. Proving that someone visited your store because they saw your online local marketing efforts at some point is a complex undertaking. Most out-of-the-box attribution tools don’t make it easy to differentiate between local marketing traffic and a visit from someone who stepped out of a local restaurant and happened to see your store right across the street. There’s also the challenge of seeing over the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Bing and the other major platforms to compare notes. In a world of last-click attribution, it can be difficult for brands to determine which media influence had the biggest impact on their local efforts, especially when multiple touch points, both online and offline, national and local, blur your attribution model. In truth, it’s impossible to get a perfect picture of your local marketing effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are ways to get a clear enough picture that you can form reasonable assumptions about the in-store success of your campaigns. To help you make sense of it all, I’ve outlined some of the more effective methods for tracking local marketing in-store attribution. The most accurate method (and most expensive) would be to integrate all of the in-store attribution methods I’m about to list. But a smarter approach would be to pick and choose the right attribution models to fit your needs. Google Analytics: the foundation of local marketing attribution When it comes to tracking local attribution, start with Google. More people search on Google than anywhere else. So in terms of measuring your local marketing performance, Google will provide you with a solid glimpse of your local marketing effectiveness without having to cobble together additional sources. The simplest way to get picture of your local marketing attribution would be to track keywords with local intent and site visits on your local pages, and then extrapolate for in-store visits. For example, according to Google, 76 percent of nearby searches on a smartphone result in a store visit within a day, 28 percent of which result in a purchase. You can use numbers like these to estimate the impact that local should have had on in-store visits. Keep in mind that the percentages of store visits change across devices and across industries. For improved accuracy, you’ll need to refine your percentages based on your own brand-specific research. But if you want to take your attribution model to the next level with Google and actually track in-store conversions, you’ll need to upload your Google click identifier data (GCLID) back into Google. Unfortunately, this process is complex and requires you to jump through multiple hoops. Many brands find this process to be such a hassle that they opt for the simpler solution of estimating in-store visits through keywords and site visits. The do-it-yourself approach: Coupon codes and apps There are internal initiatives your brand can take that will provide you with insight into your local marketing campaigns and the impact they had on your brick-and-mortar locations — namely, coupon codes and app tracking. Coupon codes are a great way to know if a customer saw an online ad and visited an actual location. By designating a specific local code on your coupons, if a customer shows up at that store with the online local code in hand, you can officially tally one in the win column for local. Your app is another easy way to measure attribution for local marketing campaigns. Actions like looking up a store location, viewing an in-store map, check-ins, collecting rewards, or getting people to opt in to share their location data can go a long way to tracking concrete in-store visits. At the very least, you’ll have a good idea of how effective your app is at bringing in people locally. There’s a downside with apps, though. You do have to be a big enough brand that people think to download your app. Additionally, your app also has to be useful enough that those who download it actually use it. For that reason, SMBs won’t reap the same benefits as brands like Starbucks and their app’s cult-like following. Beacons Beacons are one of the more exciting local attribution technologies. By simply placing a beacon at your front door, you can gain a pretty good idea of who is walking into it. Beacons are in the early stages of adoption, but as more companies deploy them and customers get used to interacting with them, I’d expect this to be one of the primary ways of tracking attribution. After all, getting people to opt in to constant location tracking will continue be a challenge. Getting people to accept beacon notifications only when they’re near locations and at times of their choosing is far less intrusive and therefore more likely to be adopted. The problem with beacons is that you need to have the specific store app enabled or the user won’t see it. The good news is that Google Chrome on Android will soon be getting beacon support, and this should help break down app barriers and speed up adoption. Expect Google Eddystone and maybe Facebook Bluetooth beacons to dominate the beacon space. I say Google because more people use it for search than anything else. I say Facebook because one should never underestimate the power of social. Facebook Social is a sector that no local marketer can ignore. Fortunately, Facebook is working hard to help you with attribution through Store Visits and their Offline Conversions API. Store visits, which you can find in Ads Reporting, measures the number of people who saw one of your Facebook campaigns and then visited a store. Meanwhile, the Offline Conversions API will help you link store sales to Facebook ad campaigns by matching transaction data from your customer database or point-of-sale system to Ads Reporting in real time. The downside of these two methods is that Facebook makes their estimates based on the number of people who have opted in to share their location data. The upside is that people are far more likely to share their location data with Facebook than most other platforms, so it still provides you with a pretty decent picture of your local marketing performance on social. Foursquare Foursquare Attribution also has a similar ability to capture online-to-offline attribution through its pool of 1.3 million users who have opted in to constantly share their location data. Foursquare then tests the visit rate of those who have seen a specific ad versus a control group that hasn’t seen the ad to determine its effectiveness. The advantage of Foursquare is that it tracks ads across the larger web and app ecosystem, helping you to see into some of these walled gardens. As with Facebook, the downside of Foursquare Attribution is that it’s limited by the number of its opt-in users. Ride-hailing services A developing attribution method to keep an eye on is one that’s implemented through ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. If a customer clicks on an ad or the link on your local landing page to request a ride to that location, you have a pretty good idea that the user actually went there. The downside of this tracking method is that it gives you a fairly narrow view, even more so than Facebook and Foursquare, simply because your insights are limited to the small pool of customers who use Uber and Lyft. But as ride-hailing services grow in popularity and become cheaper through autonomous driving, expect this method of attribution to increase in importance and accuracy. Choosing the right attribution methods for you With so many attribution options, how do you go about determining which methods to employ for measuring local marketing success? The truth is, even if you implement all of the above approaches, your view into online-to-offline attribution will still be incomplete. Clearer, but still incomplete. My advice to you is, determine the metrics you wish to track, and then pick the methods that measure them best. This will undoubtedly require you to define what actually constitutes a store visit. Is it someone who simply set foot in your store because of a local marketing initiative? Is it a store visit that resulted in a transaction? And what about e-commerce? Should e-commerce be counted as a store visit if the sale was generated by a local ad on a store’s local landing page? Once you’ve answered these questions, you can then move on to effectively and efficiently track local marketing in-store attribution.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A How to Manage Your Google Search Console Like a Pro by Olesia Korobka  |   November 11, 2016  |  1,590 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Google Search Console (previously Google Webmaster Tools) is a free service by Google that allows you to check your website's indexing status and to optimize its visibility for searchers. To adjust your website in Google Search Console, you need to go to the dashboard and select your site's main property. If it's www, then select that choice. If you have an SSL certificate, you'll have to select the property with "https" (with or without www—depending on your main mirror). Let's start from the Search Appearance. We'll go from top to bottom. Search Appearance Structured Data This is where you can see whether Google finds any structured data on your website (including manual highlights from Data Highlighter, which we'll be looking at more closely later on). If there are any errors, there will be a notification that looks like this: Microformats with errors don't work, so it's better either to either remove them or to fix the issue. If schema.org is already implemented correctly for your site, you can just remove those formats with errors. Good markup will help search engines to better understand the contents of your webpages. There's no direct evidence that those may improve your rankings, but rich snippets designed wisely (not for the sake of appearance) influence the user experience (UX); user behavior, in turn, implicitly affects rankings. Rich Cards These are, again, part of structured data. You should definitely use rich cards if your website provides one of these types of information: Recipes Events Products Reviews Your snippet in search will look fantastic, for example in the case of recipe pages, where images are allowed. Data Highlighter Sometimes, you have certain limitations and cannot modify your website to input microdata. You should use Data Highlighter then. It's very easy to use and Google has detailed instructions for it. It allows you to mark similar pages in a group one at a time. I do recommend using it, even if you have structured data on your website, especially in the case of new sites. Sometimes it helps to find out whether some pages that you thought had been indexed are in fact not indexed. Example: The same page when you check it for being indexed: HTML Improvements Here's what you should see ideally in this section: However, if you have some on-page SEO issues, you will see those. They usually include... Title tags Meta description Non-indexable content The problems with those may be as follows: Missing tags Duplicates Long tags Short tags Non-informative I recommend you deal with those even for the pages that are not promoted. Sitelinks This section is usually used in two cases. The first is when you want to demote the link from search. For example, if you have two pages ranked for the same keyword and the one you are promoting is ranked lower in search, then you may want to demote the other one. Otherwise, you may want to polish your branding search results. If you want another page to be shown under your main URL, you should demote the one you don't want to be there. A very simple and yet effective tip. There are also Accelerated Mobile Pages in the Search Appearance section. We won't look at those in detail here, because that can be another very long article. Search Traffic Search Analytics This is much more convenient to look at in your Google Analytics account; however, there's a lot of marketing data here as well. And it's another, indirect method to see whether your page is indexed; if there are no visitors from search, and it's not even mentioned there, then it's highly probable that it's not indexed. You may also analyze some actual queries, pages, countries, etc. (see image, below). It is also very helpful for analyzing how many image or video clicks you get from search (filter > Search Type > Image/Video). And here you can estimate the clicks on your pages in search that were shown with optimized snippets. In this case, it seems worth it: Links to Your Site You can track how many new links appear to your website. This information may be important when you have to deal with spam link attacks from your competitors; if that's the case, you'd have to check it daily, and swiftly add the new spam links to disavow. In other cases, it's much more convenient to track it from your Analytics account; there you'd be able to see the exact pages visitors are coming to your site from (Referral Traffic). Internal Links If your promoted page is important, it should have a relevant number of internal links leading to it. Again, if you have one page getting ranked for a certain keyword instead of another you are promoting, just check how many internal links lead to both of them (and also the anchors of those links). The promoted page's internal links should outnumber others' and should also have relevant anchor text. Manual Actions You'd usually receive a notice if there are any manual actions to your site (usually because of webspam). However, if you suddenly face a dramatic search-traffic decrease, come to this section to check whether there are any problems. International Targeting You can check your webpages' language settings here (if hreflang is configured properly), and specify your country targeting in cases when your domain lets you do so. If you have a regional domain, you won't be able to; the country will be detected automatically. Mobile Usability The information here is the same as in Google PageSpeed Insights. However, here you may see how many pages (and which ones) actually have the problems listed. Those are also available to download, so that you can send the file to your webmaster to fix the issue. Google Index Index Status You can see how many pages are indexed by Google, but you cannot see which ones. The number is often less than the one you get with "site:" operator in Google. It's useful to compare the numbers to try to figure out which pages are not in index and why. Content Keywords These influence your website topic relevance. If you want to get ranked, say, for marketing, but have nothing associated with that in your top 20 keywords, you'll have hard times in trying to move your site to the top. It's worth keeping in mind, however, that keyword stuffing may lead to your website's being penalized. Thus, some balance has to be kept. Don't start to stuff your page with commercial keywords. Try adding them bit by bit, and measure the results. Blocked Resources Your rating in Google falls if your robots.txt blocks some important js, css, or image files on your website. That is easy to deal with; if you find any problems here, Google help will guide you on how to unblock those. Remove URLs Sometimes, after hiring a webmaster (and quarreling with them until the sparks fly), you may find that your website is not longer visible in search. If it's a WordPress site, you'd go and check whether it's blocked in wp-admin. You'd also check the robots.txt and everywhere else. If no other issues are found, come and see this section; there may be a removal request here. It that's the issue, remove the request, and wait till your website is indexed again. The same goes for your other pages that are not indexed: Check them here. There may also be a case when you don't want one of your pages to be visible through search. You've already excluded it from the sitemap and added it to robots.txt, but it's still there. You should then add it in this section. Crawl Crawl Errors Some crawl errors are critical, others are not. From time to time, there may appear very strange URLs that you don't really have on your website. That can be some old data (deleted content still stored in the cache) and Google may keep it for months until it finally removes it. But errors can reflect real problems on your website. You shouldn't have real pages with a 403-404 response. If there are any, just fix the issue swiftly. Sometimes, it helps if you improve your indexing. Finally, when suddenly you are starting to have lots of 404 pages that don't really exist, and there's no problem with your website, that may be, again, your competitors buying spam links to your website. If that's the case, delete those by marking errors as fixed and adding the resources that provide those links to your disavow file. Crawl Stats See how often Google bot visits your site. It's also useful to look at the "time spent downloading the page" report—the highest and the average times. Try not to have more than three seconds—and the less, the better.

We can bet you’re having a sensible chuckle right now, because when you Google ‘wankpuffin’ this is what you’re presented with: (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Google) PAHAHAHAHA. Ahem. Sorry. Rampaging sheep kills 94-year-old man That’s right – someone has set it up so that whenever someone Googles ‘wankpuffin’, President-elect Donald Trump’s bio comes up. We don’t know who exactly did this, but we are thrilled. If you’re wondering what a wankpuffin is or what all those Metro.co.uk articles are in the results (holla!), it’s basically a word that went viral last Christmas when composer Nick Harvey mocked up this wifi image and tweeted it out. .@BTCare I'm completely disgusted that my elderly mother has her BT WIFI installed with THIS as her username?!?! pic.twitter.com/FRKUxWv9t0 — Nick Harvey (@mrnickharvey) December 25, 2015 The new Google result for ‘wankpuffin’ hasn’t escaped Nick’s attention, either.

Trump and his running mate Mike Pence have vowed sweeping changes that critics say would make it insurmountably difficult for women to acquire contraception and abortions. Their proposals include de-funding Planned Parenthood, dismantling the Affordable Care Act, and overturning Roe vs Wade which bans states from criminalizing abortions.  And leading figures in the Republican party, which now holds a majority in the House and Senate, have applauded the policies, promising to push through the changes as early as possible.  Reacting to the result on Wednesday, thousands of people took to Twitter urging women to get a long-lasting IUD coil before the new administration is sworn in, in case prescriptions for the Pill are no longer covered on insurance. And according to Google Trends, the tweets had an effect.  Last 7 days: This graph shows how searches spiked for IUD coils the day after the election Last 30 days: Looking back at Google Trends shows how significant an increase it was Last 90 days: Many warn Donald Trump's healthcare reforms may remove contraception from the medications that are free under the Affordable Care Act. An IUD coil lasts up to 10 years Last 5 years: There has been growing interest in IUD coils as previous fears over a defunct hormonal version decades ago finally fade. But Tuesday's election sparked a peak in interest WHAT IS AN IUD COIL?  The IUD, a small, T-shaped copper device that is inserted in the uterus, creates a hostile environment for sperm, preventing pregnancy.   It can be used as emergency contraception up to five days after intercourse - a move which is particularly recommended when a woman is ovulating (14 days between her periods) since the morning after pill ('Plan B' in America) is less effective at that time.  It also provides long-term contraception which can last for up to 10 years. There are two kinds: the hormonal (Mirena) coil, and the non-hormonal (copper) coil.  The hormonal coil can stay in the uterus for 10-15 years, and is associated with lighter periods.  Though the non-hormonal coil is sometimes associated with heavier periods, it has gained popularity as one of the few forms of contraception that sidestep the side effects of hormonal contraception in women, such as mood swings and skin problems.  Searches for the devices on Google rocketed to their highest point in the search engine's history on Wednesday morning.  The climb began at 11am, peaking at 9pm.  As of Friday morning, the number of searches remained above average.  Planned Parenthood, one of the key targets in Trump's campaign, is the leading provider of clinics for abortions, contraception, and sexually-transmitted disease tests across the US.   The Affordable Care Act covers all FDA-approved birth control without cost to those who have insurance. Though Trump has yet to outline the details of his plans for the ACA, many fear contraception prescriptions may lose coverage.   The IUD, a small, T-shaped copper device that is inserted in the uterus, creates a hostile environment for sperm, preventing pregnancy.   It can be used as emergency contraception up to five days after intercourse - a move which is particularly recommended when a woman is ovulating (14 days between her periods) since the morning after pill ('Plan B' in America) is less effective at that time.  It also provides long-term contraception which can last for up to 10 years.

A contraceptive jab for men? Injection that lowers sperm... Share this article Share But Tuesday's result sparked a peak in interest.  The device is overwhelmingly the preferred method among medics, given its more than 99 percent effectiveness rate.  And a study released in September found rising numbers of women getting the IUD coil has coincided with a dramatic drop in teen pregnancies across America.  Between 2007 and 2012, the number of new mothers aged 15 to 19 years old dropped 5.6 percent.   According to the authors of the study, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, the latest data unequivocally shows contraception is the root cause of today's lower figures, rather than a drop in sexual activity.   The IUD, a small, T-shaped copper device that is inserted in the uterus, creates a hostile environment for sperm, preventing pregnancy There was a notable climb in use of 'effective' contraception methods, like the IUD coil, the Pill and the injection, rather than condoms. In 2012, 3 percent of teens were using the IUD coil or implant, up from one per cent in 2007. Rates of teens getting the injection went up from six per cent in 2007 to seven per cent in 2012, and the Pill went from being used by 26 percent of sexually-active teens to 35 percent. Condoms rates also went up. In 2007, 49 percent of teens used condoms. Now, more than half (55 percent) do.      Share or comment on this article e-mail 80 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

 The BBC is launching a virtual reality film Hannah Roberts Nov. 11, 2016, 10:09 AM 428 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Turning Forest is the BBC's first virtual reality film. YouTube The BBC is launching a new virtual reality film — a fairy tale called "The Turning Forest" — next week. The film – which will be available on Google's £69 virtual reality headset — tells the story of a young child and a fantastical creature embarking on a journey together into a new realm of "folkish dimension and boundless imagination," the BBC said. The VR story — which has its own "spatial" soundtrack — is meant to be heard via headphones to enhance the experience. The BBC has released a trailer for the film on YouTube: The Turning Forest was originally created for the Oculus Rift headset, but will only show on Google's "Daydream View" headset — pictured below — which is so far only compatible with the new Google Pixel phones. Daydream View is designed like the things you wear, not the things you plug into a TV. pic.twitter.com/HLLohb02N8 — Jon Wiley (@jonwiley) 4 October 2016 The film was produced by the BBC's research and development department and virtual reality production studio VRTOV and is part of the company's drive to "explore emerging technology and new storytelling mediums for future audiences," it said. Zillah Watson, executive producer of BBC R&D, said: "The Turning Forest is unique in that it's been designed from the sound up, using state-of-the-art audio to help transport people to a magical world. It takes advantage of decades of research and experience from our own team, partners and universities to create a beautiful soundscape that we hope people will love."

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Suite updates bring new features to mobile apps By Ida Torres - November 11, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Being able to work on your documents even when mobile has become an important factor for a lot of working people who are digitally savvy. Apps are downloaded or not downloaded depending on that aspect of being able to do on your mobile devices what you can do on the desktop version. The whole Google Suites, which includes Docs, Sheets, and Slides, has now gotten an update which should make things even easier when working on your smartphone or tablet. Whenever someone mentions you in any of the Google Suite apps, whether it’s in a comment or a task or even just sharing a document with you, you’ve probably received it in your Google Drive Android app. But now, if it’s on any of those apps mentioned above, you’ll also receive a notification there specific to the one you’re working on. So if you are mentioned on Sheets for example, then you’ll receive a notification from the Sheets app instead of Google Drive in general. This will happen if you have the updated version of the apps of course. Sheets is the app that is getting some significant updates as well. You can now resize rows and columns on your Sheets app by specifying their pixel sizes. You will also now be able to create and edit data validation criteria and even change the color of the sheet tabs so it’s easier if you’re working on a sheet with many tabs. You can update Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides on their respective Google Play pages. We look forward to what the next updates will bring us.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 15, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Why local matters, even for national advertisers Local Mobile 11 Nov 16 | Jason Tabeling Facebook0 Linkedin68 Google+11 Twitter 79 There’s been a lot of talk recently about personalization as Google, Facebook, and others continue to roll out new targeting features. These features like Customer Match and Custom Audiences allow advertisers to target consumers based on previous data captured. These targeting capabilities have been incredible at driving improved return on investment. I think these features are not only better for advertisers, but also consumers. However, what I continue to find interesting in these campaigns is the lack of focus on localization. Location The power of location is incredibly valuable, especially with the growth of mobile. According to eMarketer, 93% of retail sales still happen in-store. Google data shows that 66% of people want ads customized to their location. Now I understand why localization is often over looked. It’s harder to manage ads at local levels. Things are just easier to manage at scale, one bid, one keyword, one ad. Localizing things still requires a tremendous amount of effort, but effort that is well worth it, even for those brands that are truly national or ecommerce only. I took a look at national conversion data and the top five volume states. What you can see is Texas has the highest Cost Per Sale than any of the other top five states, but has the second highest conversion rate. So how could this be? This is a combination of multiple potential factors that include competition, bid strategy, product availability, and many more. If you are looking at the campaign at a national level you’d miss this data. If you went a step deeper you might say Texas is not worth the investment if you could get more volume from the better performing states. However, breaking down even the performance in Texas you find some great areas of opportunity. Several of the largest volume cities are below the total average. So as with most things you can’t just throw the baby out with the bath water. However, because it is difficult to scale this type of analysis brands simply elect for the easier path and manage at a national level. So if we know that consumers want localized content/ads and performance varies significantly by state and city what is the best way to take advantage of this knowledge? Here are four ideas to consider: Duplicate and break out high volume areas You don’t need to break out every single city, but identifying key markets where the volume will significantly impact total results can make a big difference. This means both high and low performers. Just because you sell nationally doesn’t mean you need to advertise and pay for traffic nationally. ABT – Always Be Testing Take a run at some key markets with different ad copy and landing page experiences. What are the ways that showing localization to your customers can drive impact? Is it mentioning their local city in the copy? Is it using local images on the landing page? Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin68 Google+11 Twitter 79 Related articles Nine mobile trends to help you stand out in 2017 and beyond Google’s mobile-first index: how to prepare your business Reader survey: calling all mobile marketing technology firms, agencies & service providers Google Home Services ads come to mobile search (then disappear again) Experience your brand as a customer This suggestion has shown up a few times in articles I’ve written, but it just make sense. I find too often brands create the strategy, but never experience the execution of that strategy. Do a search for your brand as a customer locally might. Does your brand appear the way you want it to? Are the competitors and their offers what you expected them to be? Usually brands are surprised by how different the real world is vs. Pressure test the metrics you are using This is a big one for local. So many brands view success of online marketing as online sales. However, it just isn’t that simple. Many consumers want to transact in person and an online sale just doesn’t that into account. Now the industry hasn’t figured this out yet, but it is no different for TV and other offline channels and billions of dollars still go to those channels. Why? Because they work and people know it in their gut or from their own experiences as consumers. If you can’t tie specific offline sales data to online behavior there are two things I recommend; Value non-conversion events like “Find a Store,” “Contact Us,” “Phone Calls.” Just use some math to determine these values. Create a waterfall flow of consumer behavior to determine ROI. Go from impressions, clicks, store visits, in store conversion rate, average order size to get estimated revenue. There are third party studies by Google and others to help create valid assumptions. Here’s an example – https://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search_research-studies.pdf Overall location maters in all that we do in our lives and this fact will never change. Heck I live in Cleveland and when I cross the city to the east side I feel like I’m in a different country. I’m sure you as a consumer feel the same way.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 15, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Five most important search marketing news stories of the week Industry More News 11 Nov 16 | Rebecca Sentance Facebook0 Linkedin23 Google+11 Twitter 34 Welcome to our weekly round-up of all the latest news and research from the world of search marketing and beyond. I hope all of our readers are holding up okay after the absolute bombshell development that took place earlier this week. I’m talking, of course, about the news that Facebook is to begin delivering its Audience Network to television devices, bringing a new level of ad targeting to the space. (What did you think I was referring to?) Also in search news, Google Home Services ads appear in mobile search before disappearing again; a look at how Google Symptom Search will affect the healthcare industry; and Match.com is the top-ranked dating site for paid search advertising. Facebook is bringing its Audience Network to television Audience Network, Facebook’s answer to Google AdSense, is an increasingly important asset for Facebook as it sets out to address ad load challenges that could become a real problem in 2017. Al Roberts wrote this week on Search Engine Watch about how Facebook’s advertising efforts will enter a new frontier as it begins delivering video ads to consumers using devices like AppleTV and Roku. Roberts explained: Initially, it won’t sell inventory to marketers. Instead, it will serve up house ads for Facebook services or nonprofits it works with. To target ads, Facebook will use the IP addresses of connected TV devices to identify the Facebook accounts that are likely associated with those devices. Google Home Services ads come to mobile search (then disappear again) Last Friday, Andy Favell reported for Search Engine Watch that Google has been trialling Google Home Services ads on mobile in a clear sign that Google intends to roll the GHS beta program out to its mobile platform. The brief trial gave us a glimpse at what the ads will look like when they do arrive on mobile, and how the format will differ from desktop. In his article, Andy Favell recaps the history of Google Home Services and considers the possible effect it might have on the future of mobile local search. How Google Symptom Search will affect the healthcare industry We’ve all heard the jokes about WebMD and its shaky diagnoses, or hypochondriac internet users who self-diagnose with any number of horrific illnesses without once consulting an actual doctor. But Jonathan Catley believes that Google Symptom Search is revolutionising the healthcare industry, and doctors should embrace it as an opportunity to provide better care. Writing for Search Engine Watch this week, Catley explained that Google Symptom Search is aimed at counteracting the amount of inaccurate information about illnesses floating around on the web. Symptom search represents a big step forward in the fight against misinformation in the digital patient path to treatment. Currently available only on mobile, the feature allows users to enter just a few symptoms, yielding a short, vetted list of related conditions, possible causes, and treatments. It’s designed to avoid alarmist diagnoses while focusing on the most likely causes of your condition. Catley believes that Google Symptom Search forms part of the “consumer-driven disruption in healthcare”, which encompasses businesses like Dispatch, Pager, and MedZed as well as remote patient monitoring technologies and start-ups like BeWell Connect.

Match.com ranks top for paid search advertising According to research by AdGooroo, Match.com was the top ranked dating site in terms of paid search spend between January and October 2016. In order to put together the ranking, AdGooroo looked at 312 top branded and non-branded keywords being sponsored by dating advertisers in US Google desktop text ads. Image: AdGooroo Match.com, which is owned by InterActiveCorp, not only spent more than $5.7 million on the keyword group during time period examined, it also drove more clicks than any other advertiser during the period. Meanwhile, the dating site which got the best value for its clicks was zoosk.com, spending just $1.2 million but driving close to 4.9 million clicks, at an average cost per click of $0.25. Check out Adgooroo’s blog post for full details of the study and analysis of the rankings. Donald Trump is the first earned media president Finally, unless you’ve been completely cut off from the world around you or just woke up from inside a cave, you might have heard the news that Donald Trump has been elected 45th president of the United States. Al Roberts wrote an insightful piece on our sister site ClickZ about how Trump may well be the first ‘earned media president’ of the United States, after Barack Obama became the first ‘social media president’ in 2008. Roberts looks into how Trump’s campaign succeeded despite spending far less on advertising than his opponent Hillary Clinton, and how his willingness to criticise and attack the media itself actually worked in his favour. While the experts will have to explore and debate the reasons the Clinton campaign failed to live up to their expectations, just as President Obama’s 2008 campaign made it clear that future campaigns couldn’t ignore social media, President Elect Trump’s 2016 campaign has made it clear that future campaigns will not be able to ignore earned media.

For humans, the easiest way to learn about an object’s properties – whether it is hot or cold, light or heavy, sharp or blunt – is to pick it up and explore it with their hands. Now AI engineers at Google’s DeepMind are training machines to learn the same way, by exploring the physical properties of virtual blocks in order to compare them. Google’s DeepMind is teaching machines to learn through play, by exploring objects through simulations to work out their properties LEARNING THROUGH PLAY  Through a series of experiments in a virtual environment, a team from Google's DeepMind was able to train an AI to explore like a child, by 'playing' with virtual objects and exploring their properties. In one experiment, the AI compared virtual blocks to find which one was heaviest, by poking them. A second test tasked the AI with working out the number of components used to make up a tower. Explaining the work, the group said: 'In the past few years deep learning has gotten really good at understanding the world through passive observation, but a lot of human understanding as pointed out above comes through interaction as well.'   Using simulations, they enabled machines to work out hidden properties of the virtual objects by manipulating them. If a child were presented with two blocks painted black, one made of wood and one made of lead, he or she could work out the blocks' basic properties through playing with them. The shape and colour of the blocks is obvious at a glance, but the weight of the blocks is a ‘hidden’ property, which can be worked out by picking up the blocks and comparing them.

Share this article Share 25 shares In the first experiment, they used a ‘which is heavier’ test for their AI to compare hidden masses of blocks, by ‘poking’ all of them before making a decision on which had the greatest mass. They found the harder the task was, the longer the AI spent collecting data – spending more time poking blocks to explore their properties before making up its mind. A second trial was set up in a block building simulation, where the AI was tasked with working out the building blocks which made up a rigid tower. In the trial, the machine learned by poking the virtual tower, knocking it over and exploring the way the blocks landed to work out their properties. If a child were presented with two blocks painted black, one made of wood and one made of lead, they could work out their basic properties through playing with them. So why can't machines learn the same way?  Earlier this week, researchers in Italy launched a new project to develop robots which learn by themselves, using a form of open open-ended machine learning. Pictured is the iCub robot, an open source platform used to test AI and cognition ROBOTS CAN LEARN LIKE CHILDREN Earlier this week, researchers in Italy launched a new project to develop robots which learn by themselves, using a form of open open-ended machine learning. Called goal-based open-ended autonomous learning (GOAL), the project aims to make independent robots which set their own targets and would be a breakthrough for artificial intelligence. The £3million ($3.7m) project will see researchers develop robots which can learn like a child. They will expand on previous work which looked at intrinsic motivations (IMs) in learning and iCub robots as hardware.  Initially, a team in Paris will focus on how children set learning goals, to dig into how humans motivate themselves to learn. Two other groups in Germany will tackle the hardware for the project – with a Frankfurt team developing new visual systems and a ‘brain’, while robotics experts in Darmstadt will build a prototype. The project expects a prototype to be in action by the end of the project, in 2020.  Some of the blocks in the tower were stuck together, so the only way for the AI to find out how many separate blocks made up the virtual structure was to poke it and see what arrangement the components made when they were apart. Using a trial and error approach, the machines learned they had to knock the towers over to solve the puzzle. Writing in an as yet unpublished paper, posted on the online ArXiv server, the researchers explain: ‘By letting our agents conduct physical experiments in an interactive simulated environment, they learn to manipulate objects and observe the consequences to infer hidden object properties. They add: ‘We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two important physical understanding tasks – inferring mass and counting the number of objects under strong visual ambiguities.’  Commenting on the potential applications of the work, DeepMind's Misha Denil said: 'I think right now concrete applications are still a long way off, but in theory any application where machines need an understanding of the world that goes beyond passive perception could benefit from this work.  'This might include machines that can manipulate complex materials, or machines that can navigate precarious terrains for things such as disaster response.'  Developing machines that learn through play could prove to be a fruitful avenue for pushing AI forward.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 11.11.16. 11.11.16 Time of Publication: 10:00 am. 10:00 am Allen Institute for AI Eyes the Future of Scientific Search Getty Images Google changed the world with its PageRank algorithm, creating a new kind of internet search engine that could instantly sift through the world’s online information and, in many cases, show us just what we wanted to see. But that was a long time ago. As the volume of online documents continues to increase, we need still newer ways of finding what we want. That’s why Google is now running its search engine with help from machine learning, augmenting its predetermined search rules with deep neural networks that can learn to identify the best search results by analyzing vast amounts of existing search data. And it’s not just Google. Microsoft is pushing its Bing search engine in the same direction, and so are others beyond the biggest names in tech. This morning, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a not-for-profit created by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, unveiled a search engine it calls Semantic Scholar. It uses machine learning and other AI in an effort to significantly improve the way the academic world searches through the increasingly enormous corpus of published research. Pointing to recent improvements to the Google search engine, Amazon’s product recommendation engine, and the Facebook News Feed, Allen Institute CEO Oren Etzioni says the organization is trying to leverage many of the same techniques for the academic community. Etzioni likes to talk about “the Moore’s Law of scientific publication.” Judging from the research papers already indexed by the new search engine, the volume of academic research is increasing at an exponential rate, and one independent study says that the number of papers is increasing about 4 or 5 percent a year, with 2.5 million published in 2014. That means researchers just don’t have the time to look through everything. They need some help. “They need a way to deal with this overload,” says Marti Hearst, a professor at the University of California Berkeley whose research focuses on search engines. “And with improvements in user interface design and AI, we are seeing tools that can make it easier.” The Allen Institute search engine is designed not only to help scholars find the papers they’re looking for but also surface the specific results and images that can serve their own research. It does this with a variety of techniques, including natural language processing algorithms that can better understand what the paper is saying and computer vision technology that can identify tables and photos in the paper and extract them. “We want to transform from a keyword exercise to something that is using semantics and AI,” Etzioni says. Initially, the new search engine will focus on neuroscience and computer science research, covering over 10 million papers, but the organization plans on expanding into other subjects. By next year, it says, the service will cover all biomedical literature as defined by PubMed, the existing medical and science database. The techniques that underpin Semantic Scholar are hardly groundbreaking, but the tool at least points in the right direction. And after so many recent advances in machine learning across the tech world, the promise is that we can get there. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Listen to a home appliance tell jokes for 15 minutes By Joe Blevins@joe_a_blevins Nov 11, 2016 7:00 AM Literally Just 15 Minutes Of Google Home Telling Jokes (Screenshot: YouTube) Literally Just 15 Minutes Of Google Home Telling Jokes (Screenshot: YouTube) Share Tweet Google Home, a device no one needs but many will want for precisely that reason, is a small, voice-activated speaker capable of answering questions and carrying out certain commands that don’t require arms or legs. It sort of looks like a Renuzit air freshener from an optimistic, Jetsons-type future. You can also ask it for a joke. So that is exactly what Seattle’s David Chen did, for a video called “Literally Just 15 Minutes Of Google Home Telling Jokes.” It doesn’t take much to get this thing going. “Okay, Google,” Chen says, “tell me a joke.” Multicolored lights blink to life on the top of the cylindrical device, and a calm, even-toned, female voice declares, “Whoever invented knock-knock jokes should get a no-bell prize.” Funny, right? From there, Chen just keeps saying “Okay, Google, tell me another one” over and over, and Google Home gamely replies with joke after joke. “After about eight minutes or so,” Chen writes, “the jokes started to repeat. Towards the end, Google Home actually seemed to break down for a second, overwhelmed with the rate of joke-telling.” Plenty has been written about how the internet of things is a pseudo-revolution engineered to make people buy more expensive lightbulbs and refrigerator doors. If the appliances of the future are going to tell us jokes, they better come correct.

Now Gmail users can 'undo send' from the iOS app. PHOTO: Ayo Ogunseinde Google is tinkering with Gmail again — this time, with a redesigned iOS app that it said makes email “a lot faster.” According to a blog post from Matthew Izatt, Gmail product manager, the new app has a "fresh new look." Google also made it easier for users to switch between functions. He said this makes it feel like a proper mobile app rather than a clunky desktop app shoved onto a mobile device. The new design is the result of customer demand for “highly requested features” like easier message deletion, easier archiving and easier email management, he said.  One of the welcome features is “Undo Send,” which already exists on Google's desktop Inbox service. Undo send gives users a short window of opportunity to recall an email.  Google also improved search and spelling suggestions for terms in search, he noted. This is the first time in four years Google has updated its iOS app for Gmail. The new version is a lot like the Android version, which has been present on Android devices for the past two years. What is surprising about this week’s upgrade is that it has taken Google so long to do it.  By improving the Gmail experience on iOS devices Google is also working its way into the iOS user market where it could well make gains. However, gains are likely to be minimal for the foreseeable future as there is still work to done here. For those iOS users who were hoping to get a unified inbox that would cater for both personal and work accounts, the wait goes on. For now, users will have to maintain multiple accounts, a bit of a nuisance. That said, Google just keeps doing what it has been doing for years: Releasing small, incremental improvements, the same way it built up its G Suite. Google has also upgraded its iOS Calendar, which now includes a month and week view, Apple’s Spotlight Search and alternative calendars like Lunar, Islamic or Hindu. Xerox Split Is Official Xerox is now officially two companies. Earlier this week, the board of directors of the printing and document management giant approved the financial terms of the split, which was announced in January. The two companies will start trading as separate entities on the New York stock exchange early next year. The company that will group together the business process services — Conduent — will trade under the symbol CNDT, while the company that consists of the legacy equipment businesses, document technology and outsourcing,  Xerox, will trade under the symbol XRX. Earlier this year, Norwalk, Conn.-based Xerox, unveiled the name Conduent, noting it was inspired by experience connecting clients through “transactions at a massive scale” in areas such as customer care, transportation solutions and healthcare payer and provider services. On Dec. 31, Xerox shareholders will receive one share of Conduent common stock for every five shares of Xerox common stock they own as of Dec. 15. Konica Minolta Expands ECM Offering Ramsey, N.J.-based Konica Minolta Business Solutions continues to develop its enterprise content management (ECM) offering, this time with a number of upgrades to Dispatcher Phoenix ECM. The upgrades are designed to make capturing data easier and more efficient. With Dispatcher Phoenix ECM, organizations can capture, organize and store business documents in content management systems, including Microsoft SharePoint, OnBase by Hyland, Box, Dropbox and Google Drive among others. This edition of Dispatcher Phoenix ECM comes with batch scanning and indexing tools to make data capture faster and more efficient, forms processing and the ability to covert documents into Office documents or PDFs. It also comes with a new web-based verification tool that allows operators to check the quality of the scanned images in the batch, easily approve or reject documents, zoom in and out and page through documents using a variety of keyboard shortcuts. "By launching this high-volume batch scanning, indexing and advanced capture solution, we have taken ECM solutions to a new level. Speed is the name of the game and it starts with getting accurate data and making it available as easily and quickly as possible,” Kevin Kern, senior vice president of Business Intelligence Solutions and Product Planning at Konica Minolta said. In a lot of the discussion around enterprise content management, it is often forgotten that unless information is captured effectively, ECM will not work. Konica Minolta has spent a lot of time and effort in the past on improving the speed and accuracy of capture. This release of Dispatcher Phoenix ECM continues that effort. Google Photos, Adobe Photoshop Express Integrate Finally this week, San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe is integrating its Adobe Photoshop Express app with Google Photos. This means that users will be able to import and export image from the Google Photos app to Photoshop Express for quick editing and sharing. Google Photos is a photo and video sharing and storage service by Google. Its core features were previously embedded within Google Plus, the company's social network. Adobe Photoshop Express is a Flash-based image editing web and mobile application used to directly edit photos on blogs and social networking sites. It already supports Adobe’s Creative Cloud, Dropbox, Facebook and the iOS Camera Roll. Adobe has also added Collages to the app, an intelligent layout tool that enables users populate images in a carousel of collage options in one tap so users can see what they’ll look like in a variety of formats. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Everything You Thought You Knew About User Experience Is Wrong Hubspot Unveils GrowthBot, a Chatbot for Sales & Marketing Digital Customer Experience Is a Business Priority, CMSWire Survey Says Nextiva Debuts NextOS for Workplace Communication, Engagement 5 Places Where Social Collaboration Tools Help Business Processes Digital Hub Platforms Can Improve Enterprise Collaboration Microsoft Connects SharePoint Team Sites to Office 365 Groups 3 Things to Know Before You Hire Across State Lines Useful Article?

Nov 11, 2016, 08:45 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Network-1 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NTIP) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Network-1 had the largest quarterly revenues in its history with revenue of $34,326,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with revenue of $3,008,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenue of $31,318,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to additional licensing revenue of $31,000,000 from settlement and licensing agreements entered into with Apple Inc. and Dell, Inc. during the quarter.   Revenue from royalty bearing licenses for patents decreased $232,000 or 14% from $1,658,000 to $1,426,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Network-1 had revenue of $59,963,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to revenue of $10,382,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenue of $49,581,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to additional licensing revenue of $31,000,000 from settlement and licensing agreements  with Apple Inc., and Dell, Inc. as well as a $17,500,000 settlement of a professional liability claim.   Revenue from royalty bearing licenses for patents increased $70,000 or 1% from $8,593,000 to $8,663,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Network-1 reported net income of $10,832,000 or $0.46 per share (basic) and $0.43 per share (diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net income of $407,000 or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Network-1 reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $22,882,000 or $0.98 per share (basic) and $0.93 per share (diluted) as compared with net income of $1,717,000 or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  At September 30, 2016, Network-1 had cash and cash equivalents of $57,759,000 and working capital of $50,179,000.  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, Network-1 entered into settlement and license agreements aggregating $5,000,000, a portion of which will be recorded as revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Network-1 incurred current Federal, state and local income taxes of $3,817,000 and $26,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  The increase of $3,791,000 in such taxes was related to Network-1's full utilization of NOLs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with significant net income.  In September 2011, Network-1 initiated patent litigation against sixteen (16) data networking equipment manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, for infringement of its Remote Power Patent. Network-1 has now reached settlement and license agreements with twelve (12) of the original defendants.  The remaining four defendants in the lawsuit are Avaya Inc., AXIS Communications Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, and Juniper Networks, Inc. Network-1 seeks monetary damages based upon reasonable royalties.  The litigation is currently scheduled for trial in 2017. The Remote Power Patent relates to, among other things, delivering power over Ethernet cables to remotely power network connected devices including, among others, wireless access points, VoIP telephones and network cameras.  In June 2003, the IEEE approved the 802.3af PoE Standard, which led to the rapid adoption of PoE.  The IEEE also approved the 802.3at Power over Ethernet Plus (PoE Plus) Standard, which increased the maximum power delivered to network devices to 40-60 watts from the current 15 watts under the 802.3af Standard. Network-1 currently has twenty-five (25) license agreements with respect to its Remote Power Patent, which include, among others, license agreements with Cisco Systems, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Dell, Inc., Netgear Inc., Alcatel-Lucent USA, Sony Corporation, Shoretel Inc., Microsemi Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and several other data networking vendors. On April 4, 2014 and December 3, 2014, Network-1 initiated litigation against Google Inc. and YouTube, LLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of several of its patents which relate to the identification of media content on the Internet.  The lawsuits allege that Google and YouTube have infringed and continue to infringe certain of the Company's patents by making, using, selling and offering to sell unlicensed systems and related products and services, which include YouTube's Content ID system.  In December 2014, Google Inc. filed four petitions to institute Inter Partes Review (the "IPRs") at the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") pertaining to patents asserted in the litigation. In each of the four IPRs Google sought to invalidate certain claims of the patents at issue within the Cox Patent Portfolio. On June 21, 2016, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision in the four pending IPRs finding eighty-six (86) claims "not unpatentable" (valid) and, in total, one hundred and nineteen (119) out of one hundred and twenty-nine (129) or 92% of the challenged claims of the patents have survived Google's challenges in the IPRs.  None of the claims of the patents being asserted in the pending litigations against Google and YouTube were found invalid. On August 18, 2016, Google filed Notices of Appeal to appeal the Final Written Decisions on the IPRs to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 13, 2015, Google filed a Petition for Covered Business Method Review (CBM) at the PTAB seeking to invalidate claims pertaining to Network-1's U.S. Patent No. 8,904,464, the patent asserted in the Company's litigation against Google and YouTube filed on December 3, 2014 as referenced above.  On October 19, 2015, the PTAB issued an order instituting the Covered Business Method Review on certain grounds. The oral hearing took place on May 11, 2016.  On October 18, 2016, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision in favor of Network-1 with respect to the CBM and ruled that Google had failed to show that any of the thirty-four (34) claims of the Company's patent at issue were unpatentable.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Network-1 Reports Record Breaking Third Quarter 2016 Results NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Network-1 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NTIP) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Network-1 had the largest quarterly revenues in its history with revenue of $34,326,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with revenue of $3,008,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenue of $31,318,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to additional licensing revenue of $31,000,000 from settlement and licensing agreements entered into with Apple Inc. and Dell, Inc. during the quarter.   Revenue from royalty bearing licenses for patents decreased $232,000 or 14% from $1,658,000 to $1,426,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Network-1 had revenue of $59,963,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to revenue of $10,382,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenue of $49,581,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due primarily to additional licensing revenue of $31,000,000 from settlement and licensing agreements  with Apple Inc., and Dell, Inc. as well as a $17,500,000 settlement of a professional liability claim.   Revenue from royalty bearing licenses for patents increased $70,000 or 1% from $8,593,000 to $8,663,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Network-1 reported net income of $10,832,000 or $0.46 per share (basic) and $0.43 per share (diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net income of $407,000 or $0.02 per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Network-1 reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $22,882,000 or $0.98 per share (basic) and $0.93 per share (diluted) as compared with net income of $1,717,000 or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  At September 30, 2016, Network-1 had cash and cash equivalents of $57,759,000 and working capital of $50,179,000.  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, Network-1 entered into settlement and license agreements aggregating $5,000,000, a portion of which will be recorded as revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Network-1 incurred current Federal, state and local income taxes of $3,817,000 and $26,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  The increase of $3,791,000 in such taxes was related to Network-1’s full utilization of NOLs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with significant net income.  In September 2011, Network-1 initiated patent litigation against sixteen (16) data networking equipment manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, for infringement of its Remote Power Patent. Network-1 has now reached settlement and license agreements with twelve (12) of the original defendants.  The remaining four defendants in the lawsuit are Avaya Inc., AXIS Communications Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, and Juniper Networks, Inc. Network-1 seeks monetary damages based upon reasonable royalties.  The litigation is currently scheduled for trial in 2017. The Remote Power Patent relates to, among other things, delivering power over Ethernet cables to remotely power network connected devices including, among others, wireless access points, VoIP telephones and network cameras.  In June 2003, the IEEE approved the 802.3af PoE Standard, which led to the rapid adoption of PoE.  The IEEE also approved the 802.3at Power over Ethernet Plus (PoE Plus) Standard, which increased the maximum power delivered to network devices to 40-60 watts from the current 15 watts under the 802.3af Standard. Network-1 currently has twenty-five (25) license agreements with respect to its Remote Power Patent, which include, among others, license agreements with Cisco Systems, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Dell, Inc., Netgear Inc., Alcatel-Lucent USA, Sony Corporation, Shoretel Inc., Microsemi Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and several other data networking vendors. On April 4, 2014 and December 3, 2014, Network-1 initiated litigation against Google Inc. and YouTube, LLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for infringement of several of its patents which relate to the identification of media content on the Internet.  The lawsuits allege that Google and YouTube have infringed and continue to infringe certain of the Company’s patents by making, using, selling and offering to sell unlicensed systems and related products and services, which include YouTube’s Content ID system.  In December 2014, Google Inc. filed four petitions to institute Inter Partes Review (the “IPRs”) at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) pertaining to patents asserted in the litigation. In each of the four IPRs Google sought to invalidate certain claims of the patents at issue within the Cox Patent Portfolio. On June 21, 2016, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision in the four pending IPRs finding eighty-six (86) claims “not unpatentable” (valid) and, in total, one hundred and nineteen (119) out of one hundred and twenty-nine (129) or 92% of the challenged claims of the patents have survived Google’s challenges in the IPRs.  None of the claims of the patents being asserted in the pending litigations against Google and YouTube were found invalid. On August 18, 2016, Google filed Notices of Appeal to appeal the Final Written Decisions on the IPRs to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On April 13, 2015, Google filed a Petition for Covered Business Method Review (CBM) at the PTAB seeking to invalidate claims pertaining to Network-1’s U.S. Patent No. 8,904,464, the patent asserted in the Company’s litigation against Google and YouTube filed on December 3, 2014 as referenced above.  On October 19, 2015, the PTAB issued an order instituting the Covered Business Method Review on certain grounds. The oral hearing took place on May 11, 2016.  On October 18, 2016, the PTAB issued its Final Written Decision in favor of Network-1 with respect to the CBM and ruled that Google had failed to show that any of the thirty-four (34) claims of the Company’s patent at issue were unpatentable.

After riding the path to the White House in part thanks to his anti-immigration rhetoric, Trump is now casting a shadow over the tech industry’s use of high-skilled foreign labor. Chief among the interests of industry luminaries is the potential expansion of the H-1B visa program, one of the Valley’s primary sources of overseas talent acquisition. Now, a Trump presidency puts that initiative at risk. Because Trump has flip-flopped on the topic in the past, it’s uncertain whether he’ll heed the advice of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and others to allow more foreign-born computer scientists and software engineers to fill US jobs. In fact, despite his supporters’ defense that Trump is focusing on illegal immigrants, his proposals may in fact undermine legal immigration in ways the tech industry has never seen before. Trump’s proposals may undermine legal immigration in ways the tech industry has never seen before “This was essentially a right-wing populist campaign. A big share of that populism was a belief that we have too much immigration,” says economist Rob Atkinson, president of tech policy think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The most likely outcome, in Atkinson’s eyes, is that H-1B visas “will be restricted, limited, and harder-to-get” and that tech companies will “have to go through more hoops to prove there’s not an American that can get the job.” Already, Silicon Valley’s largest immigration lobbying group, the Zuckerberg-backed FWD.us, is mobilizing to prevent a rollback or freeze on reform. “Our team at FWD.us — made up of Republicans and Democrats, native-born Americans and immigrants alike — remains fully dedicated to an America that values immigrants,” reads a statement put out yesterday. The group cites exit poll data indicating 71 percent of Americans support a pathway to citizenship. Technology stocks are down across the board since Trump won the election Yet it’s clear FWD.us is concerned. President Todd Schulte followed up the initial statement with a second plea to “stand up for your beliefs, stand with the communities who need you right now, stand for those who can’t stand for themselves and remember that a lot of people don’t have the option to walk away from this fight.” It’s not just the lobbying groups, but investors as well that fear a Trump presidency may adversely affect the industry. Technology stocks are down across the board this week for some of the biggest companies on the planet, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook. The urgency comes from the uncertainties of a Trump administration, but also the personal stakes. The CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, is an immigrant. As are Google co-founder Sergey Brin and Microsoft chief Satya Nadella. The entire Silicon Valley philosophy rests on the idea of rewarding individuals for hard work, talent, and ingenuity — regardless of race, class, or country of origin. Trump’s vague immigration policy proposals threaten this worldview. In a very material way, they also threaten the workforces of both the juggernauts and startups of the tech industry that use the H-1B and other visa programs to expand talent searches around the globe. Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote an impassioned defense of immigrants and Muslims last December as Trump’s campaign gained steam. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images According to the National Foundation for American Policy, more than half of all US technology startups are founded by immigrants. So without an easy path toward citizenship, or in the face of a clamping down on foreign work visas, Silicon Valley faces to lose more than just its lobbying goals in Washington. It could begin to see its influence in all sectors of modern industry — from entertainment to transportation to finance — wane as foreign workers and startup founders are denied entry and begin establishing technology centers outside the US. This could have a number of lasting ripple effects as large tech companies start feeling disadvantaged. “A company like Oracle or some of the enterprise software companies, you could see them potentially losing global market share because of this,” Atkinson says. To counter, those companies could look to Canada. “Places like Vancouver, Toronto, even Montreal could be an option for American tech companies,” he adds. Canada could also use this opportunity to court foreign startup founders away from places like Palo Alto. Canada could court startup founders away from places like Palo Alto As it stands today, the H-1B visa is the most widely used system for bringing in high-skilled foreign labor into the US, allowing in and extending the stay of more than 315,000 foreign workers as of 2014. This amount has increased over the years due to country-based exemptions and renewals that extend the total approvals far beyond the 85,000 per year cap. H-1B visas last three years, with a three-year extension allowed. Still, Silicon Valley and groups like FWD.us are fighting for a broader expansion and easier path to citizenship to allow foreign workers to remain and stay employed permanently. One such proposal includes granting green cards to any foreign student who graduates from an American university. The overall idea is to urge as many as people as possible to pursue tech jobs in the US. Critics, Trump included, say the program is abused to let companies rely on low-cost labor from cheaper countries. In one high-profile case, Disney laid off hundreds of tech workers last year and replaced them with Indian contractors in the US on H-1Bs. The situation, which got Disney sued by its former employees, has become emblematic of H-1B abuses. As it stands, more than 65 percent of all approved H-1B petitions in 2014 were for computer-related jobs, and 96 percent of all approved petitions were for people with bachelor’s degrees or above. The median salary for H-1B workers was around $75,000 two years ago. However, six out of the top 10 H-1B visa recipients in 2014 were IT-focused companies headquartered in India that focus on selling contracts for temporary employment. Trump has been forced to acknowledge the H-1B’s pros and cons in the past, but his position, like his stance on many topics, has remained slippery. As far back as October of 2015, Trump was challenged by a campaign website statement admonishing US companies for hiring foreign workers, demanding instead that companies “hire from the domestic pool of unemployed.” When asked about the H-1B system by moderator Becky Quick that month, Trump said, “I’m in favor of people coming into this country legally. And you know what? They can have it any way you want. You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want … as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, it’s fine.” This answer contradicted his actual policy proposals, which suggested raising the wage requirements for H-1Bs — to address a criticism that H-1B workers are used primarily as cheap labor — and adding a requirement to seek out domestic candidates prior to hiring foreign workers. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images Later, in March of this year, Trump was asked to clarify his position again by Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly. “I’m changing. We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can’t do it, we’ll get them in,” Trump said. However, after the debate, Trump’s campaign released a statement saying the H-1B program was full of rampant abuse. “The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,” the statement read. “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.” “I will forever end the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program.” Trump appeared to come to rest on the topic in a later Republican debate in March, when he admitted to relying on the H-1B program for his own businesses, but admitting he “shouldn’t be allowed to use it” and adding, “We shouldn’t have it. Very, very bad for workers.” So if anything, Trump’s position on the H-1B program would appear to be pushing against the wishes of Silicon Valley, even if he has exhibited moments of self-doubt or change. What this extreme uncertainty says for the future of Silicon Valley employment is unclear. But Trump’s policy proposals don’t reside on the strongest economic footing. The theory is that if you make it harder to hire foreign workers, tech companies will be forced to both raise wages and look to American talent to fill those roles. Those are workers that, in the eyes of H-1B critics, are either too expensive or not young enough to fit the cynical Silicon Valley mold of young, foreign, and cheap. In practice, it may not actually play out like that. “I believe that dynamic works in truck driving,” Atkinson says. “It’s not hard to become a truck driver. It’s really hard to become a software engineer. You’ve got be, first of all, smart. You’ve got to know a lot about math. That eliminates a lot of people in this country.” And if you raise the price of acquiring talent? “They [tech companies] get their talent elsewhere,” Atkinson adds. “Truck driving is a domestic market for skills. Tech is a global market for skills.” More From The Verge Google will soon ban fake news sites from using its ad network China's right: smartphones are a big reason Trump can't win a trade war Donald Trump is about to control the most powerful surveillance machine in history A Tribe Called Quest’s new album is tear-jerking, essential protest music Watch Dogs 2 is exactly what the original game should have been Predicting Westworld: so it’s Lost Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future WhatsApp opens up video calling to everyone The Walking Dead Redemption Club season 7, episode 4: Service Two-thirds of the world's internet users live under government censorship: report Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio to the Mac This Article has a component height of 36.

Back in April, the European Commission came to the conclusion Google had abused its position as the dominant player in the OS market space to force handset manufacturers to preinstall Google services, which could be seen as a move to lock-out competitors. Google denied the nefarious activities from the outset, unsurprising considering the fine could be as much as $7.4 billion, though the case it put forward today outlines how the team plan to fight the antitrust case. “Android has unleashed a new generation of innovation and inter-platform competition,” said Kent Walker, Google’s General Counsel on the official blog. “By any measure, it is the most open, flexible, and differentiated of the mobile computing platforms. “But open-source platforms are fragile. They survive and grow by balancing the needs of all participants, including users and developers. The Commission’s approach would upset this balance, and send an unintended signal favouring closed over open platforms. “It would mean less innovation, less choice, less competition, and higher prices. That wouldn’t be just a bad outcome for us. It would be a bad outcome for developers, for phone makers and carriers, and, most critically, for consumers. That’s the case we are making to the Commission in our filing.” Google’s reply to the antitrust case falls on four points. Firstly, the European Commission’s claim sit on the idea Android doesn’t compete with Apple’s iOS. The team oppose this claim, and go as far as to state Apple would probably disagree as well. It seems a little bit of a silly point to make from the European Commission considering 89% of respondents from its own research believe Android and Apple compete. Point to Google. Secondly, while competition breeds success Google also believes consistency is an important factor. If developers are to succeed in bringing new applications to market, there does need to be consistency, but standardization across various OS platforms will achieve this. The Google team seem to breeze across this point, pointing out developers are successful because there are only a couple of platforms to choose from. Kind of defeats the point of competition which it claims is so important in the first point. If consistency is the overall objective, why not just make Android a monopoly and do away with competition completely? Point to the European Commission. Next is the focus on preinstalled apps, which the European Commission believes limits competition. Google claims no manufacturer is obliged to preinstall apps on devices, though Telecoms.com does suspect the manufacturers are ‘encouraged’ to do so. Apple and Windows phones also do this, though two wrongs do not make a right, and why is Google bringing Microsoft into the argument? Kind of cruel and rubbing salt into the wounds of the fallen smartphone pretender. Users have the option to remove Google apps and download competitors, and according to the team this is done quite a lot. The European Commission is not on strong footing here, almost every company in the world which sells products and services will preload its own software/apps/features for the user, who can then choose whether to use them or not. The users are adults (mostly) and can make their own decisions, and few will complain the time consuming task of downloading apps on a new phone is taken out of their hands. Point to Google. Finally, distributing products like Google Search together with Google Play permits the team to offer the entire suite for free. Sounds very nice, but ultimately Google will make a huge amount of cash off the back of the usage as well. This does smell a little bit of anti-competition as Google does make out like bandits with the added on services or advertising revenues etc. The internet giant is a giant for a reason, but it does remove costs for the user. Draw. Google is seemingly a victim of its own success here, though the European Commission does make a few good points. Ultimately with the toing and froing with appeals, counter-appeals and negotiations, this case is likely to go on for some time, but some in the industry might be happy to see Google isn’t getting everything its own way.

Aims to Help Journalists Write Better News Stories Written by Ben Sullivan Staff Writer, UK November 11, 2016 // 07:25 AM EST Copy This URL The web has distorted journalism, for better and for worse. Global events are covered instantaneously by multiple news agencies. Citizen journalists rush to promote news on social media. But the drive for constant content to make ends meet for publishers has also borne the rise of “churnalism”, and demolished the traditional media ecosystem. Clickbait, in particular, has had an undoubtedly negative effect on readers—the very people that journalists promise to set out to inform—by dishing up endlessly repackaged press releases that retain their PR distortions and untruths. And you only have to look to the US presidential elections to see the impact the constant obsession for reaction pieces and statistical exclusives has had on disorientated readers. But to try and curb this downward spiral of content, one group of researchers has turned to artificial intelligence—with the help of Google. Read more: Early Efforts to Bring the News Online Changed the Shape of Media Forever Neil Maiden, professor of digital creativity at UK’s Cass Business School, is part of a team in London that is building this tool. The idea is to help journalists create more unique, higher-quality articles by using the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to suggest additional information for journalists to add to their work. But while AI is already writing news stories, can it help journalists build better stories? The project that Maiden is heading up is called JUICE, and is funded by Google’s Digital News Initiative to help journalists “discover and explore new creative angles on stories they write”. A collaboration between Cass Business School and the Department of Journalism at City, University of London, JUICE’s core product is an add-on to Google Docs that uses AI systems such as language processing, web searches, and recommendation algorithms to help journalists write their stories. "Our intention is to support journalists very discreetly in the work that they do,” Maiden told Motherboard. “As you're writing a story you can, with a click of a button, ask [JUICE] to invoke different ways of offering you creative and productive advice about the ways in which you can take your story in valuable directions.” "Our intention is to support journalists very discreetly in the work that they do" The main engine of the JUICE tool is access to 470 news sites. Whenever a journalist types something actionable into the document, such as the name of a newsworthy figure or a subject, the AI automatically performs “creative searches” on these websites and pulls up relevant articles, cartoons, and other multimedia that can be included in the story. “If the user asked for X we will generate a query which is X + Y + Z, where Y + Z are things the journalist didn't know they might be interested in,” said Maiden. “The essence of the tool is six strategies,” he added. “We worked with experienced journalists and asked them how they would elaborate or develop angles or spin a story in a particular way to make it interesting, unique, and relevant. Each of the strategies is implemented automatically. The app can take what's been typed already and process it and generate different kind of searches.” Image: Spencer E Holtaway/Flickr The six strategies identified were: individuals, causal, quirky, quantifiable elements, ramifications, and data visualisations. For example, with ‘ramifications’, the AI may help the journalist creatively explore information about the consequences of events and actions related to a news story in order to generate new and useful stories about future consequences. The ‘quirky’ search strategy sifts through a digital database of 30,000 political cartoons so the journalist can take the underlying themes or comedy of them to seek inspiration, Maiden explained. The tool exists to help journalists, but a byproduct would hopefully be higher quality journalism. Maiden said that the tool had proven successful in training student journalists how to create more unique stories when it was trialed at City University. “Before we took the earlier versions of the tool into professional working newsrooms, we thought we'd test it on the students. One of the first things that the staffed realised is actually this can first of all train journalists more quickly. The tool is enacting how experienced journalists work,” said Maiden. “Hopefully, if the tool works effectively, it's pulling out interesting sources so you're getting more value, novelty, and surprise.” The tool is still in development, and Motherboard hopes to get access to JUICE early next year.

Google: Windows Phone and iOS Are More Bloated than Android GO Google compares Android to rival OSes in antitrust probe Nov 11, 2016 13:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Google has its own antitrust problems in Europe, where the Commission is looking into the way the company is pushing Android to phone manufacturers, but the search giant took to its official blog to defend itself with a super long post. And GIFs. And comparisons with other platforms. One of the most interesting statements brought forward by Google in this post claims that Android is not in any way violating antitrust laws because the operating system “hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it.” Google also included a GIF which clearly states that if Android infringes competition rules, then iOS and Windows Phone do the same thing too because they actually come with more pre-installed apps than its operating system. For example, Google says, every new iPhone comes with 39 pre-installed apps, out of which all 39 belong to Apple. At the same time, Lumia 550, which runs Microsoft’s Windows, comes with 47 apps in Europe and 39 of them are developed by Microsoft. On the other hand, on the Samsung Galaxy S7, there are only 11 Google apps, even though the phone ships with 38 pre-installed items. “Many pre-installed apps don’t succeed, and many have been extremely successful through user downloads - think of Spotify or Snapchat. Our apps suite approach explicitly preserves users’ freedom to choose the apps they want on their phones,” Google says. iOS and Windows Phone giving users less choice But this has almost nothing to do with what the Commission says. Instead, the European Commission criticized Google for forcing Android phone manufacturers to pre-install its apps on devices if they want the Google Play Store to be available on their devices. And since the Google Play Store is an essential part of any Android phone, most device makers agree with it, hence the majority of smartphones and tablets come with Google apps. The search giant, however, doesn’t care about this and claims that iOS and Windows Phone are even worse because users have “much less choice in the apps that come with their phones.” “A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no ‘foreclosure,’” the company explained. Of course, the whole dispute in this case is not going to stop here, but it’s interesting to see Google pointing to rivals when trying to defend its own products. And what’s also important to note is that Google calls Windows Phone “a rival,” even though the company has until now expressed zero interest in this platform. #Google#Android#iOS#Windows Phone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile First Impressions More Bad News for Windows Phone As Sales Share Keeps Going Down Windows Phone Will Get Two-Factor Authentication in WhatsApp Microsoft Office Android Apps Suddenly Blocked on Some Chromebooks Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    Google says Windows phones have more pre-installed apps than Androids new android apps Ingress APK: Updated November 15th, 14:19 GMT Facebook Messenger APK: Updated November 15th, 14:16 GMT Inbox by Gmail APK: Updated November 15th, 14:10 GMT Box APK: Updated November 15th, 14:05 GMT Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile APK: Updated November 15th, 13:59 GMT Xbox 360 SmartGlass APK: Updated November 15th, 13:53 GMT My Apps APK: Updated November 15th, 13:47 GMT Reader comments The New Microsoft Is Playing Dirty like the Old Microsoft, Says Salesforce CEO more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

We don’t typically see that company’s wares added to Google’s online storefront, so it’s a bit of a first for both companies. To be specific, Google is pushing OtterBox’s Defender series cases for both the Pixel and Pixel XL. The $50 ($60 for XL users) case adds a great deal of bulk to the phones, but what you’re getting is a tank of an enclosure for your device to ensure it doesn’t shatter when or if you ever drop it. OtterBox defender cases offer 3 layers of protection: A built-in screen protector to protect the display. A soft inner shell with foam lining to absorb shock from drops. A hard outer shell to keep everything airtight. The cases also feature a detachable holster clip if you don’t want to attach it to your belt like the hipsters in the 90s did. You can even remove or replace the screen protector if you prefer your own. Some people may consider OtterBox Defender cases to be a bit much, but if you absolutely feel like you need a thick layer of protection (those with phone-loving kids might want to apply) then this is one of the best options out there. You can buy it straight from Google, or get it through Amazon, OtterBox, and even Verizon if you prefer. local_offer    Google  Google Pixel  Google Pixel XL  Otterbox   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (11) stars Further Reading Free Daydream Views now available Pixel cases may cause camera issues DIY: Use Puffy Paint to protect the back of your Google Pixel Google Play Music gets smart redesign Project ARA Q&A stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Skibbereen native Marie Davis, head of Google Marketing Solutions Ireland, at the Google Garage in The Southern Star’s historic Lady’s Well Brewery building. THE Southern Star is proud to be hosting Google in one of Skibbereen’s historic buildings during the upcoming National Digital Week. The Google ‘Digital Garage’ programme is an initiative to help Irish businesses attending the event learn crucial skills for the digital age and harness the power of the internet to reach more customers and grow faster. The garage will be run by Google Ireland digital experts all day on Friday November 11th and Saturday November 12th in the Southern Star’s historic Lady’s Well Brewery building in Skibbereen, at the rear of its premises on Ilen Street.  The most recent IEDR dot ie Digital Health Index, which measures the health of Irish SMEs’ digital presence by analysing the number of digital assets (like websites, apps and social media accounts) owned by them and their perceived quality, found that 17% of Irish SMEs still have no digital assets and 55% of these don’t intend on building a website in the near future.  Marie Davis, head of the Google marketing solutions team in Ireland, said it’s really important that small businesses here can compete in the digital age. ‘Google in Ireland is a proven growth engine for small business. We believe that giving small business owners access to expert advice will help to strengthen Ireland’s reputation as the digital hub of Europe,’ she said.    ‘At National Digital Week we will provide one-to-one business clinics tailored to all levels of digital know-how to show Irish businesses how they can get their business online,’ she added. ‘For businesses already online we will show them how to sell online, reach more people on social media and get their business noticed so they can grow and expand. There will also be an opportunity for attendees to hear from other digital garage participants on how digital has made a difference to their businesses and lives.’ Morgan O’Driscoll, who runs his online Irish Art Auction House, based in Skibbereen since 1994, took his business online in 2011 after realising he needed to realise the potential of the internet as a marketing tool, his business was the first in Ireland to hold online auctions, as well as live stream in-room auctions.   ‘Before the internet our bidders were almost all based in Ireland. However, since incorporating an online business model we have sold to bidders in over 40 different countries including Argentina, Chile, Ghana, Russia, Dubai, France and the UK,’ he said. Since 2011 O’Driscoll has seen his sales revenue grow tenfold. ‘The value in learning how to do things for yourself is immense, even if you decide to outsource your digital strategy to external experts or hire in-house expertise, it’s still really important that you know and understand for yourself what is possible, how to measure your success and see new opportunities for growth.’ The Digital Garage is open to anyone interested in learning or furthering their digital skills.

Google’s primary revenue source is ads, and its approach is to fix what’s wrong with ads instead of putting them off the table entirely by building an ad-blocker into Chrome, something the likes of Opera have done in the past. CNET interviewed Darin Fisher, VP of Chrome Engineering who said, “We feel like there are a lot of challenges in advertising. There are a lot of wrong ways. If publishers and advertisers do ads the right way, it can be great for the users and for the ecosystem”. There has been a constant battle between the pro-user experience camp that wants to avoid ads or tracking mechanisms because they’re too intrusive and resource-consuming, and websites blocking such users because ads are the primary revenue for many. In August this year, there started a cat-and-mouse game between Facebook and popular ad-blocking service AdBlock Plus, where the latter would allow blocking of ads on Facebook, only for that service to rendered useless soon after.It’s not just ad-blocking apps, some browsers themselves have moved to the offensive by offering such built-in features. Opera unveiled such a feature May this year, while Samsung built an ad-blocker into its own browse. Apple too introduced a mechanism for third-party apps to block ads and other content in iOS 9 the year before. Google has also tried to restrain the rise of content blocking Android apps, by revamping developer guidelines that explicitly say that “apps that block or interfere with other another app displaying ads” is a violation of the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement. Also, ad-blocking services have come under fire too, for allowing certain ads to pass through, for the sake of making revenues themselves. AdBlock Plus unveiled an ‘Acceptable Ads’ platform that sells and serves ads to its users. Popular iOS content blocker app Crystal also let certain ads pass through for paying publishers. Google is taking initiative to improve ads with efforts like the Coalition for Better Ads, which includes other big names like Facebook. Considering many of the world’s businesses are running due to online advertisements, the concern of consumers using ad-blocking services is graver than ever.

Meaning, if they drop looking at links for ranking purposes, the quality of the search results that Google can return drop significantly. Gary Illyes repeated that message in the past year. Dawn Anderson this morning ask Gary Illyes from Google if he was referring to external links or internal links. External links are links you get from third-party web sites, internal links are links you control within your site. Gary said he was referring to external links. He said on Twitter, "I was referring to external ones. Those links translate in some sense to popularity and endorsement by others." So the internal links don't translate to "popularity and endorsement," because they are internal. Here are the tweets: @dawnieando I was referring to external ones.

Gary is just saying that without the external links they can not get correct results, not that they are not using the internal links to rank Nick Ker 11/11/2016 04:27 pm Please explain why you think links on your own site, pointing to other pages on your site, translate to popularity and endorsement. Gary was specifically talking about external links. Anon User 11/11/2016 05:27 pm Is there such a thing as a link that can't be built manually? Even Xrumer has to have someone plug in some shit manually at the start. Ethan Glover 11/11/2016 06:40 pm Without using external linking as a factor I think it's obvious you're going to get bad search results. Quality referrals and sourcing mean a lot. The tricky part is getting people to not think about getting links when building their content and instead focusing on quality. If there were a smart way for Google to determine quality without using backlinks, I'm positive they would ditch them.

David S Freid 11/13/2016 01:12 am Right down to the content... Think wise! 11/13/2016 08:55 am I have a website with no external links used and I get 3-5K visitors per day. Most of the "links" are nofollowed shares from social media. Nothing else. The majority of the traffic is from Google. I don't believe in links anymore. I don't have anyone to tell me which is right or wrong as I am seeing it from my own work. Ron Smith 11/14/2016 05:33 am Yes, external links are important for results... srinivasrjy 11/14/2016 08:32 am I google supports external links, it will create a misleading atmosphere in web space. A professor's blog with good content can not sit to build external links. Rotimi Fafure 11/14/2016 10:39 am Rankings are not important to content developers alone. If we follow Google's organizational philosophy this days (though not any drastic change from the founding), it has always maintained its stand for humanity; online searchers, publishers, even Alphabet at the top. We are important to each other's welfare. Google does external links too when required. I will want to think that if we all do what is expected of us by way of recommended best practices, the rest should be left to #SundaiPichai who knows what to do regarding ranking through links (internal & external in search results because he is driven by the concept of digital marketing with human face however best it can. Google has carried on the difficult task of maintaining the world's information database well and has not shown any sign of slowing down.

Like the Gear and other phone-powered virtual reality headsets, the View connects to your smartphone for VR experiences (although it's only compatible with the Pixel and Pixel XL right now). In our review we found it was a cut above the competition — easy-to-use and comfortable. If you're curious about the View, Google has shared a bunch of retailers where it's available to buy, and hopefully some of those will also have units in store for customers to try first: United States: Google Store, Verizon, Best Buy; $79 (USD) Canada: Google Store, Bell, Rogers, Telus, Best Buy; $99 (CAD) United Kingdom: Google Store, EE, Carphone Warehouse; £69 (GBP) Germany: Google Store, Deutsche Telekom; €69 (EUR) Australia: Google Store, JB Hi-Fi; $119 (AUD); Coming to Telstra on Nov 22nd As well as the headset itself, Google has also launched its own Android-only VR platform: Daydream. This includes access to VR-versions of popular Google apps including Google Photos, Google Movies, Google Arts & Culture, and — the killer app — YouTube VR. Cheaper headsets like the View are never going to compete with the likes of the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift in terms of graphics and immersive features like head-tracking, but they’re bringing VR mainstream.

Daily Google Crawl Data Report For Apps Now Updated Every Few Days Vs. Daily Nov 11, 2016 • 7:15 am | (0) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next Story Google has quietly posted on their data anomalies page that they have changed how often they update the "Crawl Status" report in the Google Search Console specifically for apps. They went from updating the data on a daily basis to updating it every 3-4 days in batches. It was always a couple days behind, but the data would be updated daily with the information from a few days ahead. Now, you will only see data updated in batches, with 3-4 days of data being added at a time. Why? Google said this is to "improve system performance." Here is the full quote: (Apps only) Crawl data for apps will be updated every 3-4 days, rather than daily, in order to improve system performance.

It’s not new camera features; many would argue that’s not necessary anyway. It’s also now a new processor, though we’re entirely sure that’s coming as well. Next time, it’ll be all about partnerships and how much time Google has to focus in on how to build what could be the best phone ever, hands down. HTC, Google and Huawei After the Pixel was announced, a bit of news surfaced about how it actually came to be. It probably wasn’t as linear as you’d think, either. Originally Google tapped Huawei to make the Pixel. It had done such a bang-up job with the 6P (my favorite Nexus phone by far) that Google wanted to work with them again. Unfortunately, Huawei wasn’t into it. The reason? Google didn’t want any manufacturer branding on the device. It barely has Google’s mark! With that hard ‘no’ on the table, Google turned to HTC, who gleefully took the task of making the Pixel. The rest is a bit of history. HTC has no shame Here’s a brief snippet on the two different types of manufacturers for smartphones: OEM and ODM. An OEM is an ‘original equipment manufacturer.’ Those are the Samsungs and LGs of the world; they control their own supply chain, have their own tooling equipment and basically run their own show. An ODM is an ‘original design manufacturer,’ and is a bit trickier to nail down. The most notable ODM around is Foxconn, which handles a lot of Apple’s iPhone supply chain. The ODM will make phones to someone else’s specs. HTC started life as an ODM. Before it made waves with the HTC Evo 4G with Sprint, HTC was doing a lot of ODM work for other companies. If you ever had a Palm Treo 650, you had an HTC. Between HTC’s origin story and it’s current status as an OEM that’s falling victim to Samsung, taking on the Pixel was no problem. Google was dead set on controlling every aspect of the Pixel anyway, so it was either source its own supply chain (tedious and tenuous), or find an established entity to handle it. Google chose wisely. Nine months Google and HTC only had nine months to work on getting the Pixel manufactured. That sounds like a long time, but when you’re taking about mass production of a device that has a lot of intricate parts that will be heavily scrutinized by the press and customers who’ve plopped down hundreds of dollars for one, there’s not a lot of wiggle room. Huawei was undoubtedly critical to the early stages of planning the Pixel, but with it being unwilling to follow through — Google was in a tough spot. And really, nine months — even when you have a pretty good idea of what you want to do with your phone — is not a long time to work with your partner. But HTC and Google got the Pixel out, and it’s easily the best Android handset available. Some even say the best phone, period; high praise indeed. Now that Google has found a willing dance partner in HTC, it’s reasonable to believe planning for the Pixel 2 has already begun. And with so much extra time, who knows how good the second Pixel will end up. In nine months, Google and HTC made an iPhone-beater. Given a full year, the two companies may be able to show us what the perfect piece of smartphone hardware really looks like.

Now that Chromebooks are starting to get access to Android apps, those same restrictions will apply for Google's laptops. Just like the iPad Pro, Chromebooks with a screen larger than 10.1 inches will not be able to access Microsoft Office editing free of charge. This restriction includes most Chromebooks on the market, and it's only devices like ASUS' Chromebook Flip (10.1-inch display) that will be able to use Microsoft Office free of charge. "Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability," explains a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to 9to5Google. "On devices larger than 10.1 inches, an Office 365 subscription is required to unlock the ability to create, edit, or print documents." This isn't a new strategy or policy, and Microsoft isn't unfairly targeting Chromebooks. The software giant revealed last year that it would classify a machine with a 10.1-inch display or below as a "true mobile device." Microsoft applied the same rules to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, while the smaller iPad Pro still retains free access to Microsoft Office. Microsoft currently offers individual Office 365 Personal subscriptions for $6.99 per month, or $69.99 a year.

Home Industry Tech iOS 10 vs Android Nougat 7.0: How Google is building on what Apple started iOS 10 vs Android Nougat 7.0: How Google is building on what Apple started iOS 10 vs Nougat 7.0: In the battle of operating systems, Google seems to be taking small steps to win the war. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: November 11, 2016 5:28 PM iOS 10 vs Android Nougat 7.0: Google is leaving no stone unturned to take up Apple’s innovations and take it further, one step at a time. (Source: Reuters) iOS 10 vs Nougat 7.0: In the battle of operating systems, Google seems to be taking small steps to win the war. It is leaving no stone unturned to take up Apple’s innovations and take it further, one step at a time. And undoubtedly, these steps are bearing fruits as the popularity of Android keeps on increasing each month. According to reports almost 9 out of 10 smartphones in the world have Android, while the rest are divided between Apple iOS, Blackberry, and Windows. The Apple iOS 10 was launched after the unveiling of Apple iPhone 7 lineup. Google rolled out the Android Nougat 7.0 to the Nexus series and then the brand new flagship Google Pixel series. There have been a number of debates on which OS is better. Here is a comparison: User Interface and notifications: Both iOS and Android have long been trying to reach various aspects of each other when it comes to user interface. They have been vying to achieve similar aesthetics of design as that of the other. For starters, this year Android has redesigned its user interface, and the most notable feature is its minimalistic borders. The icons occupy the width of the screen along with smaller fonts. It will be safe to say the Android looks more like iOS this year. iOS too is not far behind, by using the 3D Touch and implementing widgets to the home screen, it has tried to go the Android way here as well. Operating system updates: Android has long been untethered from its stock applications and has been implementing the updates faster than iOS. This helps because Google doesn’t have to update every default apps each time the main OS is updated, which makes it quicker. But now iOS has made it possible to delete the stock apps, and it may help Apple to push in faster updates. Stock applications and Delete Now, its is possible in both iOS 10 and Nougat to delete stock apps. But what the feature does is, it just hides the app instead of deleting it from the device, and that too not all. Photo app iOS 10 now offers a feature which Google has been providing to its users for a year. It uses machine learning and identifies places and people in the image and users can use it to search as well. Like, if one searches for ‘mountains’ the app with automatically return with images features mountains. The app also creates slideshows with the user’s best images. Hence when it comes to this feature, both of them are going neck to neck. Music applications: Although Apple has revamped its Music app in iOS 10 with a more simplified navigation and user interface, yet Android has better options. While Apple offers a good streaming option, Google goes one up for its music fans by giving an app which along with streaming also allows the user to store and play music. Also read | OnePlus One & OnePlus 2 to get Android Nougat 7.0, 7.1 Personal assistants Siri and Google Now: According to reports, Apple has massively improved upon its virtual personal assistant Siri. Siri has better features, and although late, has allowed developers all over the world to provide suggestions with an aim to improve the build. It will be a tough task to compete with Google’s algorithms, in its Google Now, yet the competition can get interesting. Verdict: With the launch of several new high-end smartphones including tech giants like Apple and Samsung, the virtual war has reached very interesting times. Apple and Google’s major operating systems – Android and iOS are fighting it out as well. It is interesting to note that both the platforms have borrowed features from each other and are eventually becoming more similar than ever before. Apart from the platform’s fragmented nature, the update cycles look to be a bit problematic for most parts of the Android Nougat, added with the fact that often only new handsets can receive the updates leaving out most old phones. The problem occurs as the Google’s platform is used by other manufacturers, and they in order to sell new hardware neglect the previous versions of smartphones in a vast majority. Consumers generally have to update their hardware each year. Apple, with its top-down management, has complete control of both its hardware and software. The adoption of latest iOS is very high as the updates are available as soon as it arrives in the market. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Mountain View's latest offering was smashed by white-hat friendlies from Qihoo 360, who used an undisclosed vulnerability to gain remote code execution for $120,000 cash prize. The exploit launched the Google Play store before opening Chrome and displaying a web page reading "Pwned By 360 Alpha Team". Google said the Chrome bug that Keen Team found was patched within 24 hours of the event and the changes have already been released into the stable branch by the Chrome team. It was the second time in as many weeks that the Pixel has been compromised. The Pixel, pwned The first still-unpatched zero day was developed by Qihoo 360 rival Keen Team of Tencent at the Mobile Pwn2Own event in Japan. Hackers there showcased the exploit at the PwnFest hacking event in Seoul today showing how they could compromise all aspects of the phone including contacts, photos, messages, and phone calls.

Qihoo 360 also breached Adobe Flash with a flick of the finger, digging up a combination decade-old, use-after-free zero day and a win32k kernel flaw to score $120,000. It took four seconds for Flash to fall. The hacks conclude the PwnFest whitewash, which saw Microsoft Edge hacked and the first-ever zero day exploits against VMWare Workstation on Thursday. Qihoo 360 hackers walked away with $520,000 in prize money. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 72 Comments More from The Register Three LibTIFF bugs found, only two patched Buffer overruns, remote code execution, you know the drill 8 Comments Virtual reality is actually made of smartphones From the HoloLens to the PlayStation VR, all VR kit is descended from the first iPhone 49 Comments Spain's iPhone killer actually a rebranded Xiaomi – new claim Zetta handsets might have been marked-up Chinese phones 26 Comments Stingy sapphire lens in Apple's iPhone 7 is as scratchy as glass Campaign for Real Minerals, queue here 32 Comments Masked men 'steal' £250k of smartphones from Exertis 170 iPhone 6s and 380 Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo mobes out the windows 15 Comments Analyst: iPhone 7 points to price jump It is all in the numbers 30 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Users who visit Google's homepage will be treated to the colorful artwork that depicts a group of men and women who served in the Armed Forces as they march down a street amongst a cheering crowd and patriotic confetti. "The artwork for today's doodle was created by Doodler Olivia Huynh in collaboration with myself and the network of veterans at Google," noted Doodler Diana Tran who served in the Marine Corps. "She's done a wonderful job of capturing the celebratory and inclusive nature of Veterans Day. Today, I hope you'll join us in honoring our veterans who sacrificed so that we can enjoy our freedom," she continued. "To all veterans everywhere, thank you for your service." Veterans Day, originally titled Armistice Day, was first created to celebrate the end of World War I. It was made a legal holiday in 1954 and was given a new name to be more inclusive for all veterans who have served.

While Google itself has been using USB Power Delivery protocol since last year to provide fast charging on its devices, most Android devices rely on Qualcomm's Quick Charge, while others have come up with their own version, such as the DASH charging on the OnePlus 3. Unfortunately, both of these are proprietary solutions and require a specific piece of hardware on the device/charger/cable, licensing, as well as messing around with the standard USB power delivery protocols. It also makes them incompatible with desktop or notebook computers that have USB PD charging and thus makes them charge slowly. Google doesn't seem too keen on this, which is why the company has added the following in the Android 7.0 Compatibility Definition, that all OEMs have to adhere to if they want access to Google's proprietary apps. Type-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as "STRONGLY RECOMMENDED", in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers. Why is this important? Think of it this way, in future you can just carry one charger for your laptop and your smartphone or any other device you might have. All of them will connect with USB-C and because they all support USB Power Deliver they will all fast charge from the same charger. This is really the point of having a unified interface such as USB-C and as long as manufacturers keep using proprietary solutions that only work with that particular device this future will forever remain a dream.

Google lawyer says Android helps rather than harms competition Reuters 4 days ago By Foo Yun Chee © REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo A Google search page is reflected in sunglasses in this photo illustration taken in Brussels Google's Android mobile operating system boosts competition rather than hurts it, the company's general counsel said on Thursday, in a rebuttal of EU antitrust charges that it uses the platform to crush rivals. The comments by Google general counsel Kent Walker on a blog came a week after the U.S. technology group rejected two other EU accusations of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking competitors in online search advertising. The Android case could potentially be the most damaging for Google. Android has made about $31 billion in revenue and $22 billion in profit for Google since its release in 2008, an Oracle Corp lawyer told a U.S. court in January. Android's market share in Europe is above 90 percent, according to the European Commission. Walker said the Commission has got the whole case wrong, ignoring both the fierce rivalry with iPhone maker Apple, the demands from apps developers and the dangers of modified versions of Android. "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn’t hurt competition, it's expanded it," he said. The case is distorted because the EU competition enforcer does not see Apple's iOS as a rival to Android, he said. "To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today's competitive smartphone landscape," Walker said. The company said it bundles some of its apps and products in order to offer the package for free instead of charging upfront licensing fees. Such a practice put Microsoft in the EU crosshairs, eventually resulting in millions of euros of fines for the U.S. software company. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso confirmed receipt of Google's response. Lobbying group and complainant FairSearch, whose members include U.S. travel sites Expedia and TripAdvisor, dismissed Google's arguments. "The truth is that Android is today a closed operating system, and any claim to the contrary is disingenuous. Google imposes severe sanctions on those who defy its insistence on conformity," FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said in a statement. The EU antitrust enforcer intends to hit the company with deterrent fines in the Android and shopping cases, according to charge sheets seen by Reuters. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion, or 10 percent of Google's global turnover, for each case if it is found guilty of breaching EU rules.

And now at the Chrome Dev Summit that it currently taking place at San Francisco, Chrome Engineering VP Darin Fisher has revealed that currently 2 billion Chrome installs are in active use across desktops and mobiles. This information was revealed in a keynote delivered by Chrome Engineering VP Darin Fisher. According to a Tech Crunch report, Google, however, didn’t reveal how many people are currently using chrome. “I wanted to make this point that there are a lot of Chrome browsers out there. What’s exciting about this to you all is that when you think about building for the web, there’ a lot of browsers out there that implement the latest web standards — that implement the latest and greatest web features,” the report quotes Fisher as saying. In April this year, Google came out with a blogpost where it had revealed that Chrome had crossed 1 billion monthly mobile users. Besides this, the post had also informed that 771 billion pages load each month, which is pretty much same the number of pages in over 821 million dictionaries. It was also showcased that Chrome helps users with the option to search autocomplete, which saves one from 18,6528 years of typing for users. As of October 2016, StatCounter estimates that Google Chrome has a 63% worldwide usage share of web browsers as a desktop browser. Its success has led to Google expanding the "Chrome" brand name on various other products such as Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox and Chromebase.

However Amazon wasn’t quite as restrictive and opened Alexa up to other companies, resulting in a variety of gadgets and software being created that takes advantage of it. We saw Apple quickly hop on board with the idea of opening Siri up to third-party developers, and now it looks like Google will do the same with Google Assistant. The company has recently announced that Actions on Google will be open to developers starting next month. For non-developers, basically this means that you can look forward to other apps and services and even hardware that will be able to leverage Google Assistant as its AI of choice. At the moment we’re not sure who will be taking advantage of the SDK and embedding Google Assistant into their products, but it does sound like it has a lot of potential. As it stands, Google Assistant exists as an exclusive feature for their Pixel phones, but by opening it up to other developers we’ll be able to see the feature shine more, plus it will help Google catchup to Amazon who has had a pretty decent head start with Alexa. In the meantime we guess we’ll just have to wait and see what kind of products and services we can expect from this. Filed in General. Read more about Google and google assistant.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Real-Life Photos Of Project Ara And Specs Revealed By Tyler Lee on 11/11/2016 02:46 PST After what felt like years of Google promising to make Project Ara a commercial reality, the rug was pulled out from under us a couple of months ago when Google confirmed that work on Project Ara had been suspended. We’re still not 100% sure why that is the case as Google is still remaining mum on that topic, but either way that’s pretty much the end of that. However for those wondering what we could have expected, you’ll be pleased to learn that the folks at Phandroid have managed to get their hands on a Project Ara device and have uploaded a bunch of photos of what the phone looks like in real life, as well as share some of the specs that we could have come to expect. Now right off the bat it is clear that Project Ara’s focus is definitely not on thinness as the phone is by no means thin compared to other devices out there. However despite that we have to say that it looks pretty good. The modules connect via a magnet that sticks out at a 90-degree angle so that they stay securely in place when attached. As for the specs, the model they had was powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chipset with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It also came with a 5.46-inch Full HD display with a 3,450mAh battery. Note that these aren’t exactly the most powerful specs, although we can’t say for sure if these would have been the final specs ahead of its release. Either way it is a pity that the phone will not be released for now. Note that Google confirmed that they had suspended their plans, meaning there’s a chance it could be revived in the future. However given the lack of success we’re seeing from other modular phones like the LG G5 and Moto Z, maybe not launching Project Ara commercially wasn’t such a bad idea after all. Filed in Cellphones.

"Our mission is to move the web platform forward," said Darin Fisher, VP of Chrome engineering, at the Chrome Developers Summit. It would be another hour or so before a video acknowledged what most developers have known for years, that the web platform buckled under the weight of premature enthusiasm and ever bloating ad pages: "Let's face it, until now the alternative to native apps hasn't been great." Back in 2009, Google declared that the web had won, optimism as shoddy as recent election projections. Not long after that, it became clear that native apps offered a better experience on mobile devices than web apps. Facebook touched on the issue in a 2012 post that describes the company's rationale for shifting its development focus from web apps to native apps. It wasn't quite the repudiation of web technology that many took it to be – Facebook said it would continue to use HTML to allow it to update its app without requiring a repeat download – but it affirmed that web technology needs further attention. To frame the issue in numbers, a recent study from Google's DoubleClick advertising arm found that the average load time for mobile sites over 3G is 19 seconds. It also found that 53 per cent of visits to mobile sites are abandoned after 3 seconds. Moving the web platform forward mostly means making mobile web apps lightning fast. "You leave real money on the table when your app is slow," said Google software engineer Alex Russell. Russell went on to claim that pretty much every JavaScript framework falls short for mobile web apps running under the network conditions found in most of the world. "Today's frameworks are mostly a sign of ignorance or privilege or both," he said. There have been efforts to address page load performance, in the form of Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and Facebook Instant Articles. Where AMP and Instant Articles focus on getting content to users faster, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have more to do with engagement, through parity with native app expectations. PWAs were proposed last year by designer Frances Berriman and Russell as an attempt to help web technology compete with native code. PWAs would be responsive, network-independent, and discoverable as applications in search. They would observe app-oriented navigation and interaction conventions. And they would be always up-to-date, safe, installable, and linkable. PWAs are about behavior rather than APIs. Google has a checklist that describes the way PWAs should work. Making a compliant PWA may involve technologies like service workers, which cache content so the app isn't network-dependent. But developers could equally well write a custom caching routine, were they so inclined. Similarly, developers might choose to use the Credential Management API introduced at Google I/O earlier this year, because it makes authentication easier. But other approaches work too. "Progressive web apps are not just about any one technology or any set of technologies," said Fisher. "It's more about a new way of thinking about building web experiences." It appears to be a good time to be having such thoughts. Native mobile apps have lost their luster, apart from those backed by the marketing muscle of companies at the intersection of social and mobile communication, like Facebook. As some tech pundits like to say: "The app boom is over." Perhaps more meaningful than the overabundance of apps among smartphone users in the US and Europe is the situation in emerging markets. Elsewhere in the world, where network conditions are often constrained – 60 per cent of mobile traffic travels over 2G connections, according to Fisher – and downloading hefty native apps isn't practical, companies like Flipkart have been early adopters of emerging web technology because there isn't a better alternative. Thao Tran, head of global product partnerships for Chrome and the web platform, cited the case of Housing.com, an Indian real estate website. The cost for the company to acquire a user for its Android app is about $3.75, Tran said. The cost to acquire a user through via the mobile web is about $0.07. Tran also recounted how Lyft recently rolled out a web app and ended up receiving five times more ride requests than expected. She said Lyft's goal is to have feature parity between its native and web apps. In markets where downloading native apps weighing in at 17MB and 75MB respectively might prove prohibitive, a web app of less than 1MB could entice new customers. The appeal of the web is its vast reach, and much the web is seen through Chrome. Fisher said there are now over two billion active Chrome browsers across mobile and desktop devices, reach that rivals Facebook, albeit without the social data. Even so, Google Chrome should appeal to marketers because, as Google product manager Zach Koch explained, people trust Chrome by letting it remember personal information like credit card numbers and home addresses. Easy access to personal data contributes to the way investors value companies. Apple observers, for example, sometimes cite the number of iTunes accounts as a financial bellwether for the company, based on the notion that spending comes easily when payment information is already on file. Google is in a similar situation with Android. And if it can turn its mobile browser into a shortcut to spending, so much the better for its advertising business. Toward that end, Koch discussed PaymentRequest, a recently introduced payments API for the web. Introduced in July, PaymentRequest is a standards-based API to make it easier to pay for things from the browser. It's not, Koch stressed, a new payment method or an attempt by Google to become payment processor. "Our goal is to help users pay the way they want to pay, and to do it quickly or efficiently," said Koch. In some circles, that counts as moving the web forward. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 13 Comments More from The Register ACCC issues mobile roaming regulation discussion paper Pigeons, meet cat AWS: We're gonna make mobile apps great again with Lambda functions The best apps will come from America, using Amazon, which will be paying all that tax 8 Comments Outage-prone Plusnet goes mobile in a bid to become 'quad-play' biz Hitches ride on BT's EE network – but can they do it better than they do broadband? 3 Comments T-Mobile USA leaked free access to sites with '/speedtest' in the URL High school slacker hacker gets LTE for free 15 Comments Whinge on: T-Mobile US docked $48m for limiting 'unlimited' data plans Telco coughs up cash to make throttling complaints go away 11 Comments EasyJet rides digital and mobile on Brexit currency pressure Incubator partnership unveiled Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

The popular Australian hip-hop trio on Friday (Nov. 11) shared an immersive music video for "Through The Dark," a personal song penned by founding member MC Pressure (real name Dan Smith) on the journey he faced after his son Liam’s cancer diagnosis.   The Hoods joined forces with Google to shed light on Pressure’s tale and help find a way out of the darkness for others facing similar challenges.  “We received literally thousands of emails and interactions from people telling us their story of similar things. And how much the song meant to them and how it connected,” Pressure tells Billboard. “'Through The Dark' has “become a theme as part of their therapy of getting through their journey, and because of that we wanted to do more than just a single. We wanted it to be bigger. And this gave us that window of opportunity to create an amazing immersive experience for all of those people and to have a type of legacy to give back to other kids suffering a chronic illness.” The interactive film has been created for use on Android smartphones and traces a father and son’s travels through two 3D-animated worlds, a dark place representing fear, the light meaning hope. The tech giant’s execs approached the band with the seed of an idea. “It felt like a fit,” explains Google Play’s product marketing manager Sophie Hirst. “If you look at the users on Google Play Music, we knew that our users really love Hilltop Hoods, they really consume a lot of music on our platform. Plus, I’ve always been a big fan of the band.” The song, a fan-favorite at the Hoods' live shows, appeared on the group's 2014 album Walking Under Stars and on the rebooted Drinking From The Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung from February 2016, both of which reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart (the Hilltop Hoods have landed five albums at the top of the national albums chart).   Though Google declined to divulge its cost, both parties workshopped the video project for “many, many months,” Hirst explains. “We were breaking new ground together and that felt exciting for Google and the band. This is a genuine partnership.”  For every fan who listens to Hilltop Hoods’ latest album on Google Play Music via the link at the clip's conclusion, Google and the hip-hoppers have pledged to donate $1 to youth cancer organization CanTeen. The money raised will boost a new project Side of Stage, which will enable young people affected by cancer special access to live music shows across the country. The video is now live and can be viewed at throughthedark.withgoogle.com through high-spec Android mobile devices and desktops.  Hirst hopes the Hilltop Hoods partnership will be the starting point for many other music campaigns. “It was really important for us to support Australian artists. The other thing is we just really love seeing how technology can push art forward. We love building things, we love playing around with technology and seeing how that can be used to innovate creative art, and in particular music. It’s something Google has done for a while and will continue to do.” Pressure has been living in the light for some years now. His son is healthy, Liam's leukemia is a problem of the past. “He’s like any other 12-year-old. He has a crush on a girl at school, he downloads as much rap music as I do. But he’s been living cancer-free for over two years, so that’s great. It’s a really beautiful end.” The Hilltop Hoods are nominated in three categories for the Nov. 23 ARIA Awards.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

The votes will be tallied and either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be elected the next president of the United States. Anyone who has been watching coverage of the election so far may have noticed it is particularly heated, and the drama will likely intensify before things calm down. If you want to keep a close eye on the election night results, you are in luck; in the age of social media, there will be no shortage of charts, maps, and fluctuating think-pieces to obsess over. Here are some of the best resources online for keeping track of the election results. More: Over 20 states’ voter registration systems have been hacked, officials say FiveThirtyEight for predictions Since its launch in 2008, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight has become one of the most respected sources for election coverage. The site focuses on data-driven analysis, compiling polling data from each state, and weighting those polls based on the pollster’s prior accuracy. Its coverage includes straightforward graphics breaking down both the presidential and senate races, and written analysis that delves into current events and how they are impacting the polls. Politico has a real-time results map Politico’s election coverage looks at every election currently happening, including the race for the presidency but also results for the senate, house, and even individual ballot measures. The site includes an interactive map that allows readers to look at each state’s results in real time. Those who want more detailed results can see results for specific counties. Google will give results if you ask it Google will be integrating voting results into Google searches on election day. The company plans to update the results frequently, and there will be tabs so you can switch easily between results for different races, as well as current progress in the electoral college. The search engine also provides detailed information on how to vote, so you can easily find a polling place. YouTube for live coverage In keeping with Google’s push for election coverage, YouTube will host coverage from various news channels. Starting 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, channels such as NBC, PBS, Bloomberg, Telemundo, and more will stream their coverage of the results, so users will have access to a diverse array of views. The NY Times if you want to play with the electoral college One of America’s most venerable publications offers a robust package of electoral information. The site’s forecast focuses on statistics, offering estimates for each state as well as each candidate’s paths to victory. Also of note, The New York Times has made all its content free through November 9, so readers can stay informed. Votecastr Most news sources prefer to wait until polls close before starting to release results, so they do not affect voting patterns by alerting voters to real-time polling results. Votecastr wants to cast aside this tradition, offering exit polling results in real time through news sources such as Vice and Slate. The company is particularly keen to show results from battleground states. Votecastr is staffed by data analysts from President Obama’s 2012 campaign, so there may be a whiff of bias in their agenda, but this still seems like an interesting experiment to follow. Twitter & Buzzfeed For those who enjoy the communal sharing of social media, Buzzfeed will be streaming its coverage on Twitter, starting at 6 p.m. ET. Alongside the video is a feed providing tweets from major news sources, so users will not miss any major happenings. Aside from Buzzfeed’s stream, Twitter users can also simply check out their favorite Twitter accounts. Every major publication will likely have some form of coverage on their Twitter profiles, such as The Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight, Vox, The Associated Press, and more. #Election2016 is one of the main hashtags for election news on Twitter.

However with the public release, the feature was removed. Instead it seemed that only Google’s new Pixel phones had the feature in the form of Night Light. The good news is that Google could be considering bringing the feature back to Nexus handsets. Why is this? When Nexus users found that the feature was removed, some of them took to Google’s Issue Tracker to report the missing feature as a bug/issue. It was launched on the 20th of October but it has since been marked as a Future Release issue to be addressed. This means that this is something that Google will be taking a look at. Whether or not Google will actually go ahead and reintroduce the feature is an entirely different story, but we guess there is a glimmer of hope that they will see how many users want it, and based on that they will bring it back. It has been previously suggested that due to the hardware drivers, the older Nexus handsets were incapable of handling the feature, hence the removal. We’re not sure how true that is but Samsung is already introducing the feature to their own smartphones, so hopefully Google will do the same for their Nexus handsets as well. Filed in Cellphones.

Image: Asif Islam/Shutterstock In the face of a $7.4bn fine, internet giant Google has dismissed the European Commission’s claims that its dominance of the mobile OS market is hurting competition. Google has responded to objections raised by the European Commission (EC) over how it manages Android compatibility and distributes apps. Google said that the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of developers, hardware makers and mobile network operators. “Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it,” said Google senior vice president and general counsel, Kent Walker. ‘The rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices we see in smartphones represent the hallmarks of robust competition’ – KENT WALKER Google launched Android in 2007 as a free, open source operating system. Walker said that because manufacturers don’t have to buy or build expensive operating systems, some Android smartphones can be bought for as little as $45. As a result, globally, Android smartphones represent 87.5pc of all smartphones, compared with 12.1pc of phones that are iOS, according to figures from Strategy Analytics. “Today, more than 24,000 devices from over 1,300 brands run on Android. And European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world. Android is not a ‘one way street’; it’s a multi-lane highway of choice,” Walker said. All is fair in love and competition, says Google Walker said that the EC’s claim that Android and iOS don’t compete is simply not true. “We don’t see it that way. We don’t think Apple does either. Or phone makers. Or developers. Or users. In fact, 89pc of respondents to the Commission’s own market survey confirmed that Android and Apple compete. To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape. “Second, we are concerned that the Commission’s preliminary findings underestimate the importance of developers and the dangers of fragmentation in a mobile ecosystem. “Developers – and there were at least 1.3m of them in Europe in 2015 – depend on a stable and consistent framework to do their work. Any phone maker can download Android and modify it in any way they choose. But that flexibility makes Android vulnerable to fragmentation – a problem that plagued previous operating systems like Unix and Symbian. “When anyone can modify your code, how do you ensure there’s a common, consistent version of the operating system, so that developers don’t have to go through the hassle and expense of building multiple versions of their apps?” He said Google manages this challenge to make sure there is a minimal level of compatibility among Android devices. “Critically, we give phone makers wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline, which is why you see such a varied universe of Android devices. That’s the key: our voluntary compatibility agreements enable variety, while giving developers confidence to create apps that run seamlessly across thousands of different phones and tablets. “This balance stimulates competition between Android devices as well as between Android and Apple’s iPhone,” Walker said. Pre-installed apps on Android Walker also hit out at the EC’s claims that Google shouldn’t pre-install Google apps such as Mail or Maps as part of a suite. Walker said that Android’s competitors offer less choice in the apps that come with their phones. He pointed out that, for example, on the Galaxy S7 from Samsung with Android 6.0, 11 out of 38 pre-installed apps are from Google; on the iPhone 7 with iOS 10, some 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps are from Apple; and on the Nokia Lumia 550 with Windows 10, 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps are from Microsoft. “On Android, Google’s apps typically account for less than one-third of the preloaded apps on the device, (and only a small fraction of device memory). A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no ‘foreclosure’.” Walker also defended the distribution of Google Search and Play which enables it to offer the suite for free, rather than charge licence fees. “This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone – it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play. “Today’s mobile devices show all the signs of fierce competition with a wide range of business models: from vertically integrated ones like Apple’s iOS, to open-source systems like Android. The rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices we see in smartphones represent the hallmarks of robust competition,” Walker said. Google campus at Mountain View, California.

Download the white paper now.  Brought to you in partnership with Hortonworks.  “The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.” — Mark Twain (albeit (mis)quoted) Hey, clickbait title aside, I get it, Elasticsearch has been growing. Kudos to the project for tapping into a new set of search users and use cases like logging, where they are making inroads against the likes of Splunk in the IT logging market. However, there is another open source, Lucene-based search engine out there that is quite mature, more widely deployed and still growing, granted without a huge marketing budget behind it: Apache Solr. Despite what others would have you believe, Solr is quite alive and well, thank you very much. And I’m not just saying that because I make a living off of Solr (which I’m happy to declare up front), but because the facts support it. For instance, in the Google Trends arena (see below or try the query yourself), Solr continues to hold a steady recurring level of interest even while Elasticsearch has grown. Dissection of these trends (which are admittedly easy to game, so I’ve tried to keep them simple), show Elasticsearch is strongest in Europe and Russia while Solr is strongest in the US, China, India, Brazil and Australia. On the DB-Engines ranking site, which factors in Google trends and other job/social metrics, you’ll see both Elasticsearch and Solr are top 15 projects, beating out a number of other databases like HBase and Hive. Solr’s mailing list is quite active (~280 msgs per week compared to ~170 per week for Elasticsearch) and it continues to show strong download numbers via Maven repository statistics. Solr as a codebase continues to innovate (which I’ll cover below) as well as provide regular, stable releases. Finally, Lucene/Solr Revolution, the conference my company puts on every year, continues to set record attendance numbers. Rather than getting into an “us vs. them” argument, however, I am going to focus the rest of this article on why you should consider Solr, especially if you haven’t looked at Solr 6.   1. Real Time, Massive Read, and Write Scalability If you haven’t looked at Solr since it’s early days (pre-Solr 4), you might be surprised to see that Solr supports large-scale, distributed indexing, search, and aggregation/statistics operations, enabling it to handle applications large and small. Solr also supports real-time updates and can handle millions of writes per second. For instance, at Lucene/Solr Revolution, Salesforce shared that they have over 500 billion complex — not just logs — documents in Solr and are doing 7 billion updates per day with a sub 100-millisecond query latency. Based on a number of other talks at Revolution (Bloomberg, Microsoft, Wal-Mart, et. al.) as well as knowledge of my company’s clientele, Salesforce isn’t alone in those numbers. 2. SQL and Streaming Expressions/Aggregations Streaming expressions and aggregations provide the basis for running traditional data warehouse workloads on a search engine with the added enhancement of basing those workloads on much more complex matching and ranking criteria than most data warehouses are capable of handling For instance, you might define a query that does a complex query across text, spatial, and numeric data and then rolls up on location, buckets into ranges by numeric data and then streams out the results to Tableau. Even better, you may simply hook up your favorite JDBC/ODBC client directly to Solr and write good old fashioned SQL queries to run against Solr. That functionality is still early in its support of the SQL specification, but it promises to bring the power of search-driven analytics to more people instead of trying to retrain them on new concepts. 3. Security Out of the Box For many open source based product companies, security is something you pay extra for. With Solr, security is built in, integrating with systems like kerberos, SSL, and LDAP to not only secure the system, but also the content inside of it. Add in support for graph queries (more on graph later) and you can represent very complex ACL-based (Access Control List) queries in highly dynamic environments. 4. Losing Data is for Losers In no small part due to its longstanding role in mission critical applications (think eCommerce on Black Friday), when Solr moved from a master-replica model to a fully distributed sharding model in Solr 4, the Solr community made a conscious decision to focus on consistency and accuracy of results over other distributed approaches. In doing so, the community chose Apache Zookeeper (or as I like to call it “Apache Give Me My Nights and Weekends Back”) to help with things like distributed coordination of resources and fault tolerance. While this added some overhead to Solr in getting started compared to other multicast/”zero conf” solutions, it more than makes up for it on the backend in terms of making sure that data loss is minimized and that the cluster can tell when it is happy or not, all things that keep many DevOps and Engineers up at night when supporting other distributed systems. This is, of course, not to say that Solr is perfect here, but it has proven to stand up well compared to others in this arena. If you really like to geek out on distributed system testing, be sure to check out Solr’s fork of Kyle Kingsbury’s (aka @aphyr, the destroyer of distributed systems) work on Jepsen.   5. Cross Data Center Replication Support Continuing on the theme of “getting your nights and weekends back”, Solr has recently added support for active-passive Cross Data Center Replication (CDCR), enabling real-world applications to synchronize indexing operations across data centers located in different parts of the world without the need for third-party systems like Apache Kafka. In Solr’s case, “passive” is often milliseconds or seconds (as opposed to minutes and hours) for low-to-medium ingest rates (which is commonly the case for content like eCommerce product catalogs but not the case for logging) and the community is working on a number of improvements to performance. Physics plays a role as well, so if CDCR is what you are after, be sure to invest in the network, too. 6. Graph Support As I mentioned earlier and in an effort to be fully buzzword compliant, Solr has added support for graph operations over the data that allow you to query and work with complex relationships between data and then output to formats like GraphML. Graph operations can be used to model recommendation systems (“people who bought this, bought that”), access controls in securing content and other complex relationships where traditional search systems typically fail (“find me all customers whose supplier is AcmeCo and their contract language contains version 1 of our indemnification verbiage”.) And since Solr’s graph capabilities are built on the streaming expressions capability discussed earlier, you can combine all of these features together to build very complex solutions to data analysis problems. Keep in mind, Solr’s support for graph is still up and coming compared to long-lived graph libraries like Neo4J, but the fact that it exists at all may mean you can simplify your application by removing yet another moving part. 7. Solr Plays Nice With Big Data Toolchains Many modern real world applications consist of two parts: a query engine to serve up the best known state of the data of interest and an offline engine designed to update and enhance that best known state. For instance, when you query Google, you get results based on the last time Google crawled/accessed the data in question. It could be two minutes ago or two weeks ago. For us mere mortals, this typically means we use tools like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark and various other “Hadoop Stack” capabilities to handle the offline crunching of data. Solr plays nicely in this stack in a number of ways: 1) Users can store Solr’s data in HDFS, 2) Solr integrates nicely with Hadoop’s authentication approaches (typically Kerberos), 3) Solr leverages Zookeeper much like Apache HBase to simplify fault tolerance infrastructure, 4) the Spark-Solr project works hard to make sure Solr does what it is good at and Spark does what it is good at (this combo forms the basis of my company’s product, Lucidworks Fusion), 5) Hive, Pig, Storm, and Map-Reduce are also all represented with open source repositories. 8. First Class Documentation and Support Solr has long maintained an extensive reference guide that covers functional and operational aspects of Solr for every version. Whether you are just getting started or looking for which knobs to tune for performance, the reference guide likely covers it. If it doesn’t, there are a large number of books written on Solr as well as a healthy mailing list and Stack Overflow Q&A community.  Finally, while I am biased to one in particular, there are a number of consultants and vendors who can provide professional support. 9. Kibana and Logstash Both Work with Solr Open Source FTW! Originally written to work with Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana, the popular tools for indexing and visualizing log and event data, both work with Solr. Logstash support is provided via a Solr plugin and Kibana has been forked via the Banana project.  10. Solr and Machine Learning For consumer and other high user volume sites, the core ranking function provided by Lucene is often not enough to achieve best in class relevance results. Many best in class search systems these days also incorporate machine learning algorithms that examine how users interact with content in search and then re-rank future searches to account for what users are most likely to care about. In search speak, this is called Learning to Rank (LTR) and Solr is actively adding capabilities to make LTR an out of the box functionality. Combining this with the Spark integration mentioned earlier and you can have a smart, fast search system using best in class techniques for ranking. Where to Next? All of the above are technical reasons you should consider Solr, but there are also one really important intangible benefit of Solr: it is an Apache Software Foundation (ASF) project, which means it’s not just open source, but open development. Solr is backed by a committee of maintainers who work for a variety of different companies, big and small. This benefits the code as well as the development process and ensures the project is viable long past the contribution of any one person or company. To give Solr a try, check out the quickstart.

By Sarmistha Acharya November 11, 2016 08:57 GMT Google machine learning to save sea cowsGetty Images/Guillaume Souvant Can Google's machine learning technology help sea mammals such as sea cows that are under the threat of extinction? Scientists believe it can. Amanda Hodgson of Murdoch University and her team, along with computer scientist at Queensland University of Technology Frederic Maire, have created a detector using Google's TensorFlow platform that can automatically find sea cows in aerial photos of oceans taken from drones. TensorFlow, Google's second generation machine-learning system was launched last year. It is developed by the researchers at Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organisation. TensorFlow is twice as fast as its predecessor DistBelief. This technology is very much like the image recognition tool that lets you search Google Photos for particular things such as dog species etc. Josh Gordon, developer advocate at Google noted that scientists had to spend a long time peering out of planes for sea cow census, which was an expensive and hazardous process. Meanwhile, Hodgson came up with an idea to use drones to take aerial photography of oceans. Hodgson had clicked as many as 45,000 ocean photos using drones and had to undertake the task of manually detecting sea cows in those photos. But Google's TensorFlow can perform the task of finding the endangered species from the photos. Scientists said that an early version of the detector helped them find 80% of the sea cows that they had found manually in photos. Now, they expect to improve the performance of the detector and use the technology to detect other sea mammals such as humpback whales and certain dolphins. "Eventually if they're able to track these threatened populations on a large scale, conservationists have a much better shot at knowing how they're impacted by human activities, and where it's most urgent we protect their habitats. In a small way, machine learning might help save the humble sea cow," Gordon noted.

The rapsheet targets one of Google's most sensitive businesses, as smartphones become by far the dominant player over PCs and laptops. "Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it," said Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, in a blog. Google was responding to a long list of charges involving Android that Margrethe Vestager, the EU's outspoken competition commissioner, filed in April. They include the claim that the firm used practices such as making manufacturers pre-install its market-leading search engine as well as its Chrome browser as the default in their phones. "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosytem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers and mobile operators," Walker said. Google's response comes a week after the company rejected separate EU charges over online shopping and its advertising services in a series of rulings against US companies that has raised hackles across the Atlantic. The Android charges are seen as especially sensitive for one of Google's most strategic businesses that could alter a global smartphone sector which has taken over traditional PCs as the biggest segment in the world of computing. The case only pertains to Android-run phones, with the European Commission not considering Apple's iPhone as a factor in the case. 'INTO COMPLIANCE' The EU in its charge sheet accused Google of obstructing innovation by giving unfair prominence to its own apps, especially its search engine, in deals with giant mobile manufacturers such as South Korea's Samsung or China's Huawei. "No manufacturer is obliged to pre-load any Google apps on an Android phone," Google insisted. Google is also accused of restricting manufacturers from installing rival versions or modifications of Android, an open source software operating system, on their phones. The commission, through a spokesman, confirmed the receipt of Google's official response. "As is standard practice, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation," it said. Google critics rejected the company's arguments. "Google imposes severe sanctions on those who defy its insistence on conformity," said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, a group that represents many of the complainants in the case. "This is a problem that law enforcement can solve, by acting to bring Google into compliance with competition law," he added. Complainants who brought the case to the EU include Yandez, a Russia-based search engine that says Google is stopping it from expanding beyond Russia. They also include telecom companies that are looking to have better control of the Android software they provide on their smartphones. But Google, which originally created Android, says limiting changes by companies to the system helps software developers so they do not have to make many versions of their apps to run on different versions of Android.

Google has finally delivered on a promise it made a long time ago and has brought a newly updated Android Auto which can work in not just premium cars but every car. The Android Auto gives a ‘car mode’ to the smartphone which oversizes a simplified version of the user interface and brings it into the car screen. All the user needs to do is download the app from Google Play, which is only available in the US as of now. After that, the user will have to give access to the application for various permissions including calling and messaging so that the app can play it back for the user. After the setup, the user will get the interface on the screen of the car. The Android Auto gives quick access to some important features which can come very handy while driving, which includes directions and music. Interestingly, catering to the safety of the user, the access to music is only for the playlists and shortcuts, which is great thinking from Google. Other apps that can be accessed are, Kik, WhatsApp and Skype and music apps like Spotify, Google Play, Pandora etc. The user can just swipe right or tap the Menu button, then choose Apps for Android Auto, and find out. In case the messaging app sis compatible with the Android Auto, it can also generate a default message of “I’m driving right now” and send it to another caller. Users can also change the text of the message by: swipe right (or tap the Menu icon), then tap Settings and then Auto reply. Navigation can be accessed on the home screen of Android Auto. A simple ‘OK Google’ gives the user access to Google Maps. Using Auto Launch, the Android Auto gets automatically switched on one the user connects the app through Bluetooth in the car. All in all, Android Auto is a great move by Google, making driving safer. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The ad and search giant points out in a neat animated GIF that of the 39 bundled apps on an iPhone, all 39 of them stem from Apple; on a Lumia 550, 39 of the 47 apps are from Microsoft; but lovely Google only has 11 of the 38 pre-installed apps on a Galaxy S7. The argument is a little obtuse since the EC's biggest concern is not the percentage of apps but the fact that Google forces all Android-based phone manufacturers to include its full suite of Google apps – everything from Gmail to Maps to Chrome and YouTube – if they want to add the Play Store to the phone. Since the store is critical to finding and installing quality apps, and installing some security patches, and hence allows a device to function as a competent handheld, the EC argues that Google is abusing its power. Google's response amounts to: if you think we're bad, you should see what others are up to. Plus, it says with wide puppy-dog eyes, bundling its other products with the app store means that it can give people everything for free. If it stopped doing that – the pleading look turning to a gentle growl – it may have to start charging fees. "This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone - it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play," Google's general counsel Kent Walker notes. Number three The response is the third by the company to a wide-ranging antitrust investigation by the EC. It looked at five areas of concern with Google: content scraping, maps and localized search, advertising, price-comparison features for online shopping, and Android. The EC lodged formal charges on the latter three and Google is finally responding – after a number of extensions – to the last one. We don't have the full response from Google to Europe but it has produced what we can assume is a version of it arguments in an official blog post, complete with GIFs. As well as pointing out it has fewer pre-installed apps than its smartphone rivals, and that it allows rival apps to be installed, Google also complains that the very fact that the iPhone exists is evidence that it is not abusing its position. "To ignore competition with Apple," writes Walker, "is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape." In fact, Google says, if anything it has made competition possible. "European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world," his post argues. "Android is not a 'one way street'; it's a multi-lane highway of choice." As for Google flexing its muscles on the hardware side, Walker paints its influence as "working with hardware makers to establish a minimum level of compatibility among Android devices." And argues that it gives manufacturers "wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline." Fragile What's more, even though Google is one of the largest companies in the world and that there are well over a billion active Android users, the whole thing is, apparently, incredibly delicate. "Open-source platforms are fragile," Walker warns. "They survive and grow by balancing the needs of all participants, including users and developers. The Commission’s approach would upset this balance, and send an unintended signal favouring closed over open platforms. It would mean less innovation, less choice, less competition, and higher prices. That wouldn’t be just a bad outcome for us. It would be a bad outcome for developers, for phone makers and carriers, and, most critically, for consumers." To be fair to Google, it does take a lighter touch than other phone companies, and in some cases, its approach seems to be too lax – such as the broken security update approach where some phones sit unpatched for months or simply not at all. But everything that Google says can be true and it can still be abusing its market power. Just because you help an old granny over the road doesn't mean you can kick a dog. Plus, of course, Android devices now account for three-quarters of the smartphone market in Europe, and that share is increasing. If the EC didn't investigate and didn't put pressure on Google to make sure it is not abusing that enormous level of control, the commission wouldn't be doing its job. As to where things will end up, it's hard to tell. The EC has a long history of wielding antitrust measures against US tech companies. In recent years, it has picked fights with Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. In some cases, the EC has largely walked away; in others, it has spent years fighting for changes such as when it forced Microsoft to offer Windows without Windows Player. There is of course one additional factor in play now: with president-elect Donald Trump entering the White House in the new year, the extremely cosy relationship between the Obama Administration and Google will come to an end. Without high-level political backing, Google may find its sheen is less bright in political quarters. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 41 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

This is the first time Google has shared this number. Google didn’t announce any new user numbers for Chrome at the Chrome Dev Summit. The latest stat for active Chrome users remains at 1 billion — a number Google shared in April. While this number is surely higher today than it was six months ago, the company decided to focus on the number of active browser install today. “I wanted to make this point that there are a lot of Chrome browsers out there,” Fisher said. “What’s exciting about this to you all is that when you think about building for the web, there’ a lot of browsers out there that implement the latest web standards — that implement the latest and greatest web features.” As Google says, it now has seven products with more than a billion users (Gmail, Android, Chrome, Maps, Search, Youtube and the Google Play store).

Login Search Google Feels Heat From EU Cases -- WSJ November 11, 2016, 02:47:00 AM EDT By Dow Jones Business News Shutterstock photo By Natalia Drozdiak and Sam Schechner BRUSSELS -- Snowed under by formal antitrust charges leveled at three different areas of its business, Alphabet Inc.'s Google may be increasingly tempted to reopen previously unsuccessful negotiations with the European Union's competition authorities to settle the cases. Google on Thursday fired off its response to the third set of formal charges issued by the European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator -- this time rebutting the EU's allegations that the search giant abuses its dominance with its mobile operating service Android. The statement follows tech giant's response last week to allegations in two other cases related to its shopping search service and to one of its niche advertising products. If the EU deems Google guilty, the regulator could impose hefty fines in each of the three cases and require that Google overhaul its operations in parts. But such a finding by the EU could also cause further damage for Google. The tech giant would likely also face costs associated with years of legal battles, against the EU as well as private litigants seeking compensation for damages. Settling the cases with the commission could wipe out some of those problems. Google would have to pledge to significant changes to its operations and would only get hit with a fine if it goes back on its promise. It would also absolve Google from admitting guilt, making it harder for private litigants to claim damages. But it is unclear to what extent the option is feasible after Google for years haggled with the previous antitrust commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, about how to present search results in Europe in various attempts at a settlement with the regulator. Those previous efforts failed, after Google rivals complained that the proposed settlements wouldn't have required significant changes in Google's practices. The EU's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, who lodged formal charges against Google in April 2015, has said the settlement option is open. But she has indicated that any fresh proposal would need to differ substantially from the three earlier attempts. "If it didn't work under Almunia, my sense is that it wouldn't work now under Vestager who is really trying to make a point," said Michael Carrier, an antitrust professor at Rutgers Law School. While the commission may be eager to reach a guilty decision in the Google case to deter other firms from pursuing anticompetitive behavior, a settlement in some or all of Google's three cases would free much-needed resources in the antitrust regulator's department. Some rivals say they wouldn't in principle oppose a settlement between Google and the commission. "If there is scope for truly effective remedies, then many of the complainants would likely welcome it," said Thomas Vinje, a Brussels-based partner at Clifford Chance who represents complainants against Google. "We have no interest in a fine, it's the conduct that matters." Google has said it doesn't rule out any options. The company's immediate priority, however, is to respond to the EU's charges and submit evidence to refute the regulator's allegations. Google may find it easier to change behavior in some cases rather than others. In the EU's advertising case, Google said it has already phased out some of its most restrictive requirements for Google ads in its AdSense for Search contracts. But as the EU delves deeper into Google's core business areas, such as Android, "the less likely Google would want to voluntarily give what it sees as its way of making money in the future," Mr. Carrier said. Since its launch in 2007, Android has grown into a behemoth, running more than 80% of the world's smartphones, with a much bigger presence in Europe than in the U.S. market. The EU accuses Google of abusing that dominance to force phone makers into favoring the Google search engine and Chrome browser on their devices. Those apps ensure consumers see Google's search advertisements -- its cash cow -- when they look things up on their smartphones. The case has led some lawyers to draw direct links to the commission's successful 2004 decision condemning Microsoft for bundling products into its Windows software. "Realizing that, the rational thing to do is to settle," said Nicholas Economides, an economics professor at New York University Stern School of Business. Google rejects the comparison to the Microsoft case, arguing that nothing restricts phone makers or telecom companies from installing other apps on phones. "No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone," Google's Mr. Walker said in Thursday's blog post. "But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone you can access a familiar set of basic services." --Stu Woo contributed to this article.

Today, Mark Zuckerberg denies claims that Facebook influenced the US election result, the 2003 Beagle lander came down safely on Mars, Google has told the European Commission that its business practices are not anticompetitive.

Zuckerberg: Facebook didn't influence US election result Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spoken out against claims that the social network influenced the outcome of the US presidential election due to the effect of fake news stories and 'filter bubbles' on users' news feeds (TechCrunch). Speaking at Techonomy16, Zuckerberg said: “Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.” He also noted that "the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn’t there, or that you don’t have friends who support the other candidate, or who are from another religion, but that you just tune it out when you see it."

Mars image analysis reveals that Beagle 2 landed safely in 2003 Scientists working with images showing the 2003's failed Beagle 2 Mars lander on the red planet's surface have concluded that it successfully landed on the Martian surface and deployed three of its four solar panels (Space.com). However, the European lander's failure to deploy its fourth panel is likely to have hindered its ability to communicate with Earth, explaining its radio silence. Former Beagle 2 mission manager Mark Sims said that "we have gathered more information on the failure of Beagle 2 to communicate, and we are one step closer to knowing what happened'. 3. EU antitrust case: Google maintains that Android hasn't blocked competition Google has responded to the European Commission's claims that it has abused Android's market position with a flat denial (Ars Technica). Smartphone makers who wish to include the Google Play store on their Android devices are contractually obliged to include a number of other Google apps, most notably Google Search. Google says that such business practices are neither anti-competitive nor unusual in the mobile phone market. Google general counsel Kent Walker said that "the commission argues that we shouldn’t offer some Google apps as part of a suite. No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone. But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone, you can access a familiar set of basic services. Android’s competitors, including Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice." 4. Scottish island to use spare TV spectrum to speed up broadband Spare radio frequency spectrum left over from the digital TV switchover will be used improve broadband access on the Scottish island of Arran (WIRED). The rollout, the first of its kind in Europe, will be used to improve broadband speeds for the island’s 5,000 residents. It’s hoped the use of TV white space can help bridge the urban-rural broadband divide and better connect the UK’s more remote communities. The technology is being rolled-out through a partnership between internet firm Nominet and broadband campaign group Broadway Partners. TV white space has been trialled and teased as a potentially useful technology ever since vast swathes became available when the UK completed its move to digital TV in October 2012.

Oculus makes Rift compatible with lower-spec PCs Oculus has announced a new feature that allows lower-spec PCs to power the company's Rift virtual reality headset (The Verge). The 'asynchronous spacewarp' feature, "extrapolates frames and lets VR titles run at up to half rate, while delivering a visual experience that’s almost as good as native 90hz rendering". Users will now be able to use the Rift on PCs with a minimum spec of an Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB RAM and an Nvidia GTX 960 graphics card. By comparison, the previous minimum space required an i5 processor and a GTX 970 or better.

Review: Google Daydream View VR headset Google's Daydream View is now available to buy in the US and UK, and the neatly designed, lightweight mobile virtual reality headset is a marked upgrade to the company's budget Cardboard VR kit (WIRED). Currently, you'll need a Google Pixel phone to use the Daydream app, although it will work with other Android Nougat devices as they're released. While there are still some teething problems when it comes to pairing and configuration, the £69 Daydream View is sturdily built, comfortable to use and is already supported by a wide range of apps, making it an ideal stepping stone into the world of advanced mobile VR.

Video: Researchers tickle delighted rats – for science German researchers have identified the part of the brain that causes ticklishness, with the help of some delighted rats (Science). The scientists recorded brain activity in the rodents' somatosensory cortex while they were being tickled. During tickling play, the team noted an increase in the rate at which cells fired, which they were able to replicate by applying light electrical stimulation to the same part of the brain. The study provides new insight not only into how to make a happy rat laugh, but also into the nature of the human tickle response. 8.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Keeps up Promise by Launching Standalone App Version of Android Auto November 11, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Google Overhauls Gmail to Offer Better & Faster Experience in iOS Boom Supersonic Commercial Jets to Take Wing Android Auto and Apple CarPlay were some serious introductions that partly revolutionized the media interface of car stereo system. Partly only because it never was made ready for all; Android Auto was available only in the new arrivals, or would at least require an expensive head unit. But thankfully, that’s just an old story now, as Google has finally introduced the standalone app version of Android Auto like they have promised before. The app version doesn’t takes down anything from the real version of Android Auto, and gives a fairly similar experience of jumping through the car infotainment experience offered by Google. The interface also remains the same so that users don’t miss out on anything when using the app. Android Auto is presented to offer users get richer with two features; navigation and music. For this, Google has introduced card-type layout for Google Play Music and directions. Android Auto will automatically load some of your frequently visited locations to get it synced through to the app, and it will be done once you give the initial permissions. Google has also decided to restrict the access to all the features, keeping the focus on driving. That means that while users can enjoy skipping through tracks and get their playlists loaded, they might still be not able to have a list of their entire music library, or get items searched through keyboard. That’s a good move, considering that Android Auto is meant to be used in between drive sessions. Apart from music and navigation, Android Auto also arrives with features like display of alerts, calls, notifications, weather support etc. Again, Google has played it smart by getting rid of the option to respond to text messages. As of now, it also lacks the support of activation via Ok Google commands, but Google says that it will soon be rolled out to the app version. Users can check the availability of the app in their devices from here.

Join For Free Here are seven perils and pitfalls to avoid if you want your app to succeed in the language markets of your choice Why iOS localization? Business is international and Apple proves it. Reports from a year or two ago (2015) indicated that the company had started to sell more iPhones in China than it was already selling in the US. Of course, Apple also sells its iOS-based products all over the world. For product managers for iOS apps, that means an opportunity and a threat. If you don’t move to address the needs of different international markets, competitors will fill the void, build up their user bases, and attack you in your home market from a position of globally massive strength. On the other hand, to market an iOS app to international markets for bigger market share and higher revenues, you have a head start. iPhones and iPads are multilingual by design, and make it easy for users to select the local language interfaces they favor. In addition, Apple offers tools to help your developers to produce local language versions of your app that make sense to your target users abroad. You may already be thinking that there is more to iOS localization than meets the eye. You’re right! Here are seven perils and pitfalls to avoid if you want your app to succeed in the language markets of your choice. 1. Thinking You Don’t Need All That IOS Localization What? After our inspiring remarks above, could anybody who has read this far doubt that localization is important, even essential to iOS app commercial success? The point we are making here is rather subtler. Don’t think that localization is simply about translating from one language to another. For instance, if you are an English-speaking person, your point of reference in terms of search engines is probably Google, the 800 pound SE gorilla in the Western world. But not in China (1 billion plus people), where Baidu beats Google. GALA, the Globalization and Localization Association, points out that “Baidu does better than Google because it looks and feels fully native to the Chinese-speaking audience.” The moral of the story is that localization may have to be done at more than one level, and that in some cases an overly shallow approach may not get you any more business benefit than no localization at all. 2. Confusing Internationalization and Localization This is a key point when you’re trying to hammer out release schedules of localized versions with your development team. Full of enthusiasm, you want your Japanese localized version now, and your Spanish version by yesterday. After all, it’s just a matter of handing the app over to translators, right? Not quite. What your development team is probably patiently trying to tell you is that before producing these different localized versions, the software needs to be internationalized. Internationalization essentially ensures that your app can be sensibly localized into any language. It takes care of aspects like number and date formats, changing positions of variables in sentences according to language, and plurals. As an eye-opener, ask your development team how plurals work in Russian and Hebrew, for example, compared to English. Luckily, Apple’s iOS development framework offers developers tools to help get plurals and other tricky issues right the first time for any language. Once the internationalization has been done properly, localization into a specific language is more a matter of handing over a file for translation to a competent translator or translation agency. A decision about whether to add a new localized language can then be as simple as a calculation taking into account the potential additional revenue compared with the translation costs and support effort. 3. Not Distinguishing Between Different Versions of the Same Language Do you think English is the same, wherever it’s used? A quick look at date formats between US and UK English will prove the contrary. If you tell a British native that it’s October 5 using a US date format (10/5), he or she will think you mean May 10. And how about Chinese? GALA suggests that 30 percent of the Chinese population does not speak the country’s national language. Chinese consists of seven different versions or linguistic classifications: Gan (Jiangzinese), Guan (Mandarin), Kejia (Hakka), Min (Hokkien), Wu (Shanghainese), Xiang (Hunanese) and Yue (Cantonese). Mandarin Chinese federates 1.3 billion speakers worldwide, but Cantonese and the Min language are in close second and third position. The equivalent in the US market, for instance, would be to produce different versions of your app for New Yorkers, Texans, Californians, and Alaskans. In the US, this extra effort would be unlikely to make business sense, because standard US English is understood across the country. By comparison, for China, the effort is essential because many people using one version of Chinese will simply not understand people using another version. 4. Missing Or Mishandling Key Localization Aspects Of An App Don’t expect your developers to cover absolutely all the bases when it comes to localization. While they may correctly identify the different user-facing texts in the app, including help and error messages, they may not appreciate other niceties. One example is keyword optimization to help your localized iOS app garner more attention and more users in the Apple App Store. In this case, you cannot even rely on the correct translation of the keywords that work for your iOS app in your home market. The reason for this is that keywords that work for a given market depend on factors specific to that market, such as culture, politics, and national or regional events. For instance, linking your app to a popular presidential candidate in the US could do wonders for take-up in America. Yet it may fall flat in Germany, where they have their own national politics to keep them busy. Localization of a keyword has to be done from the inside out, so to speak, by first finding out which local language keywords are important to potential users of your app within that country and how fierce the local competition is to be ranked on such keywords. 5. Using Automated Translation For understanding the general sense of a text written in a foreign language, automated translation software can be useful. However, for making a favorable impression on end-users, it can leave a lot to be desired. Such software can give very good results in some cases, and very bad results in others, but you’ll never know whether you’re getting the good or the bad. A classic example is the phrase “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak,” ending up translated into other languages as “The wine is ready, but the meat is underdone.” So don’t give in to pressure from your development team to simply run your app’s file for localization through an automated translation system. They may not have developed your superior sensitivity to the far-reaching linguistic and cultural issues at stake (unless you give them this article to read.) While automated systems continue to improve in quality, there is no guarantee they will be able to replace human translation, at least in the foreseeable future. Competent human translation is therefore what you need, with empathy for your targeted end-users for a given localization. 6. Expecting Your Translators to Work “Blind” Context and situation are often vital pieces of information for a good iOS localization. A word in one language may have several completely different possible translations in another. Classic examples in English for iOS and other software applications are words like “run” and “clear.” Only additional information about the context can help a translator understand whether the words in question are nouns, verbs, adjectives, or some other grammatical construct. Checking translations after they have been done requires painstaking verification word by word. Murphy’s Law then says that the one or two incorrect translations that slip through will be precisely the ones that do maximum damage to the credibility and reputation of your app in its localized version. A better way forward is to give information to translators ahead of time, for instance as comments in the files to be translated. Your smarter, more localization-sensitive developers will already understand the desirability of doing this; you may have to gently educate the others. 7. Failing To Use Native Language Speakers to Test the Localized Version You need human translators to produce a localized version of your app. You also need native speaker human beings to check the final result. It is true that Apple gives developers tools to check if localization of words or phrases has been missed, or if translations will cause screen layout problems due to differences in length. These tools are valuable, but they do not replace native speaker capabilities and judgment about the overall quality of a translation, and whether the localization will meet with approval and subscriptions in the market concerned. Conclusion The big takeaway from all this is that successful iOS localization is about seeing things from the point of view of the customer or user in the market you are targeting. This is a simple to say, but not always easy to do. Nevertheless, two important factors can help your iOS localizations to succeed. The first is that the localization tools Apple provides within the iOS framework can help your developers better understand and handle the issues of different languages. The second is that localization tools and local market experts and are available, externally if not internally, to give you an objective appraisal of what works in your localized app and what should be improved. So with these resources to help you, good luck… or rather, good localization!

But according to Clay Bavor, vice president of VR at Google, it is still early days for virtual reality and we are yet to completely exploit it. Speaking at a Recode event in California, Bavor said, “The headset we’re launching today, we’re using it as, ‘Hey, here’s an example.’ We’re in such early days of VR — 99.9 percent of things in VR have yet to be discovered.” According to him Google is looking at making Android as the main OS for VR. Right now VR headsets have yet to go mainstream. Bavor says that VR will get popular when there are enough users, enough devices and enough things to do on VR. Daydream VR platform is offering video content with YouTube VR, games as well as some tie-in with Google Street View which will let you check out popular monuments and Google Art and Culture which will let you see around 50 museums across the globe in VR. Speaking on the choice to go with a soft cloth material for the Daydream VR headset, Bavor said, “What we saw was that some things were complicated, to just get everything connected and get into VR. We thought control could be a bit better. VR is exciting, but not that approachable to many people. The devices look a bit intimidating. So we looked at it more like a piece of clothing. That’s let us down this path of ‘what if we use materials like a micro-fibre fabric or breathable cloth’. The result is something we are proud of.” Google isn’t the only player in the VR business though. Facebook owned Oculus has two consumer offerings in the form of Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR, HTC has Vive whereas Microsoft has a mixed reality headset in the form of HoloLens which works on the Windows ecosystem.

Google has a strange love-hate relationship with the feature despite users demanding the feature since Android Lollipop. Google Play store has several apps developed by independent app developers to enable the functionality since Android Kitkat. Google teasted the feature in beta version for Android Marshmallow but the feature did not make to the final release. This feature is useful for users who use their smartphones at night for instance for reading books for extended period of time. The feature changes the colours rendered on the display by making the temperature warmer and removing the blue light. This is in addition to converting all the white-coloured user interface to black to decrease unnecessary white light. Android Dark Mode, Image Credit: AndroidCentral The company again teased the feature in the beta version for Android Nougat 7.0 but it did not make to the final build. However, this time it seems that the feature can finally make it to the final build, as the company just marked the issue on Android Open Source Project (AOSP) – Issue tracker as closed. The issue “Bring back Night Mode” is marked as “FutureRelease” which could mean that the company may be bringing in the future updates of Android, possibly the next Android 7.1 Developer preview as reported by AndroidCentral. We can only hope that the company will not remove it from the final build of Android Nougat 7.1. One thing to note is that Google Pixel and Pixel XL already run on Android 7.1, which means that the feature will make way to older smartphones. This is a rollback from the statement made by Ian Lake in October that the “Night Light” feature uses new hardware composer interface instead of a GL Shader. He further outlined that there was no driver support available for the feature to be implemented in Nexus devices. This roll back is a good news as people no longer need to root their devices to gain such basic functionality and there is no need to purchase new hardware.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 11 November 2016 | MYT 2:30 PM Google rejects EU antitrust charges over Android Vehemently denied: The Android charges are seen as especially sensitive for one of Google’s most strategic businesses that could alter a global smartphone sector which has taken over traditional PC’s as the biggest segment in the world of computing. — AFP BRUSSELS: US Internet giant Google rejected EU allegations that it abused the market dominance of its hugely successful Android mobile phone operating system.  The rapsheet targets one of Google’s most sensitive businesses, as smartphones become by far the dominant player over PCs and laptops.  ”Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it,” said Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, in a blog.  Google was responding to a long list of charges involving Android that Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s outspoken competition commissioner, filed in April.  They include the claim that the firm used practices such as making manufacturers pre-install its market-leading search engine as well as its Chrome browser as the default in their phones.  ”The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers and mobile operators,” Walker said.  Google’s response comes a week after the company rejected separate EU charges over online shopping and its advertising services in a series of rulings against US companies that has raised hackles across the Atlantic.  The Android charges are seen as especially sensitive for one of Google’s most strategic businesses that could alter a global smartphone sector which has taken over traditional PC’s as the biggest segment in the world of computing.  The case only pertains to Android-run phones, with the European Commission not considering Apple’s iPhone as a factor in the case.   ‘Into compliance’  The EU in its charge sheet accused Google of obstructing innovation by giving unfair prominence to its own apps, especially its search engine, in deals with giant mobile manufacturers such as South Korea’s Samsung or China’s Huawei.  ”No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone,” Google insisted.  Google is also accused of restricting manufacturers from installing rival versions or modifications of Android, an open source software operating system, on their phones.  The commission, through a spokesman, confirmed the receipt of Google’s official response.  ”As is standard practice, we will carefully consider Google’s response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,” it said.  Google critics rejected the company’s arguments.  ”Google imposes severe sanctions on those who defy its insistence on conformity,” said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, a group that represents many of the complainants in the case.  ”This is a problem that law enforcement can solve, by acting to bring Google into compliance with competition law,” he added.  Complainants who brought the case to the EU include Yandez, a Russia-based search engine that says Google is stopping it from expanding beyond Russia.  They also include telecom companies that are looking to have better control of the Android software they provide on their smartphones.  But Google, which originally created Android, says limiting changes by companies to the system helps software developers so they do not have to make many versions of their apps to run on different versions of Android.  Developers of apps such as Spotify or WhatsApp, “depend on a stable and consistent framework to do their work,” Google said. — AFP You May Be

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise How Google RankBrain is Humanizing SEO SEO May 17, 2016 SEO Tamara WeintraubMay 17, 2016 1.9KSHARES 5.5KREADS 1.9KSHARES 5.5KREADS Tamara Weintraub 1.9KSHARES 5.5KREADS Since the end of 2015, Google has been using an artificial intelligence system called RankBrain to process search results and inform its core algorithm to deliver more relevant organic search results. But, we still don’t know much about how Google RankBrain works, and according to Google itself, they don’t really know either. What we have ascertained so far about how RankBrain impacts SEO is pivotal, and it means we need to start taking an even more human-first approach to search engine optimization. Google RankBrain is Not Itself an Algorithm, but it is Integral to One Google describes RankBrain as a key “signal” within its core search algorithm. Essentially, RankBrain is the part of the algorithm that is used to “understand” the meaning of billions of web pages and help Google’s algorithm return the ones that users will find the most relevant to their search queries. While there are potentially hundreds of (or more) ranking signals and sub-signals within Google’s algorithm, Google has confirmed that RankBrain is one of the three top signals that inform search results, along with links and content. It’s kind of like the Holy Trinity of Google, with RankBrain becoming the biggest and most influential of the three. That’s because for the queries it is responding to, RankBrain is informing Google’s algorithm not just about which links and content are best, but how it should interpret these types of signals in the future. This is incredibly important, because Google no longer has to make guesses about what it believes something means based on disparate factors like keywords and links, but is instead beginning to interpret data much like a person would. What this means: Although Google talks about RankBrain, content, and links as they are three parts of the same pie, rather, they all work together and inform one another. These signals (and their sub-signals) don’t each operate in a silo, so you shouldn’t treat them as such when it comes to your SEO strategy. In the same way, there are many parts — like your website’s technical structure, content, offsite presence, and more — that work together to determine your site’s performance for specific searches. So, make sure you are not just executing all the necessary tactics, but that all the pieces of your website and web presence are consistent and connected, and relevant to the actual users of your content. RankBrain is Learning How People Search (and What They Want) Unlike relying on simple connections between words or concepts, Google RankBrain uses mathematical processes and language semantics (understanding what something means rather than simply the words that are used) to understand complex search queries. RankBrain’s unique combination of machine learning and artificial intelligence allows it to look beyond basic language markers like “stemming” (variations of a word, like “searching” for “search”), synonyms, (like “company” and “business”), and basic conceptual understanding, (like knowing you’re searching for Michelangelo the artist and not Michelangelo the Ninja Turtle) that previously limited search engine capabilities. In the below example, you can see that Google relates “water heaters for sale” and “water heater repair” to the search term “who replaces water heaters.” While this is not a stretch, over time, Google RankBrain will learn even more about how people search (such as by asking questions) and the results they engage with, and apply those behaviors to inform future search results. Essentially, RankBrain is allowing Google to leverage human-like understanding and interpretation as a more effective way to identify content that people will respond to most in search results. This is, after all, what its algorithm has always been trying to achieve. But, thanks to advancements in machine learning and AI, Google is closer than ever to accomplishing this. What this means: This represents a critical shift in how we think about SEO long term. No longer is simply gaming the math of an algorithm a way to find yourself at the top of search results. Google continues to make enhancements that reward content and experiences that people use and find valuable. RankBrain is an integral way it’s able to do this more effectively than ever before. As people evolve in the ways they search and the phrases they use, Google’s algorithm is quickly adapting. We’ve already seen updates that positively reward sites that are mobile-friendly that contain high-quality content, and provide locally-relevant information in the search results – all factors that human users value highly. As RankBrain learns what makes searchers respond to certain pages in the search results over others, it will continue to change how Google’s algorithm interprets websites and determines a site’s search rank for each query – and reward the factors that actual people are responding to best. RankBrain Further Restricts Exact-Match Approaches to SEO Because it is helping Google’s algorithm look more holistically at the complexity of factors involved in the way people search, RankBrain represents a huge shift away from a time when the algorithm focused more on factors like keyword match. In fact, Google RankBrain interprets search queries and helps find web pages that enable Google to return higher quality results for complex or long-tail search queries – not necessarily those which contain an exact keyword or phrase match. RankBrain is especially useful because it applies meaning to searches for terms or concepts that Google doesn’t already have context for. Because it understands the semantics of a user’s search query, like in the above example “Who replaces water heaters in Seattle?” RankBrain is continuing Google’s path to deemphasizing the importance of exact keyword matches and relying on natural language when determining SEO rank and results. What this means: The content on your website and the way users engage with it is critical to your SEO strategy and how Google displays your site in search results. Although RankBrain isn’t the end-all-be-all of Google’s search algorithm, Google’s goal continues to provide the most relevant and useful results possible to searchers. So, it’s important that your website content is easy to understand, clearly formatted, and helpful for your target audience. Because soon, there won’t be much difference between how people read your site and how Google does. Final Thoughts SEO has always been an ongoing process that requires continual attention to search engine changes to get traffic from search results. With Google RankBrain, it’s even more important for businesses and website owners to understand the reasons behind search engine updates and recommendations, and to respond to them swiftly and with expertise to stay relevant in organic search. In fact, Google is taking even greater steps to shift away from a system that can be gamed through outdated tactics such as keyword-stuffing and paving the way for a more human-like approach to delivering great content and experiences to users via its search results. By making sure your website is designed and written for real people and the way they like to consume your content— and not for gaming search engines — your site will be more prepared for any changes Google throws your way.   Image Credits Featured Image: Antonio Guillem/Shutterstock.com In-post Photo: Screenshot by Tamara Weintraub.

If RankBrain is automatic, then it is expected that clicks, bounce rates, CTR and other similar behavior is tracked and helps determine RankBrain. TamaraWeintraub Hi Lou! Thanks for the comment. Hummingbird is Google’s search algorithm. RankBrain is a primary signal within that algorithm, helping it deliver relevant content to searchers. Tamizh Selvan Though many claim that rank brain is all about segregating exact search, the true insight of it still confusing. Does it have something to do with hummingbird? Somebody please explain. revereye Thank you for providing this information Pedro Matias I don’t doubt this is what RankBrain is intended to do, but at the moment it seems like a toddler with lots to learn yet, it seems to me experiments at the time of Hummingbird and Authorship were producing more non exact match results than I can see now. e.g. search for “SEO consultant” and see “SEO expert”, etc. In some niches including SEO in the UK, link builder and exact match keywords usage is alive and well and this old SEO/SPAM keeps doing very well on the SERPs.

[Note: Night mode enables blue light filter on device's display to help reduce eye strain while the user is reading under dark light condition] "Night Light uses a new hardware composer interface to do colour transforms on the display hardware rather than using a GL Shader, which unfortunately means it requires driver support that is not present on Nexus devices," Android team member Ian Lake said.

Version 4.0 swithces to a bottom navigation bar and has a new personalized “For you” seciton as the main feed. There is a search bar at the top of the app that expands to display a trending news section, topics, and news sources. Searching recommends topics to follow, news sources, magazines, and individual stories with the matching phrase. Conveniently, the search bar auto hides when scrolling The navigation drawer has been replaced with a white bottom bar that features icons for Library, Explore, Read Later, and For You. Those sections were previously accessible from the drawer and for the most part remains the same in version 4.0. Oddly, a drawer still exists to access settings and to enable the download only mode. “For You” completely replaces the more general “Read now” with recommended articles based on your interests. Suggested content comes from your web history and is similar to the cards found in Google Now. “Briefing” lists the “Top stories you need to know” and will send notifications for an overview of the news every morning. Underneath are personalized Highlights, featured topics with articles curated by editors, Local Stories, and Editor Picks. Mixed in are articles about topics you’ve shown an interest in and related articles. The former stories are usually from the publications you frequently visit. Individual stories exist as cards that feature a big header image, a YouTube video from the post, or auto-playing clips. Each card lists the title, publication, and has buttons to Read later, open the share sheet, and an overflow menu. That menu contains the ability to hide stories from publications or recommend seeing fewer stories, as well as seeing more from the site and topic. Compared to other news apps, Google’s has a big advantage of being able to offer truly personalized content from your browsing habits.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Gadgets The highlight of Google’s Daydream VR headset is the controller The highlight of Google’s Daydream VR headset is the controller Google Daydream View would pale compared with Samsung's Gear VR headset were it not for the controller. By: AP | Published:November 11, 2016 10:42 am Google’s Daydream View is a sit-down experience in which you use the controller to move yourself around. (Source: Reuters) By Anick Jesdanun/Associated Press The best thing about Google’s new virtual-reality headset isn’t the headset at all. In fact, Daydream View would pale compared with Samsung’s Gear VR headset were it not for Daydream’s controller, a handheld device that responds to gestures and other motion.  With Gear VR, I have to move my head to point a cursor at something, then reach for a button on the headset. With Daydream, I can just aim and click the controller in my hand. Sensors in the device tell the headset what I’m trying to do, whether it’s swinging a tennis racket or casting a fishing rod. The headset’s display responds accordingly. The headset and controller are sold together for $79, starting Thursday. No rush in getting one, though, as the virtual experiences built for Daydream are still limited. And for now, it works only with Google’s Pixel phone. THE MANY FLAVOURS OF VIRTUAL REALITY While sophisticated systems like Facebook’s Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive let you walk around in the virtual world, Daydream View is a sit-down experience in which you use the controller to move yourself around. (You could walk around with the Daydream on if you wanted to, but you won’t go anywhere in virtual space — and you might run into the wall.) But the Rift and the Vive each costs more than $1,500, once you include powerful personal computers they require. Suddenly, $79 sounds like a bargain. Daydream stays cheap by using the display and processing power of your phone, which you insert into the headset at eye level. Gear VR, at $100, takes a similar approach, but it works only with Samsung phones. While Daydream works only with Pixel for now, several other Android makers plan to make compatible phones. Sorry, iPhone users. Also read: Google Daydream View first impressions: Mobile VR gets serious Those without compatible phones still have Google Cardboard, a $15 contraption you hold up to your face. Using Daydream View, by contrast, is more like wearing goggles. While Gear VR has a better fit, with focusing and a second strap over your head to keep the headset from sliding too low, Daydream is much more comfortable to wear and use than Cardboard. ALL ABOUT THAT CONTROLLER Those who’ve played Nintendo’s Wii system will find the Daydream controller familiar. It’s about the size and shape of a chocolate bar, and it has motion sensors to track movement. Although I’m not a big gamer, I enjoyed shooting water out of a hose to put out fires. You simply hold a button to spray and move the controller around to douse flames. You can even tilt the controller to control the angle of the hose. Another app lets you explore the universe by using the controller as a laser pointer to bring up more information. The controller makes it easier to navigate menus without making yourself dizzy; just move it around to point at things. And while getting the full 360-degree experience of VR often requires spinning around (a swivel chair helps), some apps in Daydream let you grab the scene with your controller and drag it around you, just as you would with a PC mouse. Also read: Google Pixel XL review: The new Android flagship in the market It’s also handy to have volume controls and a home button in your hand rather than on your head. NAUSEA FREE? VR can be nauseating, and Daydream is no different. I found that it’s less about the headset, and more about the VR video. The best videos use stationary cameras and let you move your head (or controller) around to explore. The nauseating ones tend to treat VR cameras like regular movie cameras , with a lot of panning in response to a subject’s movements. The viewer, not the subject, should be the one doing the moving. And while I enjoyed watching a woman’s skydive in VR on YouTube, scenes of her preparing to jump felt jarring because the camera was on her shaky arm. I had to remove my headset. WHAT’S THERE TO DO? You can view 360-degree YouTube videos and any 360-degree photos you store on Google Photos. You can visit other destinations such as the Galapagos Islands in a 360-degree version of Google’s Street View. A few games, museum artworks and The Wall Street Journal’s app were also available to try out prior to Thursday’s launch. A handful more are coming Thursday. Even more are promised by the end of the year, including apps for Netflix and Hulu — though all that does is offer video on a giant screen in a virtual living room. There’s much more available for Cardboard. Unfortunately, app developers will need to make some tweaks first to make them compatible with Daydream. They’ll need to do even more to take advantage of the motion control. Daydream has promise, but until more apps arrive, its potential is still a dream.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News EU antitrust case: Google general counsel says Android boosts competition EU antitrust case: Google general counsel says Android boosts competition Google EU anti-trust case: The Android issue could potentially be the most damaging for the search giant. By: Reuters | Updated: November 11, 2016 10:44 am Google’s Android mobile operating system boosts competition rather than hurts it, says the company’s legal counsel. (Source: Express Photo) Google’s Android mobile operating system boosts competition rather than hurts it, the company’s general counsel said on Thursday, in a rebuttal of EU antitrust charges that it uses the platform to crush rivals.  The comments by Google general counsel Kent Walker on a blog came a week after the US technology group rejected two other EU accusations of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking competitors in online search advertising. The Android case could potentially be the most damaging for Google. Android has made about $31 billion in revenue and $22 billion in profit for Google since its release in 2008, an Oracle Corp lawyer told a US court in January. Android’s market share in Europe is above 90 percent, according to the European Commission. Walker said the Commission has got the whole case wrong, ignoring both the fierce rivalry with iPhone maker Apple , the demands from apps developers and the dangers of modified versions of Android. “The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it,” he said. The case is distorted because the EU competition enforcer does not see Apple’s iOS as a rival to Android, he said. “To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape,” Walker said. The company said it bundles some of its apps and products in order to offer the package for free instead of charging upfront licensing fees. Such a practice put Microsoft in the EU crosshairs, eventually resulting in millions of euros of fines for the US software company.  Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso confirmed receipt of Google’s response. Lobbying group and complainant FairSearch, whose members include US travel sites Expedia and TripAdvisor , dismissed Google’s arguments. Also read: Google formally rejects EU antitrust charges; faces $7.4 billion fine “The truth is that Android is today a closed operating system, and any claim to the contrary is disingenuous. Google imposes severe sanctions on those who defy its insistence on conformity,” FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said in a statement. The EU antitrust enforcer intends to hit the company with deterrent fines in the Android and shopping cases, according to charge sheets seen by Reuters. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion, or 10 percent of Google’s global turnover, for each case if it is found guilty of breaching EU rules.

We're live from our Code Mobile conference with Clay Bavor, Google's Vice President of VR to find out.Posted by Recode on Thursday, November 10, 2016 Google’s first virtual reality headset, the $79 Daydream View, started shipping today — but that’s just one piece of a much bigger initiative. Google wants to make Android the primary operating system for VR. Its vision is that there will be lots of Daydream-compatible phones and headsets, with Android (and Google services like YouTube and Street View) at the center. “Our fundamental goal is to enable partners and developers to build great stuff,” chief Clay Bavor said, speaking Thursday to Recode Senior Editor Ina Fried at An Evening with Code Mobile conference taking place at Ericsson’s Santa Clara offices. “The headset we’re launching today, we’re using it as, ‘Hey, here’s an example.’ We’re in such early days of VR — 99.9 percent of things in VR have yet to be discovered.” “The magic starts to happen in VR when there are enough users, when there are enough devices, and most important, enough things to do,” he added. In terms of “things to do,” Daydream is focused on video content. “The real world has been strange this week, but in general, the real world is an amazing place,” Bavor said. “There are all of these incredible things happening that I would love to see and I think most people would love to see ... Everyone has something in the world that they’d like to be closer to.” Before it can become VR’s default OS, though, Google faces some tough competition. Facebook’s Oculus is making a push to be at the center of both PC-based and mobile devices with two consumer offerings: The Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR. Meanwhile, Microsoft has developed a holographic version of Windows that it’s pitching for the long-term future of PC-based virtual reality. “I was talking with the folks at Oculus, massive respect there,” Bavor said. But design choices like how users interact with a software — Daydream View comes with a Nintendo Wii-esque remote — were ready for an upgrade, he argued. recode_divider Next Up In Code Mobile Jordan Hewson says activism can be as easy as ordering an Uber Drone startup Zipline says drones are really needed for health care, not burritos Oculus mobile exec Max Cohen says mobile VR is ‘the mass market’ Zipline’s Keller Rinaudo explains why drone delivery took flight in Rwanda before the U.S. Oculus mobile exec Max Cohen says ‘millions’ have tried Gear VR Speakable’s Jordan Hewson explains why she thinks the key to promoting credible activism is in hard news Trending Why wait for a new smart car when you can update your existing one?

A group of young Chinese hackers have shown it could be an open book by cracking a Google Nexus and an iPhone within 10 seconds at a global competition, once again triggering public concern over the safety of mobile devices and applications. The Keen Security Lab, also called the Keen Team, affiliated with Internet giant Tencent Holdings, won 5,000 by hacking into a Nexus 6P in just 10 seconds and an iPhone 6s within an astonishing 8 seconds to claim the title of Master of Pwn at Mobile Pwn2Own 2016 at the PacSec security conference on October 26 in Tokyo. A Tencent public relations employee told the Global Times that the two attacks are reportedly the first time Chinese hackers have attacked these devices. According to the employee, the competition mainly aims to test the security of mobile operating systems, cellphone browsers and applications. Apple's iOS 10 and Google's Android 7.0, which are safer than previous systems, increased the difficulty of this competition but were ultimately no real barrier to the hackers. The Keen Team were also the first to successfully install malware on the Google Nexus 6P and therefore won 2,500. They also attempted to install malware on the iPhone 6s but it did not remain when the cellphone was rebooted. Finally the hackers succeeded in stealing photos from iPhone 6s by exploiting two vulnerabilities in iOS system. As China is stepping up its efforts to safeguard cyber security and fight against cyber crimes, many "white hat hackers," who hack into restricted systems and networks to assess their defenses and release reports on any vulnerabilities, have exerted more important influence and gradually come into the spotlight. Student stars For more than 10 years, the Keen Team has exposed hundreds of vulnerabilities for technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple. In September, the lab successfully hacked into a Tesla car, revealing many vulnerabilities and handing the data to the company. Apart from the Keen Team, X-lab,which is under Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc, is also dedicated to revealing weaknesses on companies' websites. Huang Zheng, a security expert at X-lab, told the Global Times that he submitted six loopholes to Microsoft last year and ranked 61 in Microsoft Security Response Center Top 100 list. This year, he climbed to the eighth spot and has submitted more than 40 loopholes in the last two years. "Windows accounts for a huge proportion of the market and even one vulnerability could lead to an enormous effect. Many malicious hackers are willing to pay high prices, for example ,000, to buy the company's loopholes," said Huang. Besides professional white hat hackers, college students have also been an important force in the country's cyber security battle. One of the most influential teams is the Azure Assassin Alliance (AAA) Team from Zhejiang University, one of China's most prestigious schools in East China's Zhejiang Province. According to the Qianjiang Evening News, the AAA Team has gathered the university's most talented hackers who major in mathematics, biology and electronic engineering. Tech talents "The outstanding achievements of Chinese hackers shows that the young generation is capable of safeguarding the country's cyber security. Their talents could further promote China in cyberspace peaceful development," cyber security expert Qin An told the Global Times. Yan Hanbing, an expert from the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team Coordination Center, said at the China Internet Security Conference in August that more than 200,000 vulnerabilities have been found since 2009, a significant chunk of which were uncovered by white hat hackers. "Along with the booming of the Internet, the market also needs public efforts to safeguard cyber security. It cannot stop hackers from revealing vulnerabilities and white hat hackers have greatly contributed to the safety of Internet development," Xie Yongjiang, a professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, told the Global Times. China's top legislature on Monday adopted a law to safeguard sovereignty on cyber space, national security and the rights of citizens. In the law, it stresses the need to launch a nationwide cyber security talent training, adding that the government will support enterprises, universities and vocational schools in this drive. However, the ambiguous legal standing of these hackers was revealed when a white hat hacker was arrested on suspicion of stealing information earlier this year. Many Internet security insiders have argued that whether or not all kinds of hacking, even benevolent hacking, should be banned needs further public discussion. Some Chinese Internet security experts have called for the government to define the legal status of white hat hackers as soon as possible.

Price $79 USD > Pricing info Tweet Email this Print this Feedback A sexier, streamlined alternative to Cardboard with plenty of potential. Most people’s first taste of VR? It wasn’t with Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Those whizz-bang headsets might make one hell of an impression, but only if you’ve got the cash to splash on a monstrous gaming PC to go with them. Nope, it was the pocket-change Google Cardboard, a DIY viewer that turned your phone into a basic, but tantalising window to the VR future. That was in 2014, but now Google is looking to take things even further down the rabbit hole. Revealed alongside the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, Daydream View is the funky headset Google hopes will further spread virtual reality to the masses. It’s hundreds of pounds cheaper than an Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or PlayStation VR setup, and even undercuts Samsung’s Gear VR. But it needs to get more than the price right to impress us. I’ve been putting one through its paces to decide if Daydream is the new king of low-cost VR. GOOGLE DAYDREAM VIEW HEADSET: SOFT, FLUFFY, AND FUNCTIONAL OK, so it’s not exactly fluffy, but compared to Gear VR’s harsh plastics and Cardboard’s… well, cardboard, Daydream view is like having your face hugged by a cloud. The headset is covered in soft fabric, with plush, comfortable innards. It’s up there as one of the most comfortable VR headsets I’ve tried - it’s lighter than either Rift or Vive, and more comfortable than PSVR. You won’t need to take off glasses to wear one, either - there’s enough room to keep your specs in place and not feel the pinch. It’s rather handsome, too, beating the Gear VR in the looks department with a fabric finish and choice of three colours. I tested the Slate version, but Snow and Crimson models will be available soon after launch. I can see that fabric finish picking up all kinds of dust and dirt over time, though - especially if you plan on chucking it into a bag for taking on the move. It’s certainly small enough to do that. The simple elasticated head strap is easy enough to adjust, and because the headset doesn’t weigh very much, it doesn’t need to be too tight around your bonce, either. It takes seconds to get a comfy fit. Can you use it for hours without feeling like an Aliens-style facehugger has assaulted your mug? Not quite. It’s light enough, even with a Pixel XL slotted into place at the front, but that soft material stops air from getting to your face. That can leave you a bit hot and bothered after a long session. You’ll be calling it quits after an hour or so - at least until you’ve developed a taste for VR. GOOGLE DAYDREAM VIEW CONTROLLER: FINGER ON THE BUTTON Daydream’s secret weapon is its bundled remote control. This is what elevates it over Cardboard and Gear VR, and makes each virtual reality experience that bit more immersive. Think of it like a mini Wii Remote: it’s packed with motion sensors so you can use it like a motion controller, and has a clickable touchpad for directional control and interaction. Two menu buttons and volume controls complete the set. You’ll want to attach the wrist strap included in the box, so you don’t accidentally embed it in any furniture or family member’s faces while you’re in VR, but otherwise it’s sturdy enough to survive a drop onto the floor. It charges over USB C (handy if you’re using a Pixel or Pixel XL, seeing as you’ll already have the right cable for charging your phone) but in the time I’ve spent with it so far, I’ve not manage to completely drain the battery. It’ll easily outlast your phone. Best of all, it slips into the headset when you’re done, so there’s no chance of losing it between VR adventures. GOOGLE DAYDREAM VIEW SETUP: IT JUST WORKS Cardboard was great because you didn’t have to plug your phone into a fiddly port (we’re looking at you, Gear VR). Google’s taken the same approach here: setup is as simple as slipping your phone into the headset, then closing it up. The elasticated clasp keeps things locked in place, so you don’t have to worry about sending your expensive smartphone flying to the floor. Once you’ve downloaded it from the Play Store, NFC tech inside the headset instantly activates the Daydream app on your phone. It saves you having to dig around the app drawer to get started. The remote automatically pairs to your phone when you first enter the app. Get disoriented, or the remote doesn’t point where you expect? Hold down the home button and it’ll automatically recenter everything, so you’re always facing the right direction. The only thing to keep in mind is that Daydream-ready phones are still in short supply. Google says they need high-resolution displays, smooth graphics and uprated motion sensors for precise head tracking, but right now, there are only a handful of phones that tick those boxes: Google’s own Pixel and Pixel XL, and the ZTE Axon 7. Other manufacturers will support Daydream once they launch Android 7 phones, but that should be next year at the earliest. GOOGLE DAYDREAM VIEW APPS: WINDOW TO THE WORLD The Daydream app begins as a cutesy tutorial, explaining how the remote works and how to interact with different VR experiences. I could play fetch with that polygonal arctic fox all day. Beyond that, it’s basically just a virtual reality menu screen, flashing huge icons for each VR-friendly app you’ve got installed on your phone or that’s available from the Play Store. It lets you buy and download new apps without leaving VR, which is great, but there’s not a massive variety available at launch. Star Chart VR (a US$5 VR astronomy guide) and the Wall Street Journal (free news reporting and 360° video) are a few of the third-party highlights. On the other hand, Google’s own apps are jam-packed with content. You’ve got YouTube for watching 360° videos, Google Photos for bringing your own 360° panoramas to life, Google Arts and Culture (a digital art gallery filled with historical masterpieces from around the world) and Street View. I’m not sure whether I’ll actually get to visit Machu Picchu, but Google’s VR version is a pretty good alternative. Cheaper, too. There’s a whole host of other apps on the horizon too, but they won’t be out before the end of the year. That means no virtual Netflix cinema just yet, but it is at least on the way. GOOGLE DAYDREAM VIEW GAMES: READY PLAYER ONE Pointing and clicking to virtually walk around the Taj Mahal is pretty cool, but the remote controller really comes into its own for gaming. You only need to hit a few holes in Wonderglade’s mini-golf game to get Wii Sports flashbacks, with the remote becoming your club. The ball physics are a bit unforgiving, but landing that long-distance putt is still super satisfying. Then you move onto the next minigame and your remote becomes a fire hose, putting out blazing buildings in exchange for theme park tokens. Yes, really. Hunters Gate is a more traditional top-down shooter, where you move your vampire hunter around the screen with the touchpad and aim with the remote. It’s a little fiddly at first, but hints at how flexible the control scheme can be with only a few buttons. Adorable puzzler Mekorama gets you to think in multiple dimensions as you help a tiny robot make his way home through levels made from Minecraft-style blocks. It’s a fun distraction, but doesn’t do a whole lot different from the other mind-benders we’ve seen on Gear VR and Oculus. A further 23 titles should hit before the end of the year, including big names like Need for Speed: No Limits and EVE Gunjack 2. Unlike the Gear VR, which is locked down to Samsung phones, Daydream will eventually make its way to other Android handsets. That’s a big incentive for developers to make games for it - so hopefully the Play Store will be filled with VR games soon. GOOGLE DAYDREAM VIEW VR EXPERIENCE: VR-OOM With a Pixel XL slotted in place, everything seemed just a tad sharper than anything I’ve seen on the Gear VR. The QHD resolution really helps here, but I wish the headset was a bit better at blocking light. There are just too many gaps around the bridge of your nose and cheeks, so you’re never completely isolated while you’re in VR. There’s no way for Daydream to calculate depth, so you can’t lean in and out of a scene like you can with Rift or Vive, but it reacts almost instantly whenever you move your head left, right, up or down. I couldn’t spot any noticeable lag or screen tearing, and you’ve got to look closely to see the pixel grid too - it’s easy to look past it and get sucked into the VR experience. Visuals aren’t console-quality just yet, but Hunters Gate still managed to impress with crisp and clean graphics. GOOGLE DAYDREAM VIEW VERDICT Daydream View isn’t supposed to give PSVR, Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive a run for their money. It’s an inexpensive headset that works with your phone to deliver VR experiences. Compromised ones, sure, but then it’s running off something that slips in your pocket, not a £1000+ gaming PC. With that in mind, Google has mostly managed to get everything right. The headset looks great, is extremely comfortable to wear, and serves up simple, easy-to-follow VR with its clever pairing system and bundled remote. Oculus and Vive won’t need to worry, but Samsung should be feeling nervous right about now. Gear VR is decent enough, but it’s tied to Samsung hardware - Daydream will be open to everyone, is more flexible thanks to that remote control, and costs less too. The headset has a few minor foibles, but if the Daydream content store can match that of Samsung's Oculus app store, Google has a clear winner on its hands.

In a blog post Thursday, Google general counsel Kent Walker said, 'Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it.' The company sent its reply on Thursday to anti-trust charges issued by the EU earlier this year over the smartphone platform. Walker said, 'The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers and mobile operators.' He noted that more than 24,000 devices from over 1,300 brands ran on Android, enabling European developers to distribute their apps to over a billion people. The European Commission sent a statement of objections to Google in April, alleging it had breached EU competition law. Google faces a fine and could be required to change its practices if the EU rules against it. Kent Walker said, 'No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone. But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone you can access a familiar set of basic services. Android's competitors, including Apple's iPhone and Microsoft's Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice in the apps that come with their phones.'

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments US Internet giant Google rejected EU allegations that it abused the market dominance of its hugely succesful Android mobile phone operating system. The rapsheet targets one of Google's most sensitive businesses, as smartphones become by far the dominant player over PCs and laptops. "Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it," said Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, in a blog. Google was responding to a long list of charges involving Android that Margrethe Vestager, the EU's outspoken competition commissioner, filed in April. They include the claim that the firm used practices such as making manufacturers pre-install its market-leading search engine as well as its Chrome browser as the default in their phones. "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosytem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers and mobile operators," Walker said. Google's response comes a week after the company rejected separate EU charges over online shopping and its advertising services in a series of rulings against US companies that has raised hackles across the Atlantic. The Android charges are seen as especially sensitive for one of Google's most strategic businesses that could alter a global smartphone sector which has taken over traditional PC's as the biggest segment in the world of computing. The case only pertains to Android-run phones, with the European Commission not considering Apple's iPhone as a factor in the case. The EU in its charge sheet accused Google of obstructing innovation by giving unfair prominence to its own apps, especially its search engine, in deals with giant mobile manufacturers such as South Korea's Samsung or China's Huawei. "No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone," Google insisted. Google is also accused of restricting manufacturers from installing rival versions or modifications of Android, an open source software operating system, on their phones. The commission, through a spokesman, confirmed the receipt of Google's official response. "As is standard practice, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation," it said.

Keeping manufacturers from releasing forks of Android as a condition of participating in the Google ecosystem – a process which Google calls “anit-fragmentation” – was also an issue.

As you might have heard, Google announced that Android Auto will no longer require a new car or a stereo system for it to work as your smartphone itself can act as its interface. To drive that point home, Google has recently started to sell the Logitech ZeroTouch car mount on its website. In case you’re learning about this for the first time, the device was announced earlier this year and if anything it seemed like a glorified car mount, but with Android Auto now being supported on smartphones, it seems that the ZeroTouch has found a new lease on life. The mounts will connect with your phone via a magnetic holder attached to your phone. Once the magnets come into contact, it will launch the new on-device Android Auto interface, whereas previously it would launch the Logitech ZeroTouch app. This means that users won’t need to fiddle around with launching apps as connecting the mounts will automate it. There are two versions being offered: a dash mount version that is priced at $80 and sits on top of your car’s dashboard, or the vent mount version priced at $60 which you can use to stick on the vents of your car’s air conditioning unit.

To build up its own ecosystem, Google is launching its developer platform in December, titling the APIs on offer ‘Actions on Google.’ The company has defined two types of actions — ‘Direct’ which is for straightforward requests that are typically used for things like home automation, media and communication and ‘Conversation’ which is for requests that require more back and forth. Meanwhile, the tech giant is also offering an embedded Google Assistant SDK that developers can use to build the AI right into other devices, like the Raspberry Pi to “mass-market consumer products.” Google Assistant was debuted at the company’s I/O developer conference this year and is used across a range of its products, including Allo, the Pixel smartphones and Google’s Alexa competitor Google Home, though it should be noted that the commands available differ based on the device.

Apple hasn’t yet copied the Google Home mentioned here or Amazon for that matter. Obviously they will copy like they do for most of their features but it’s just rumors at this point that they will produce an equivalent. As far as 3rd party integration/development, that’s been around for Google since the old voice actions even before Google Now and well before Apple bought Siri and made it worse. Brad Fortin A Google Home competitor is irrelevant to this conversation. We’re talking about the assistants, not the products that run the assistants. If third party integration has been around since before Google Now why is it absent from Google Assistant? Seems like an oversight. thereasoner If Siri is supposedly “just like” Google Assistant like you say then its smart home hub integration is very much a part of the conversation, how could it not be? Googles AI Assistant is new, it will work with everything Google Now works with and more. Being new is not an oversight, now you’re just being an immature troll. Brad Fortin Where did you get “just like” from? And did you miss the part where I mentioned “on iOS 10”? No mention of “just like” or “on non-mobile devices”. Being new isn’t an oversight, but being new without having the same capabilities as competitors or even the previous iteration is definitely an oversight. thereasoner Okay, “like” then. If Siri was” like” Assistant then where is the home hub? That and Google Assistant is not experiencing an oversight, it’s opening up in an effort to expand capabilities for current and/or future smart devices in the home. You can already do Google Home like stuff on it. Are you really this bored Brad, can’t find a girlfriend or something? Brad Fortin I don’t know why you insist on there being like hardware to compare like software. Software products don’t require identical hardware products to be comparable. You can compare Siri and Google Assistant without both needing a Home-like product, just like you can compare Google Assistant and Alexa without Alexa running on a smartphone, or like how you can compare Google Assistant and Cortana without Google having to have a video game console. thereasoner I don’t “insist” on anything, the story talks about Google Home and you said “like” Siri. So obviously I and this story is correct and Google Assistant with Google Home integration is more than just a Siri. Selective reading much? You do understand that you can’t marry Siri right?
