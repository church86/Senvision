Though a sizeable chunk of Myanmar’s internet content currently still has to be imported, a new crop of servers has sprung up that will keep some of it nearby – making it faster and easier to get to. According to American internet performance firm Dyn, both Norway’s Telenor and local company Yatanarpon Teleport (YTP) have gone live with Google Global Cache (GGC), which the American search titan calls the final tier of its content delivery platform and which involves servers that make content such as YouTube videos available for quick retrieval. Meanwhile, Japanese corporation and Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT)’s business partner KDDI Group has teamed up with its Korean subsidiary CDNetworks to establish new points of presence in Myanmar, the Seoul-based firm announced on July 22. Content delivery networks (CDNs) provide users shortcuts to content. Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Dyn, said the company brings web content closer by hosting copies of websites on servers near users, eliminating the need to connect to far-away servers. Without a local CDN operator, accessing sites like Google and Facebook necessitates linking up with servers hundreds of kilometres away, he said. And access doesn’t always come easy. “To reach content outside the country, users in Myanmar must use either SEA-ME-WE 3 or limited terrestrial links that go through Thailand and China,” Mr Madory said. “When these links are down – which happens somewhat regularly – the remaining links can get congested quickly and the total available bandwidth drops.” “Locally hosted content eliminates this factor,” he added. The arrival of an international CDN supplier, as well as Google servers, also indicates Myanmar’s internet has hit a certain landmark. “The appearance of major local hosting operations is a major milestone in the growth and development of the internet in Myanmar,” Mr Madory said. As a result of Google’s global presence, Mr Madory believes GGC is “more conspicuous” where it is absent than where it is present, and Myanmar’s new servers mean it no longer keeps company with countries such as North Korea and Cuba which lack such servers. CDNetworks’ move into Myanmar also signals progress. “The appearance of the first international CDN provider shows that the international internet community wants to be able to provide services into this new and growing market,” Mr Madory said. Yoshiaki Benino, director at KDDI’s subsidiary with Sumitomo Corporation, KDDI Summit Global Myanmar (KSGM), said that although he could not disclose a tally of servers, they are in more than one location. He said that with these servers, users could access content more quickly. “Instead of going a very, very long way to the US or wherever in the world, now they can [get] access inside the country,” he said. Mr Madory said that the advent of GGC servers will lead to faster access to Google services, including YouTube. A recent report on Myanmar’s mobile web from Telenor’s partner Opera Software ranked Google and YouTube the second- and third-most visited sites via its browser, Opera Mini. Network operators and internet service providers can ask Google to join the invitation-only GGC program, according to the company, which said it sends servers to firms after a few steps. Mr Madory said the internet in Myanmar has gone from zero to two in a short time, and 2014 brought the first phase of development – the arrival and wrangling of two new international telecommunications players. Next up is an important question for Myanmar users: “How about content?” he said. With more and more Myanmar accounts on Facebook and international sites in high demand, local hosting can help streamline internet surfing. “In the past three years we have observed a growing number of websites hosted within Myanmar,” Mr Madory said. “This bodes well for the growth of the local internet economy as well as user experience – locally hosted websites are faster to access than those hosted in other countries.” “The internet as a total system is getting more efficient ... [Myanmar is] having its little microcosm of that.” Most Read - Business "Golden City" begins to take shape Onion relief as Myanmar opens doors to imports K722 million to fund two state-owned electric power firms Will government meet target on low-cost housing?

Since the fall, Google has been conducting extensive tests in India of YouTube Go, which allows users to save videos to watch offline and monitor their data use. A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India, and will be released in other emerging markets later, company executives said in an interview. Analysts have been forecasting a surge in video consumption in India since Reliance Jio, the telecom unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, upended the industry last year with cheap data plans that have prodded rivals to lower prices. YouTube Go Now Available; Lets You Preview, Share, Watch Videos Offline Silicon Valley has long regarded India, with its population of 1.3 billion people and poor connectivity, as a prime place to test products for emerging markets. YouTube executives said they sought to build a product for Indian users from the ground up rather than releasing a slimmed-down version of their primary app. "As we talked to people in the market, they didn't want something that felt like a stripped down version of YouTube - they wanted the full experience," said John Harding, vice president of engineering at YouTube. Due to the frustration of trying to load video at slow Internet speeds, the YouTube team had contemplated showing users a series of images from a video with the audio, like a slideshow. But Indian consumers reacted poorly to the feature. The final design helps users discover videos that trending in their region while minimizing data usage. Users can preview videos before watching to ensure that is what they want. While Reliance Jio's entry has boosted video consumption in India, analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Technology Market Research questioned whether YouTube Go would remain popular as cheap data plans become more prevalent. "The only future I see for YouTube Go is for feature phones or basic phones," he wrote in an email. But with 180 million mobile users in India and mobile watch time climbing 400 percent year over year, YouTube has strong momentum in India, Jay Akkad, a product lead at YouTube, said. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Tags: YouTube, YouTube India, Apps, Android, Google, Google India, Google for India, YouTube Go, India Asus ROG GX800 Liquid-Cooled Gaming Laptop Launched at Rs 7,97,000 Apple Aims for More Control, Less Cost as It Accelerates in Chip Design YouTube Go Now Available in Beta, an 'Offline-First' App for India     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Alcatel Flash Swipe Konnect Neo 4G Micromax Dual 5 Itel Wish A41 Panasonic Eluga Ray X Panasonic Eluga Ray Max Datawind MoreGMax 3G6 Intex Aqua 4G Mini Micromax Spark Vdeo Zen Admire Swadesh Oppo F3 Plus Panasonic Eluga Pure Lava Z25 Lava Z10 ZTE Nubia N2 ZTE Nubia M2 Lite ZTE Nubia M2 Apple iPad (2017) Wi-Fi + Cellular Apple iPad (2017) Wi-Fi Karbonn Aura Note 4G Popular Sony Xperia XZs Xiaomi Redmi 4A Moto G5 Plus Samsung Galaxy S8 Moto M Oppo A57 Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Nokia 6 OnePlus 3T Lava Z25 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones Nokia Phones Gadgets 360 Hindi अल्काटेल फ्लैश स्मार्टफोन में हैं कुल चार कैमरे सैमसंग ने लॉन्च किया 8,490 रुपये वाला गैलेक्सी जे3 प्रो 4जी फोन वीवो वी5 प्लस आईपीएल लिमिटेड एडिशन स्मार्टफोन लॉन्च Latest Videos 02:41 360 Daily: Moto G5 Launched, WhatsApp May Bring UPI-Based Payments, and More 01:36 Reliance Jio Summer Surprise: Most Common Questions Answered 02:33 Moto G5: Unboxing and First Look 02:55 Destiny 2: What We Know, What We Can Expect 02:33 360 Daily: Sony Xperia XZs Launched, Xiaomi Mi Fan Festival, and More More Videos» OPINIONS ALL AUTHORS Akhil Arora How Legion Redefined the Look of Superhero TV Sanket Vijayasarathy Five Things to Look Forward to at the Samsung Galaxy S8 Launch Devika Chitnis The F-Word the Internet Doesn't Hear Advertisement Recent Uber Executive Said to Have 'No Basis' to Believe Criminal Probe Underway SoftBank Reportedly Preps Snapdeal for Sale Marvel's The Defenders Arrives August 18, Netflix Reveals With New Teaser Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy S8+ Up for Pre-Registrations in India Alcatel's New Flash Smartphone Has Four Cameras Samsung Galaxy J3 Pro With S Bike Mode Launched at Rs. 8,490 Spotify, Universal Sign Global Licence Agreement Amazon Scores Streaming Rights for NFL's Thursday Night Football Kim Dotcom's New Bitcoin Venture Is for Content Uploaders to Earn Money Amazon Drops Appeal, Agrees to Pay $70 Million for Kids' App Purchases More News TRENDING YouTube Go Now Available in Beta, an 'Offline-First' App for India Moto G5 With Fingerprint Sensor, Metal Design Launched in India Reliance Jio Summer Surprise Offer: 100GB of Free Data With These Packs Xiaomi Mi Fan Festival to Offer Redmi Note 4 at Re. 1, and More Samsung Galaxy J3 Pro With S Bike Mode Launched at Rs. 8,490 WhatsApp to Soon Let You Share Multiple Contacts at Once Xiaomi Redmi 4A Review Vivo V5 Plus IPL Limited Edition Smartphone Launched in India Xiaomi Mi 6 to Launch This Month, Confirms CEO IPL 2017: Where to Watch Matches Online, Live Stream Timings, and More Sitemaps Archives Advertise About Us Feedback Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Complaint Redressal Careers Contact Us RSS Ethics Gadgets Hindi © Copyright Red Pixels Ventures Limited 2017.

Google is watching you ;) Watching porn online? Google is watching you ;) April 05, 2017 10:51 IST When you open 100 incognito windows on Google Chrome, a smiley or winky face appears. IMAGE*: Google it seems is well aware of your online activity. Photograph: Shailesh Andrade/Reuters Whilst originally designed as a way for people to buy secret presents for their partners or to Google things they were too embarrassed for anyone to know, incognito windows are used by a vast array of people to watch porn. Yes, Google Chrome's incognito mode allows you to browse porn to your heart's content and your laptop or phone will store no evidence of it. And it appears the brains behind Google are well aware of the function's main use. When you open 100 incognito windows, a smiley or winky face appears. Instead of the normal tab counter in the top right-hand corner, users will see the cheeky face. A winky face -- ;) -- appears on Android devices, whereas iOS users see a normal smiley -- :). Google seem to be poking fun at prolific users of incognito windows but it's unclear why the faces appear. According to Mashable (a tech- and social media information site), it could be that the app wasn't designed to have more than two characters in the number of tabs field so rather than displaying three digits, they use a face instead. This is just one of many hidden features -- known as Easter Eggs -- in Google Chrome. For example, if you search 'google in 1998' in your browser, you'll be transported back to the original version of the search engine. Another fun secret trick is a game you can play when a page is taking a while to load -- press the spacebar and a dinosaur will appear. You then use the spacebar to make him dodge obstacles. There are apparently tons of hidden features of Google Chrome that are yet to be discovered. India 3rd in porn-watching in the world *Lead image used for representational purposes only.

The answer is uncertain: The country has one of the lowest internet penetration rates in the world and, so far, no very good search tools. That’s why Bindez, a local start-up, is working on it. Nurtured through Project Hub’s 2013 fellowship for entrepreneurs, the project belongs to computer science grads Ko Htet Will, 23, and Ko Ye Wint Ko, 24, who co-founded Bindez with their fellowship mentor and now CEO, Rahul Batra, 29. With a recently confirmed seed investment and a uniquely qualified team, the project is one to watch as the country makes the leap from virtually no tech to the future. “We’re trying to imagine what a search looks like if you block out the picture of having Google and Yahoo. What else could it be? Would it be just a blank page, or would it have a more intuitive approach?” Mr. Batra said, sitting at a table covered with laptops, wires and tins of snacks in Bindez’s current home office in Kyeemyindaing. Google launched its Myanmar site in March 2013 and tech watchers expect it will invest more resources here, too. Bindez said it hopes to offer users something different from the search giant. “We want to redefine the way Myanmar people consume information to progress in their daily lives,” Ko Ye Wint Ko said. Any research team faces a difficult challenge. “When you launch a search engine, you have to have crawled everything in Burmese on the net and it’s spread a lot of places … so you need a lot of time and resources spend culling the data,” said Ravi Chhabra, an adviser to the Myanmar Computer Federation. That’s partly why few have invested in similar projects so far, he said. Building search tools also requires work on Myanmar natural language processing (NLP) – the field of computer science concerned with the interaction between human (natural) language and computers – which is in its infancy relative to English, experts said. A government-run research lab opened in 2006, only to be shut down around the time Ko Htet Will finished his university courses in spring 2013. That inspired him to open their own lab, and they quickly enlisted the help of two researchers from the now-defunct government project. At about the same time, Bindez was accepted into the Project Hub fellowship, where the team was matched with a mentor, Mr. Batra, an ex-Google specialist from India who initially came to Myanmar to help an NGO work with rural youth on small-business development. By the time the fellowship ended in November, Bindez had interested a few investors and the team had dedicated themselves to the project full time. Over the next months, the team debated what Myanmar users might want. Although the English-speaking world almost takes it for granted that people want a “pull” mechanism like Google, which responds to user queries for information, in other languages, like Russian and Vietnamese, people have demonstrated a preference for tools more like Yahoo!’s “push” style of navigable subject directories. Ko Htet Will and Mr. Batra point to the success of localised search engines in other countries, in particular Vietnam, as models of what they’d like to achieve. CocCoc and Wada have both made successful inroads by offering directory-style “click” searches. Wada’s underlying technology is also able to recognise Vietnamese names quickly and easily compared to other products. So far, no Myanmar search tool is very good at turning out relevant search results. Even Google’s country site is rough and doesn’t, for example, weed out search results with obscenities, Mr. Chhabra said. “It’s actually quite ugly right now.” If an engine is going to turn out relevant results, researchers must improve the tool’s ability to recognise things like parts of speech, individual words and phrases and word meaning, which means also building resources like dictionaries and lexicons. Toward this end, so far the Bindez team has built a text corpus of thousands of Myanmar terms – research they intend to make available for open-source development of Myanmar NLP in the long term. “It’s quite difficult because the language is complex, as is digitisation of the glyphs and encoding,” said U Thar Htet, a tech expert and founder of Zwenex.com web and software development. “Without that research … the larger population cannot use [computer] systems without a second language.” Myanmar people currently input type in one of two encoding standards: Unicode, the international standard, and Zawgyi, a non-standard encoding. Currently, most of the Myanmar content on the internet currently exists in Zawgyi, making more work for the engineers of search algorithms, U Thar Htet said. Bindez said their goal is to create tools that accommodate both standards and are also customised to support local language and knowledge. “If we can really identify the content that people would like to hear and know, if we connect to our local people and provide it very much with our own ‘secret sauce,’” then Bindez could take off, Ko Htet Will said. They plan to release a private beta next month and a public beta in the near future.

Image: google/supplied By Manish Singh2017-04-05 05:38:54 UTC YouTube's new app for India's flaky internet market is finally here.  A beta version of YouTube Go app, first unveiled last year, has gone live on Google Play, the company says. Google plans to release a stable version of the app later and also intends to make it available in other developing markets.  SEE ALSO: India has the slowest Internet speeds in Asia, but things are changing slowly Unveiled at Google for India event last September, YouTube Go has been designed to work on slow and flaky internet connections.  The app offers a range of features to give users more control over how they want to consume videos. Users can save videos for offline viewing, for instance, and also select the video resolution in accordance with their internet availability. Additionally, users can also share videos between them using Wi-Fi Direct capability, a feature that the flagship YouTube app doesn’t offer. These features could come in handy for Indians. Image: Manish Singh/Mashable India Even as an increasingly growing number of Indian people are coming online, the quality of internet remains poor for most. According to a report by Akamai, only about 30 percent of Indians have a connection that is faster than 4Mbps.  Google originally planned to make YouTube Go available in India late last year, but the company says it took additional time to perform extensive tests.  "Some things we’ve learned in the run-up to this beta release include making the home screen fresher and more relevant for users, so they can find amazing videos easily," Jay Akkad, Product Manager, YouTube wrote in a blog post. "We’ve also worked hard behind the scenes to make sharing videos with nearby friends an even more seamless experience, and ensuring that the app works well across a wide range of phones and connectivity."

Play Store v7.7 prepares to roll out new security features and split notification settings to a separate screen [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 5:39pm PDTApr 4, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Warnings about installing unknown and unsafe software 1.2 code 1.3 Increased visibility of the app scanner 1.4 code 1.5 code 1.6 Dedicated settings screen for notifications 1.7 code 2 Download Google is pushing out a new version of the Play Store for Android users around the world. Like most updates to this version, there really aren't any notable changes showing up already, but there are a few interesting things hidden beneath the hood. There are some new features focused on improving security for apps that are updated from unexpected sources and making its security scanner more visible to users. There's also a plan to move notification settings to their own dedicated screen. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Warnings about installing unknown and unsafe software If you've been watching out for news about Android O, one of our spotlights covered a tweak to the classic Unknown Sources safety measure intended to prevent installation of potentially dangerous apps. It looks like there's also some momentum from the Play Store to also slow down some of the risky behavior. Some new text describes a "speedbump" intended to remind users that the source of an update they're about to install is not known or necessarily trustworthy. This actually makes the distinction between the original installer of an app, let's say the Play Store or Amazon Appstore, and the source of the update, which might be a different app store, sideloading with ADB, or installing an APK with any other app. code <string name="speedbump_settings_label">Protect my updates</string> <string name="speedbump_settings_description">Notify when apps are updated by unknown sources</string> <string name="package_speedbump_banner">Update is from an unverified source.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dialog_description">You installed this app from %1$s. %2$s is trying to update it. If you install this update, the app or your device might not work properly.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dialog_detailed_description">Updates that come from unverified sources could cause your device or apps to behave unpredictably. To keep your device stable, install updates from the same app store where you got the app from.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dont_update_text">DON'T UPDATE</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_action_view_app">VIEW APP</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_description">You'll still get verified updates from %1$s</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_title">Unsafe update blocked</string> <string name="package_speedbump_install_anyway">Install anyway</string> The warning messages feel a little misrepresentative by associating the issue with stability and improper functionality. It should focus on the nuance that switching sources may affect the consistency and timeliness of updates since they may differ from one source to the next. All the same, the wording is sufficiently ominous as to prevent most regular people from pulling the trigger. Increased visibility of the app scanner Back in the Android 4.2 days, Google began rolling out what could be loosely described as a virus scanner as a part of the Play Store, eventually making it a "constantly active." We rarely heard much about it afterward because most of the serious malware was never even allowed to enter the Play Store thanks to Google's Bouncer scanner. Nevertheless, Google continues to improve the scanner, particularly since it's still an important tool to combat malware installed from sources other than trusted app stores. A recent Play Services update already took one step to make the scanner capabilities a bit more visible with a "Verify Apps" screen with a list of recent scans. It appears the Play Store is going to take another step by giving users a viewport of its current status and more information about the results. In short, we'll be able to see if the scanner is running or if it will wait until the next time it's online, and we'll see if there are any issues discovered. It doesn't sound like much, but this really isn't much less detailed than most modern virus scanners. code <string name="verify_app_install_offline">Security scan will run when next online</string> <string name="verify_app_install_scanning">Verify apps is scanning...</string> <string name="verify_app_no_issues_found_banner">No issues were found</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning">Verify Apps is scanning…</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning_timed_out">App verification timed out</string> <string name="myapps_security_info_message">Your apps are safe.

Last daily scan %2$s. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_removed_message">Last daily scan %1$s. %2$s was removed. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> New layouts: /layout/my_apps_security_action_in_progres.xml /layout/my_apps_security_info.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha_dismissed.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha_removed.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha.xml /layout/my_apps_security_scanning_in_progress.xml /layout/my_apps_security_several_phas.xml <activity android:name="com.google.android.vending.verifier.VerifyInstallSnackbarActivity" android:excludeFromRecents="true" android:launchMode="singleInstance" android:noHistory="true" android:taskAffinity="" android:theme="@style/TransparentSnackBarTheme" /> Frankly, I'm a little skeptical that this is really going to have any impact on security since users still have no way to interact with it or make any changes. If anything, I suspect the real intent is to raise the visibility of the scanner in Android, probably for the purpose of giving peace of mind to people that only read sensationalist FUD in the news and don't know about or understand the details. While exposing the scanner in this way might not be terribly relevant, the red flags it can raise about an app are. More specifically, the messages it may show are actually somewhat specific, definitely threatening, and sometimes even quite funny. code <string name="verify_apps_block_backdoor">This app lets hackers control your device, giving them unauthorized access to your data.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_commercial_spyware">This app can be used to spy on you.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_ddos">This app can be used to perform denial of service attacks against other systems and resources.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_generic_malware">This app can damage your device, add hidden charges to your mobile bill, or steal your personal information.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_harmful_distribution">This app is being installed by another app that's known to be harmful.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_hostile_downloader">This app can download potentially harmful apps.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_phishing">This app is fake.

Dedicated settings screen for notifications The Play Store isn't particularly flush with different types of notifications. Off the top of my head, I can only think of three most of us are likely to see: pending updates, updated apps (auto and manual), and if you're pre-registering for unreleased apps and games, you'll also get notifications when those become available. It's a short list, but it seems like Google is going to add a dedicated screen for the toggles to turn them on and off. code <activity android:name="com.google.android.finsky.notificationsettings.NotificationsSettingsActivity" android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation" android:label="@string/settings_notifications_section_header" android:parentActivityName="com.google.android.finsky.activities.SettingsActivity" android:theme="@style/SettingsTheme"> <meta-data android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY" android:value="com.google.android.finsky.activities.SettingsActivity" /> </activity> There's not much else in the way of details to give about this one yet, but it seems like this screen would only exist if the developers had plans to add some additional notifications in the future.

Jacob Ha There is another change, at least for me. In the last version, when I install an app that is free / discount with "end in 5 days" for example, after I install the app, I could still see the note "end in 5 days". But with the new version, after I install the app, the note "end in 5 days" would disappear. Adam Dudash How about the new "uninstall now" notifications for apps it claims are dangerous but aren't. Like Fake GPS GO. Just because Google/Niantic is taking a stand against Mock Locations now, it doesn't mean an app that was installed from the Play Store, then removed because, I'm guessing, people were abusing it for Pokemon GO, doesn't mean it is a dangerous app and should have a constant, unswipable notification that can only be removed by disabling notifications from the Play Store.

But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year’s recipient of the AM Turing Award, computing’s version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. “It’s a crowning achievement,” Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help.” The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee’s efforts to make the Internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video – everything, really, beyond plain text – online. Spinning the Web Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world’s first website, http://info.cern.ch Besides coming up with the Web’s technical specifications, Berners-Lee “offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole,” said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he’d laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. Caught in the Web The Web’s widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the US and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the Web will become less accessible in the US if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting “net neutrality.” That’s the principle that Internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, “it’s going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realise it’s important,” Berners-Lee said. “It allowed America to benefit from a thriving Internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America.” Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the Internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a “recurrent threat.” He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn’t have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is “really important to the future of society,” he says. “As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person.” Beyond the Web Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn’t sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. “Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so it’s only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us,” Berners-Lee said. “So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences.” This is the 50th anniversary of the AM Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany’s codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the Internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web.

Unfortunately, this open-mindedness doesnt always benefit Google like in the case of Androids Google Play Games service. Given that iOS already has Game Center, the OS is not in need of another gaming service to clutter the default experience. As a result, Google has found very low usage of the service among iOS users. At the same time, it also found that Gifting, Requests, and Quests on the service were also quite low across both iOS and Android. GPGS (Google Play Games Services) will not support iOS in the latest Native DSK (2.3). Lastly, as a courtesy to game developers, Google has given a grace period of 12 months for those still using any of the (bold-marked above) aforementioned features of GPGS. Google says this is so that it can continue to focus its efforts to its other more popular features in gaming, including: Sign-in, Achievements, Leaderboards, and Multiplayer.

Since the fall, Google has been conducting extensive tests in India of YouTube Go, which allows users to save videos to watch offline and monitor their data use. A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India, and will be released in other emerging markets later, company executives said in an interview. Analysts have been forecasting a surge in video consumption in India since Reliance Jio, the telecom unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, upended the industry last year with cheap data plans that have prodded rivals to lower prices. Silicon Valley has long regarded India, with its population of 1.3 billion people and poor connectivity, as a prime place to test products for emerging markets. YouTube executives said they sought to build a product for Indian users from the ground up rather than releasing a slimmed-down version of their primary app. "As we talked to people in the market, they didn't want something that felt like a stripped down version of YouTube - they wanted the full experience," said John Harding, vice president of engineering at YouTube. Due to the frustration of trying to load video at slow Internet speeds, the YouTube team had contemplated showing users a series of images from a video with the audio, like a slideshow. But Indian consumers reacted poorly to the feature. The final design helps users discover videos that trending in their region while minimising data usage. Users can preview videos before watching to ensure that is what they want. While Reliance Jio's entry has boosted video consumption in India, analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Technology Market Research questioned whether YouTube Go would remain popular as cheap data plans become more prevalent. "The only future I see for YouTube Go is for feature phones or basic phones," he wrote in an email. But with 180 million mobile users in India and mobile watch time climbing 400 per cent year over year, YouTube has strong momentum in India, Jay Akkad, a product lead at YouTube, said.  Read More On Youtube | Alphabet Inc | Google | Google Play Store | Reliance Jio | Reliance Industries | Silicon Valley | Technology | Apps PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements YouTube Go app launched in India to beat spotty internet signals A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India Alphabet Inc's Google said on Tuesday it would roll out a mobile YouTube application designed for India, boosting the search company's presence in a burgeoning market with spotty Internet access.

Turing Award  Associated Press, 05 April 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit Photo Credit: Henry Thomas/ACM Most people who search on Google, share on Facebook and shop on Amazon have never heard of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year's recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing's version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. "It's a crowning achievement," Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. "But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help." The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee's efforts to make the Internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video - everything, really, beyond plain text - online. Spinning the Web Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world's first website, http://info.cern.ch . Besides coming up with the Web's technical specifications, Berners-Lee "offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole," said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he'd laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. Caught in the Web The Web's widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the US and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the Web will become less accessible in the US if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting "net neutrality." That's the principle that Internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, "it's going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realize it's important," Berners-Lee said. "It allowed America to benefit from a thriving Internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America." Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the Internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a "recurrent threat." He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn't have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is "really important to the future of society," he says. "As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person." Beyond the Web Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn't sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. "Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so It's only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us," Berners-Lee said. "So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences." This is the 50th anniversary of the A.M. Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany's codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the Internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web.

Google interviewed 1,100 teenagers on what they think is “cool.” If you’re over 17, you may want to buckle your seatbelt for this. If not, I doubt your attention span has held to sentence number two, so deuces. Google, apparently the authority on all things hip and youthful, has released a funky phresh report detailing what Gen Z thinks is “cool.” Teens think several Pacific Northwest companies — Nike, Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks — are “cool,” according to the very scientific and legitimate report. For the olds out there who might think “cool” means “positive affirmation,” allow Google to school you right off the bat. “Cool is an indication of what people pay attention to, what gets them excited, and can often act as a manifestation of their hope and dreams,” writes Google’s Brand Team for Consumer Apps. “Unlike millennials, this group is ambitious, engaged, and feel like they can change the world. For Generation Z, what’s cool is also a representation of their values, their expectations of themselves, their peers, and the brands they hold in the highest regard.” Ah millennials, the Gwyneth Paltrow of generations. Am I dating myself with that reference? Let’s refocus. Google asked 1,100 teens to rate brands based on their awareness of the company and how “cool” they think it is. And the results are… Cool: YouTube, Netflix, Google, Oreo, Xbox, Nike, Amazon, Apple, Snapchat, Instagram, Chik-Fil-A, Microsoft, Starbucks Not cool: The Wall Street Journal, Vice, Yahoo, Sprint, TMZ, Virgin America, McDonalds, Quicksilver Click to zoom. (Google Image) Gen Z thinks X-box is the coolest video game, while millennials are more into Playstation. Millennials like cars. Gen Z likes Uber. By way of explanation, Google offers the following tidbits about some of the top brands: “Teens go crazy for Oreos! Oreos are cool because of the variety of delicious flavors and the cute/funny marketing.” “Finding information quickly is important to busy Gen Z. They think Chrome is cool because it’s fast, reliable and easy to use.” “#netflixandchill is how teens…um ‘connect.’ Netflix is cool because it is well used, well loved, well priced, and well stocked.” Ok, who told them about Netflix and chill? (Google Image) The report also includes a helpful one-pager on positive associations Gen Z and millennials have with Google and Google products. In summary, Google says “Gen Z never knew the world before the internet — before everything you could ever need was one click away. They never knew the world before terrorism or global warming. As a result, Gen Z is the most informed, evolved, and empathetic generation of its kind. They value information, stimulation, and connection, evident by their affinity for YouTube, Google, and Netflix.” Let’s unpack that little. Ignoring the fact that studies show increased access to technology does not improve global awareness or media literacy, it seems a stretch to claim that proclivity for video streaming is evidence that this generation values connection. I’m not saying millennials are any better. Pop culture has unequivocally decided we’re the worst. Maybe we are. Maybe Gen Z is. Maybe generational studies are. Regardless, I hope you’ll enjoy reading through this report as much as I did. Google, has other aspirations for you. “We hope it serves as glimpse into the minds of the most informed and connected generation yet—Gen Z.” Nope.

Since the fall, Google has been conducting extensive tests in India of YouTube Go, which allows users to save videos to watch offline and monitor their data use. A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India, and will be released in other emerging markets later, company executives said in an interview. Analysts have been forecasting a surge in video consumption in India since Reliance Jio, the telecom unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, upended the industry last year with cheap data plans that have prodded rivals to lower prices. Silicon Valley has long regarded India, with its population of 1.3 billion people and poor connectivity, as a prime place to test products for emerging markets. YouTube executives said they sought to build a product for Indian users from the ground up rather than releasing a slimmed-down version of their primary app. (Also Read: YouTube Go: Made for India app from the ground up) “As we talked to people in the market, they didn’t want something that felt like a stripped down version of YouTube – they wanted the full experience,” said John Harding, vice president of engineering at YouTube. Due to the frustration of trying to load video at slow Internet speeds, the YouTube team had contemplated showing users a series of images from a video with the audio, like a slideshow. But Indian consumers reacted poorly to the feature. The final design helps users discover videos that trending in their region while minimising data usage. Users can preview videos before watching to ensure that is what they want. While Reliance Jio’s entry has boosted video consumption in India, analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Technology Market Research questioned whether YouTube Go would remain popular as cheap data plans become more prevalent. “The only future I see for YouTube Go is for feature phones or basic phones,” he wrote in an email. But with 180 million mobile users in India and mobile watch time climbing 400 percent year over year, YouTube has strong momentum in India, Jay Akkad, a product lead at YouTube, said.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

The decision by the full 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago comes just three weeks after a three-judge panel in Atlanta ruled the opposite, saying employers aren’t prohibited from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation. It also comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has begun setting its own policies on LGBT rights. The case stems from a lawsuit by Indiana teacher Kimberly Hively alleging that the Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend didn’t hire her full time because she is a lesbian. Google’s ad placement MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages. Google engineers, product managers and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson said they would pull their ads from YouTube, as well as Google’s display advertising business, until they could get assurances that such placement would not happen again. Fox News bias lawsuit NEW YORK — A third Fox News Channel employee has joined two colleagues in their lawsuit that says they were subjected to racial discrimination by a since-fired executive. Monica Douglas said former controller Judith Slater, who was fired Feb. 28, frequently expressed an unwillingness to be near black people. Ms. Douglas is black, as are colleagues Tichaona Brown and Tabrese Wright, who filed suit against Fox last week. Ms. Douglas, who is Panamanian, said in the lawsuit that Ms. Slater told her she wouldn’t let her dogs eat food Panamanians eat. She said Ms. Slater frequently referred to her status as a breast cancer survivor, calling her the “one-boobed girl” and the like. Ms. Douglas said she complained about Ms. Slater’s comments in 2014 and nothing was done. Also in the nation ...

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Social YouTube Go app for spotty Internet signals unveiled in India YouTube Go app for spotty Internet signals unveiled in India A beta version of the YouTube Go app has been released in the Google Play Store in India, and will be released in other emerging markets later. By: Reuters | San Francisco | Published:April 5, 2017 9:40 am A beta version of the YouTube Go app has been released in the Google Play Store in India, and will be released in other emerging markets later. Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Tuesday it would roll out a mobile YouTube application designed for India, boosting the search company’s presence in a burgeoning market with spotty Internet access. Since the fall, Google has been conducting extensive tests in India of YouTube Go, which allows users to save videos to watch offline and monitor their data use. A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India, and will be released in other emerging markets later, company executives said in an interview. Analysts have been forecasting a surge in video consumption in India since Reliance Jio, the telecom unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, upended the industry last year with cheap data plans that have prodded rivals to lower prices. Silicon Valley has long regarded India, with its population of 1.3 billion people and poor connectivity, as a prime place to test products for emerging markets. YouTube executives said they sought to build a product for Indian users from the ground up rather than releasing a slimmed-down version of their primary app. “As we talked to people in the market, they didn’t want something that felt like a stripped down version of YouTube – they wanted the full experience,” said John Harding, vice president of engineering at YouTube. Due to the frustration of trying to load video at slow Internet speeds, the YouTube team had contemplated showing users a series of images from a video with the audio, like a slideshow. But Indian consumers reacted poorly to the feature. The final design helps users discover videos that trending in their region while minimizing data usage. Users can preview videos before watching to ensure that is what they want. While Reliance Jio’s entry has boosted video consumption in India, analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Technology Market Research questioned whether YouTube Go would remain popular as cheap data plans become more prevalent. “The only future I see for YouTube Go is for feature phones or basic phones,” he wrote in an email. But with 180 million mobile users in India and mobile watch time climbing 400 percent year over year, YouTube has strong momentum in India, Jay Akkad, a product lead at YouTube, said.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Roger Siegenthaler You do know what frand is... the point of frand is so standardised systems can't be abused by the patent holders (Qualcomm)... There's nothing that apple does that should be standardised and therefore nothing they could contribute to the frand pool. Drakenoid There actually are things Apple can contribute but they don't, like their processor tech. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Funem Microsoft make money on Android phone sales due to patents. In theory they have nothing to gain from joining as they would lose they money. Syukri Lajin they are trying to put their products into android phones. and getting in good term with android makers is the first step to this. they might be losing money for the patents, but they can offset it by putting their software and services into the phone,which is also better for long term profit. the bad news for us is that we'll get more bloatware. lol Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Gerardo Sarabia Did you even read my comment? First thing I said is I know it had nothing to do with Android/PAX. YuCMi That doesn't change the validity of the rest of my comment. The beginning of your second sentence confused me, which is why I did not pick up on you saying Waymo is unrelated. Still though, your comment was completely off topic from Pax. Infringing on patents can happen involuntarily, and are more of a case of copying or reproducing. What happened with Waymo is actual theft, breaches of legal contracts, and conspiracy, among other things. Gerardo Sarabia Yeah... who cares how it happened. Either you are copying or not. Either you are open about sharing those ideas so costumers benefit from competition, or you aren't. I understand the difference, don't get me wrong, but this has been the argument Google (now Alphabet) has been giving the media and users for a long time. Now that I think about it, it actually has a lot to do with PAX, big coincidence PAX is happening now that Google is making hardware, they need freedom around those patents more than ever, not for Android but for themselves. Basically Google can get away with entering iOS/Apple's market and even use Oracle's Java in order to do so, but Uber shouldn't? I understand the difference from stealing and copying but there's clearly some conflict on these ideals. Maybe Waymo should just sue the guy that stole those files instead of Uber if that's the problem. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross.

I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel.

Amianti The Jakarta Post Jakarta | Wed, April 5, 2017 | 09:56 am Tech giant: Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt speaks to audience during the opening day of the Google Cloud Next 2017 conference on March 8 in San Francisco. The parent company of Google expects that the cloud business would serve as an alternative source of revenue for the tech giant, which has largely relied on advertising revenues. (JP/Hasyim Widhiarto) Topics Google tax Indonesia Share this article  share on facebook  share on twitter  share on google plus  share on Linkedin  share on whatsapp  comment  share on email share this article follow Us    Indonesia may need to lower its expectations in its effort to collect a massive amount of taxes from United States-based technology giant Google, as the firm’s financial report suggests that it posted a relatively small profit in the country despite local clients paying millions of dollars for its services. In financial reports prepared by Singapore-based Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. and seen by The Jakarta Post, the company, which manages contracts for advertising, service and product purchases, reported that it gained US$109.2 million in revenues from Indonesian clients throughout 2015. The company did not name any clients but suggested that its top10 customers contributed 55 percent to the total figure. Indonesia’s tax authority has pledged to step up investigations into the local operations of Google after the company refused to pay the tax arrears demanded by the government. According to Google Indonesia’s tax filing document, audited by Ernst & Young Indonesia, which was also seen by the Post, the company was subject to pay only Rp 5.2 billion (US$389,800) in income tax in 2015 based on the country’s 25 percent rate for institutional taxpayers since it only gained Rp 20.88 billion in profit that year. The 2015 profit skyrocketed by 174.7 percent from 2012 when it gained only Rp 7.6 billion in profit and paid Rp 1.8 billion in income taxes. Jakarta Special Tax Office head Muhammad Haniv refused to comment on the data. (Read also: Indonesia launches tax hunt on Google) The income tax Google paid in 2015 was a far cry from the estimates made by the Indonesian tax authority that the company owed about Rp 5 trillion in back taxes and penalties. Based on the tax office’s calculations, Google should pay its due taxes with a 150 percent penalty. Should the company ignore the government’s request, the tax authority will carry out a full investigation with a 400 percent fine, as stipulated in the General Taxation System (KUP) Law. However, before carrying out the full investigation, the tax authority has requested Google to submit reports of its transactions in Indonesia, as it operated many types of businesses in the country. The government, through the Communications and Information Ministry, has also tried to force Google and other over-thetop (OTT) companies such as Yahoo and Facebook to each set up a Permanent Establishment (BUT). As a BUT, they would each be required to report all domestic earnings from work activities in the nation and pay taxes. Haniv previously insisted that Google Indonesia was a BUT as it established in the country a “dedicated cached server”, or network server that saved web pages or other internet content locally. Google Indonesia provides assistance on Google services to clients and potential clients. In return, Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. reimbursed all expenses paid by the company with additional 8 percent profit. This explains the tiny fraction received by Google Indonesia compared to the revenues received by Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. Center for Indonesia Taxation Analysis (CITA) executive director Yustinus Prastowo said the documents submitted by Google were more accurate and legal due to being audited by an independent public accountant compared to various numbers circulated in the public without any clear basis. “These figures [in Google’s financial reports] have been officially submitted by the company, including to the Singaporean tax authority. The government should use those ones [to calculate the tax],” he said on Tuesday. By accepting the documents, the government might need to face the reality that Google actually owned a relatively small business in Indonesia, thus was not strong enough to make it into a BUT, which means that the company is subject to income tax (PPh) and could violate a tax treaty it had with Singapore. “Once it is considered a BUT, it can be a bad precedence. The government may need to step back a little because we still don’t have legal tools [for that],” he said. “We can still gain some tax money from Google anyway and change rules in the future based on [global initiative to fight tax avoidance initiated by] the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD].” Related News Government gives Google until late April to pay taxes Mounting SPT submissions expected amid approaching deadline Tax laws hit working wives You might also like : Bekasi regency leaving roads unpaved Chemical maker Clariant sets foot in East Java Police arrest escaped alleged molester House appoints new election commissioners most viewed most shared ‘The World of Ghibli’ exhibition to be held in Jakarta in August Police unveil treason plot behind anti-Ahok rally The undeniable courage of Ahmad Ishomuddin Freeport obtains eight-month special mining permit Jokowi to cut 2017 state budget again as lead up 2018 budget cuts Judges set aside edited video in Ahok’s trial KPK questions Andi Narogong Israel's history of protecting al-Assad Government to form sovereign fund for postgraduate education Fans start online petition to boycott Netflix’ Death Note live action film follow us       NEWS     JOBS   TRAVEL   LIFE   More Stories SE Asia AirAsia sets up low-cost airline in Việt Nam Academia Aaron L.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News The Number One Way To Get Google’s Attention There are still many businesses that do not have a blog, or some form of editable article format that can be referenced to in their marketing. THIS IS A MISTAKE! A big one. Either they think it’s too hard to come up with articles, or they didn’t plan for blog functionality when they built their website. YOU MUST BE BLOGGING! The benefit of having a blog on your website or funnel is so you can continually add new content to it.  Let’s look at it like this: You have a product or service and are trying to attract new customers. You have a few options to get in front of them. If you have an email list, you can email them and tell them how wonderful your product/service is and give them a link to visit it. Question: How many times are they going to be interested in receiving this before they get bored? You can post or advertise a message about your product/service, maybe using an engaging image and hope that it gets seen, let alone shared. Challenge: It needs to be unique and seriously engaging to get the viewer to click through. OR you can copy the link from your recently written article and post it to a relevant audience – by email, organic social post, or targeted social advertising. Result: They click the article snippet, or ‘read more’ link, and are taken directly to your website. However, below I focus on the component of Blogging and why it is such a critical part of your marketing. The following 5 elements of blogging are the ingredients of good blog/article content and as a result can engage your audience organically (without cost). 1 SEO Hopefully you’ve heard the term SEO, or Search Engine Optimization. SEO is the process of getting traffic (your audiences eyeballs) from the “free”, “organic”, “editorial” or “natural” search engine results. In other words, what appears in the search engines (SERP’s : Search Engine Results Page) is ranked based on what those SERPs consider most relevant to their users.  How does this relate to having blog articles on your website? Not so long ago there were many ways to get through the SEO minefield but they have evolved considerably over the last couple of years, and many won’t work anymore. The search engines have brought SEO relevance back to their control, they are calling the shots now and for good reason: They want the most relevant information presented to their searchers. 2 KEYWORDS Years ago, you used to be able to throw keywords anywhere into an article and they would get noticed, but the Search Engines have changed their algorithms so you now have to be more strategic, weaving your keywords into carefully constructed sentences. Otherwise you will be penalised by the search engines.  One thing that is still very relevant in SEO tactics is blogging. If you want to increase your websites’ traffic and visibility you must be blogging on your website. If you’re not – start now. 3 FRESH CONTENT Another change to Google, and other SERP’s, is that “fresh content” matters. New, and fresh, content gives you the opportunity to add new keywords to your website, giving you a new opportunity to be found. And almost more importantly it gives your audience (readers, visitors, users) a reason to re-visit your website. 4 SOCIAL SIGNALS Whenever you create new content on your website/blog, you must share it with your Social Media channels. The benefit here is twofold. Firstly, it gives you a broader reach through your existing audience, and Secondly it has the likelihood of being shared back through the same social media channels as well as cross-pollinating other channels. For example, if I was to share on Facebook, my post may well be shared on Instagram, Twitter or Google+. Google, and the other search engines pick up on these “social signals” and give you a higher “site authority” ranking, potentially pushing you higher up SERP rankings. One social platform you must never ignore posting to is Google+ (Google Plus). Because it’s Google’s own social media channel they are going to take notice of what is posted to it, and rank accordingly. This is a category unto itself, which I cover in detail in my Digital Content Toolbox. 5 QUALITY & QUANTITY Your posts must be relevant to your product or service and most definitely must be relevant to your audience if you want them to take notice. Feel free to include a link or two to some other relevant article or product/service whether it’s yours or someone else’s, as Google does like cross-linking. Just don’t be spammy or you will be penalised. By creating regular relevant content, you will quickly build up a good library of articles that you can refer to, recycle down the track, and re-use from time to time. Posted online content has a relatively short life so it doesn’t hurt to recycle and repost every now and then. That said, if your article is relevant to continued SERP’s it will stay high on the rankings no matter how old it is. WHO AM I? I am Rogan Carroll, a 30+ year marketer and entrepreneur, and I have opened my Digital Content Toolbox to entrepreneurs, startups, small business owners, established content managers and everyone in between. Inside the Toolbox I explain in detail how to create engaging content:- The key elements of designing good content that will engage your audience and existing customers.

We like this definition. The Global Mega Data Centers market report categorizes the market based on key industries such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. The research report represents an entirely new dimension for computing. Pune, Maharashtra — (SBWIRE) — 04/04/2017 — The Mega Data Centers Market report is a comprehensive and qualitative analysis report spread across 567 pages, 283 tables and figures categorizes the global Mega Data Centers Market based on key industries such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. The research report represents an entirely new dimension for computing. Browse Complete 283 Tables and Figures, Top 8 Companies Profile, spread across 418 pages available @ http://www.reportsnreports.com/contacts/inquirybeforebuy.aspx?name=944712 . The increasing scope of applications across different industries, manufacturing, medical, retail, game, and automotive, all industries really, is expected to drive demand over the forecast period to these unprecedented levels, reaching into the trillion dollar market arenas soon. IoT technology is in the nascent stage with a huge growth potential, and has attracted large investments contributing to the industry growth. Mega data centers represent a quantum change in computing. They are building size single cloud computing units that function automatically, representing an entirely new dimension for computing. Each building costs about $1 billion and works to manage web traffic and applications as an integrated computing unit. The Clos architecture datacenters are being put in place to manage the data from IOT. The IOT markets are poised to achieve significant growth with the use of smartphone apps and headsets or glasses that are augmented reality platforms to project digital information as images onto a game image or a work situation. The value of automated process to business has been clear since the inception of computing. Automated process replaces manual process. Recently, automated process has taken a sudden leap forward. That leap forward has come in the form of a mega data center. Order a Single or Corporate Copy @ http://www.reportsnreports.com/purchase.aspx?name=944712 . Business growth depends on technology spending that is intelligent, not on manual labor spending. The manual labor is always slow and error prone, spending on manual process is counterproductive vs automation spending. So many IT processes have been manual, tedious, and error prone that they have held the company back relative to the competition. Mega data centers get rid of that problem. The companies that invested in mega data centers and automated process for the data centers have had astounding growth, while the companies stuck with ordinary data centers mired in manual process, be they enterprise data centers or hyper scale cloud data centers with manual process, are stuck in slow growth mode. Functional automated vehicles are driving around as Uber cars in San Francisco. This is generating IoT data that is used for navigation and for transaction processing. With 200.8 billion IoT endpoints predicted to be in service by 2023, the time is right to leverage the business value of the IoT by building Clos architecture mega data centers that manage the onslaught of digital data in a manner that is cost effective." As this leap forward happened, many companies were stuck with their enterprise data center that has become a bottleneck. There is so much digital traffic that it cannot get through the traditional enterprise data center. The existing enterprise data centers are built with Cat Ethernet cable that is not fast enough to handle the quantities of data coming through the existing enterprise data center, creating a bottleneck. As these key enterprise data center parts of the economy bottleneck the flow of digital data, there is a serious problem. Companies that want to grow need to embrace cloud computing and data center innovation to correct this major problem. Robots, drones, and automated vehicles all generate tons of data, with the growth rate for IoT reaching 23% by the end of the forecast period. Trillion dollar markets are evolving in multiple segments. IoT is in the early stages of an explosive growth cycle. The Pokemon Go phenomenon raid adoption raised awareness and expectation for the vision of augmented reality AR and digital enhancement of the surroundings. Digital enhancement as IoT is just human explanation of our existing surroundings. Digital economic leveraging of data provides better management of the innate natural world and of the machines we use to perform work.

Play Store v7.7 prepares to roll out new security features and split notification settings to a separate screen [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 5:39pm PDTApr 4, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Warnings about installing unknown and unsafe software 1.2 code 1.3 Increased visibility of the app scanner 1.4 code 1.5 code 1.6 Dedicated settings screen for notifications 1.7 code 2 Download Google is pushing out a new version of the Play Store for Android users around the world. Like most updates to this version, there really aren't any notable changes showing up already, but there are a few interesting things hidden beneath the hood. There are some new features focused on improving security for apps that are updated from unexpected sources and making its security scanner more visible to users. There's also a plan to move notification settings to their own dedicated screen. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Warnings about installing unknown and unsafe software If you've been watching out for news about Android O, one of our spotlights covered a tweak to the classic Unknown Sources safety measure intended to prevent installation of potentially dangerous apps. It looks like there's also some momentum from the Play Store to also slow down some of the risky behavior. Some new text describes a "speedbump" intended to remind users that the source of an update they're about to install is not known or necessarily trustworthy. This actually makes the distinction between the original installer of an app, let's say the Play Store or Amazon Appstore, and the source of the update, which might be a different app store, sideloading with ADB, or installing an APK with any other app. code <string name="speedbump_settings_label">Protect my updates</string> <string name="speedbump_settings_description">Notify when apps are updated by unknown sources</string> <string name="package_speedbump_banner">Update is from an unverified source.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dialog_description">You installed this app from %1$s. %2$s is trying to update it. If you install this update, the app or your device might not work properly.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dialog_detailed_description">Updates that come from unverified sources could cause your device or apps to behave unpredictably. To keep your device stable, install updates from the same app store where you got the app from.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dont_update_text">DON'T UPDATE</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_action_view_app">VIEW APP</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_description">You'll still get verified updates from %1$s</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_title">Unsafe update blocked</string> <string name="package_speedbump_install_anyway">Install anyway</string> The warning messages feel a little misrepresentative by associating the issue with stability and improper functionality. It should focus on the nuance that switching sources may affect the consistency and timeliness of updates since they may differ from one source to the next. All the same, the wording is sufficiently ominous as to prevent most regular people from pulling the trigger. Increased visibility of the app scanner Back in the Android 4.2 days, Google began rolling out what could be loosely described as a virus scanner as a part of the Play Store, eventually making it a "constantly active." We rarely heard much about it afterward because most of the serious malware was never even allowed to enter the Play Store thanks to Google's Bouncer scanner. Nevertheless, Google continues to improve the scanner, particularly since it's still an important tool to combat malware installed from sources other than trusted app stores. A recent Play Services update already took one step to make the scanner capabilities a bit more visible with a "Verify Apps" screen with a list of recent scans. It appears the Play Store is going to take another step by giving users a viewport of its current status and more information about the results. In short, we'll be able to see if the scanner is running or if it will wait until the next time it's online, and we'll see if there are any issues discovered. It doesn't sound like much, but this really isn't much less detailed than most modern virus scanners. code <string name="verify_app_install_offline">Security scan will run when next online</string> <string name="verify_app_install_scanning">Verify apps is scanning...</string> <string name="verify_app_no_issues_found_banner">No issues were found</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning">Verify Apps is scanning…</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning_timed_out">App verification timed out</string> <string name="myapps_security_info_message">Your apps are safe. Last daily scan %1$s. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_title">Harmful app found</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_message">One harmful app found:</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_dismissed_message">Last daily scan %1$s. 1 harmful app found. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_several_phas_message">%1$d harmful apps found. Last daily scan %2$s. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_removed_message">Last daily scan %1$s. %2$s was removed. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> New layouts: /layout/my_apps_security_action_in_progres.xml /layout/my_apps_security_info.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha_dismissed.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha_removed.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha.xml /layout/my_apps_security_scanning_in_progress.xml /layout/my_apps_security_several_phas.xml <activity android:name="com.google.android.vending.verifier.VerifyInstallSnackbarActivity" android:excludeFromRecents="true" android:launchMode="singleInstance" android:noHistory="true" android:taskAffinity="" android:theme="@style/TransparentSnackBarTheme" /> Frankly, I'm a little skeptical that this is really going to have any impact on security since users still have no way to interact with it or make any changes. If anything, I suspect the real intent is to raise the visibility of the scanner in Android, probably for the purpose of giving peace of mind to people that only read sensationalist FUD in the news and don't know about or understand the details. While exposing the scanner in this way might not be terribly relevant, the red flags it can raise about an app are.

Dedicated settings screen for notifications The Play Store isn't particularly flush with different types of notifications. Off the top of my head, I can only think of three most of us are likely to see: pending updates, updated apps (auto and manual), and if you're pre-registering for unreleased apps and games, you'll also get notifications when those become available. It's a short list, but it seems like Google is going to add a dedicated screen for the toggles to turn them on and off. code <activity android:name="com.google.android.finsky.notificationsettings.NotificationsSettingsActivity" android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation" android:label="@string/settings_notifications_section_header" android:parentActivityName="com.google.android.finsky.activities.SettingsActivity" android:theme="@style/SettingsTheme"> <meta-data android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY" android:value="com.google.android.finsky.activities.SettingsActivity" /> </activity> There's not much else in the way of details to give about this one yet, but it seems like this screen would only exist if the developers had plans to add some additional notifications in the future.

But with the new version, after I install the app, the note "end in 5 days" would disappear. Adam Dudash How about the new "uninstall now" notifications for apps it claims are dangerous but aren't. Like Fake GPS GO. Just because Google/Niantic is taking a stand against Mock Locations now, it doesn't mean an app that was installed from the Play Store, then removed because, I'm guessing, people were abusing it for Pokemon GO, doesn't mean it is a dangerous app and should have a constant, unswipable notification that can only be removed by disabling notifications from the Play Store.

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 127/3 (19) - WI 124/8 (20) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kishori Amonkar Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Yogi Adityanath Arvind Kejriwal Home Sci/Tech YouTube introduces India mobile app for spotty Internet signals Shares1 Wed, 5 Apr 2017-10:33am , Reuters Alphabet Inc's Google said on Tuesday it would roll out a mobile YouTube application designed for India, boosting the search company's presence in a burgeoning market with spotty Internet access. Since the fall, Google has been conducting extensive tests in India of YouTube Go, which allows users to save videos to watch offline and monitor their data use. A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India, and will be released in other emerging markets later, company executives said in an interview. Analysts have been forecasting a surge in video consumption in India since Reliance Jio, the telecom unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, upended the industry last year with cheap data plans that have prodded rivals to lower prices. Silicon Valley has long regarded India, with its population of 1.3 billion people and poor connectivity, as a prime place to test products for emerging markets. YouTube executives said they sought to build a product for Indian users from the ground up rather than releasing a slimmed-down version of their primary app. "As we talked to people in the market, they didn't want something that felt like a stripped down version of YouTube – they wanted the full experience," said John Harding, vice president of engineering at YouTube. Due to the frustration of trying to load the video at slow Internet speeds, the YouTube team had contemplated showing users a series of images from a video with the audio, like a slideshow. But Indian consumers reacted poorly to the feature. The final design helps users discover videos that trending in their region while minimizing data usage. Users can preview videos before watching to ensure that is what they want. While Reliance Jio's entry has boosted video consumption in India, analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Technology Market Research questioned whether YouTube Go would remain popular as cheap data plans become more prevalent. "The only future I see for YouTube Go is for feature phones or basic phones," he wrote in an email. But with 180 million mobile users in India and mobile watch time climbing 400 percent year over year, YouTube has strong momentum in India, Jay Akkad, a product lead at YouTube, said.

Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce giant will grow its share of overall digital ad spending as it increases its number of Web searches, according to a report Tuesday from BMO Capital analyst Daniel Salmon. More and more, shoppers are taking to Amazon to search for deals on everything from Cinnamon Toast cereal to toasters — and ad dollars are following those consumers. Salmon’s report helped send Amazon shares up 1.7 percent on Tuesday, to $906.83. Google-owner Alphabet saw its shares slip nearly $4, to $834.57. Amazon’s ad business will generate $3.5 billion this year, and will grow 63 percent, to $5.7 billion, next year, Salmon predicted. By comparison, the entire TV industry books around $70 billion per year. Salmon cites ad holding company WPP Group’s decision to open an office in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle as evidence that spending will grow. WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell said in early March at a mobile conference, “The threat to Google, in my view, is Amazon. It’s Amazon and search on Amazon that is potentially the biggest threat . . . Amazon’s tentacles are spreading rapidly into all areas.” Salmon put a new price target of $1,200 on Amazon shares — while he downgraded Alphabet in a separate report. A stunning 55 percent of US consumers begin searching for products on Amazon, noted Salmon. The number last year was 44 percent, according to BloomReach. In contrast, that figure is shrinking year-on-year at other search engines and for retailers. Amazon’s voice-activated Alexa home assistant could provide yet more growth in the long term as advertisers pay to have their products touted when customers request searches, Salmon said. Amazon is “the biggest competitive headwind [for Google] since Facebook,” he said.

Device Codenamed ‘Muskie’ Found In AOSP By Corazon Victorino On 04/04/17 AT 10:16 PM Close It appears we now have confirmation that there’s going to be a successor to the Pixel XL smartphone in the near future. The codename for the larger Google flagship phone has just been discovered in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).  On Tuesday, Android Police reported about its latest discovery in Google’s Android mobile platform development initiative. Before, the tech site only found the codename for the Pixel 2 which is “walleye.” But now the codename for the larger next-generation Pixel is present in the AOSP as well. After looking for new information in the open-source platform, the tech site found the codename “muskie.” Walleyes and muskies are types of fresh water fish found in North America. Google is known for using names of fish for its smartphones. Last year, before the Pixel and Pixel XL were outed to the public, they were swimming in various rumors and reports with their codenames sailfish and marlin. Let’s not forget that even the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P were known internally as bullhead and angler before they were launched. The two new codenames are being linked to the successors of the current Pixel phones. Basing on the sizes of the walleyes and muskies, the latter is believed to stand for the larger Pixel XL 2. READ: Google Pixel C has a new look  Another codename present in the AOSP is “taimen,” which is part of the salmon family. Very little about this third codename is known as of late. When it was first spotted in mid-March, it quickly stirred speculations that it could be the working title of a third-generation Nexus 7 tablet. Techies are also not ruling out the possibility that this could be another phone. If it is, then it could be the largest handset out of the three upcoming Google devices.  Unfortunately, there are no details to confirm that these codenames really stand for the aforesaid devices. No information about the phones and the possible tablet is available as of this time. Taiwanese company HTC is expected to be the manufacturer of the next-generation Pixel devices. However, Android Headlines has learned that other companies like LG, TCL and Coolpad are trying to secure contracts to build the new devices as well.  Google’s next-generation Pixel smartphones may have just been confirmed thanks to codenames that appeared in the AOSP.

Play Store v7.7 prepares to roll out new security features and split notification settings to a separate screen [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 5:39pm PDTApr 4, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Warnings about installing unknown and unsafe software 1.2 code 1.3 Increased visibility of the app scanner 1.4 code 1.5 code 1.6 Dedicated settings screen for notifications 1.7 code 2 Download Google is pushing out a new version of the Play Store for Android users around the world. Like most updates to this version, there really aren't any notable changes showing up already, but there are a few interesting things hidden beneath the hood. There are some new features focused on improving security for apps that are updated from unexpected sources and making its security scanner more visible to users. There's also a plan to move notification settings to their own dedicated screen. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Warnings about installing unknown and unsafe software If you've been watching out for news about Android O, one of our spotlights covered a tweak to the classic Unknown Sources safety measure intended to prevent installation of potentially dangerous apps. It looks like there's also some momentum from the Play Store to also slow down some of the risky behavior. Some new text describes a "speedbump" intended to remind users that the source of an update they're about to install is not known or necessarily trustworthy. This actually makes the distinction between the original installer of an app, let's say the Play Store or Amazon Appstore, and the source of the update, which might be a different app store, sideloading with ADB, or installing an APK with any other app. code <string name="speedbump_settings_label">Protect my updates</string> <string name="speedbump_settings_description">Notify when apps are updated by unknown sources</string> <string name="package_speedbump_banner">Update is from an unverified source.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dialog_description">You installed this app from %1$s. %2$s is trying to update it. If you install this update, the app or your device might not work properly.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dialog_detailed_description">Updates that come from unverified sources could cause your device or apps to behave unpredictably. To keep your device stable, install updates from the same app store where you got the app from.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dont_update_text">DON'T UPDATE</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_action_view_app">VIEW APP</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_description">You'll still get verified updates from %1$s</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_title">Unsafe update blocked</string> <string name="package_speedbump_install_anyway">Install anyway</string> The warning messages feel a little misrepresentative by associating the issue with stability and improper functionality. It should focus on the nuance that switching sources may affect the consistency and timeliness of updates since they may differ from one source to the next. All the same, the wording is sufficiently ominous as to prevent most regular people from pulling the trigger. Increased visibility of the app scanner Back in the Android 4.2 days, Google began rolling out what could be loosely described as a virus scanner as a part of the Play Store, eventually making it a "constantly active." We rarely heard much about it afterward because most of the serious malware was never even allowed to enter the Play Store thanks to Google's Bouncer scanner. Nevertheless, Google continues to improve the scanner, particularly since it's still an important tool to combat malware installed from sources other than trusted app stores. A recent Play Services update already took one step to make the scanner capabilities a bit more visible with a "Verify Apps" screen with a list of recent scans. It appears the Play Store is going to take another step by giving users a viewport of its current status and more information about the results. In short, we'll be able to see if the scanner is running or if it will wait until the next time it's online, and we'll see if there are any issues discovered. It doesn't sound like much, but this really isn't much less detailed than most modern virus scanners. code <string name="verify_app_install_offline">Security scan will run when next online</string> <string name="verify_app_install_scanning">Verify apps is scanning...</string> <string name="verify_app_no_issues_found_banner">No issues were found</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning">Verify Apps is scanning…</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning_timed_out">App verification timed out</string> <string name="myapps_security_info_message">Your apps are safe. Last daily scan %1$s. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_title">Harmful app found</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_message">One harmful app found:</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_dismissed_message">Last daily scan %1$s. 1 harmful app found. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_several_phas_message">%1$d harmful apps found. Last daily scan %2$s. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_removed_message">Last daily scan %1$s. %2$s was removed. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> New layouts: /layout/my_apps_security_action_in_progres.xml /layout/my_apps_security_info.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha_dismissed.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha_removed.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha.xml /layout/my_apps_security_scanning_in_progress.xml /layout/my_apps_security_several_phas.xml <activity android:name="com.google.android.vending.verifier.VerifyInstallSnackbarActivity" android:excludeFromRecents="true" android:launchMode="singleInstance" android:noHistory="true" android:taskAffinity="" android:theme="@style/TransparentSnackBarTheme" /> Frankly, I'm a little skeptical that this is really going to have any impact on security since users still have no way to interact with it or make any changes. If anything, I suspect the real intent is to raise the visibility of the scanner in Android, probably for the purpose of giving peace of mind to people that only read sensationalist FUD in the news and don't know about or understand the details. While exposing the scanner in this way might not be terribly relevant, the red flags it can raise about an app are. More specifically, the messages it may show are actually somewhat specific, definitely threatening, and sometimes even quite funny. code <string name="verify_apps_block_backdoor">This app lets hackers control your device, giving them unauthorized access to your data.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_commercial_spyware">This app can be used to spy on you.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_ddos">This app can be used to perform denial of service attacks against other systems and resources.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_generic_malware">This app can damage your device, add hidden charges to your mobile bill, or steal your personal information.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_harmful_distribution">This app is being installed by another app that's known to be harmful.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_hostile_downloader">This app can download potentially harmful apps.</string> <string name="verify_apps_block_phishing">This app is fake.

It will even point out if an app might attack non-Android devices, and especially any device running Windows. (Hey, Microsoft... You're welcome?) Dedicated settings screen for notifications The Play Store isn't particularly flush with different types of notifications. Off the top of my head, I can only think of three most of us are likely to see: pending updates, updated apps (auto and manual), and if you're pre-registering for unreleased apps and games, you'll also get notifications when those become available. It's a short list, but it seems like Google is going to add a dedicated screen for the toggles to turn them on and off. code <activity android:name="com.google.android.finsky.notificationsettings.NotificationsSettingsActivity" android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation" android:label="@string/settings_notifications_section_header" android:parentActivityName="com.google.android.finsky.activities.SettingsActivity" android:theme="@style/SettingsTheme"> <meta-data android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY" android:value="com.google.android.finsky.activities.SettingsActivity" /> </activity> There's not much else in the way of details to give about this one yet, but it seems like this screen would only exist if the developers had plans to add some additional notifications in the future. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

In the last version, when I install an app that is free / discount with "end in 5 days" for example, after I install the app, I could still see the note "end in 5 days". But with the new version, after I install the app, the note "end in 5 days" would disappear. Adam Dudash How about the new "uninstall now" notifications for apps it claims are dangerous but aren't. Like Fake GPS GO. Just because Google/Niantic is taking a stand against Mock Locations now, it doesn't mean an app that was installed from the Play Store, then removed because, I'm guessing, people were abusing it for Pokemon GO, doesn't mean it is a dangerous app and should have a constant, unswipable notification that can only be removed by disabling notifications from the Play Store. Vincent I still haven't received the new look.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

The administration is increasing scrutiny on H-1B visa applications for low-level computer programmers, focusing enforcement on the heaviest users of the programme, and warning applicants not to discriminate against American workers. The size and scope of the programme remains unchanged for now.  There are 85,000 H-1B visas distributed through a random lottery each year, and applicants rush to file by the start of the process, this year on April 3. Outsourcing firms often recruit lower-skilled workers through the programme, so they may not get as many visas under the new rules. That means more for everyone else, including US tech giants. What some see as a crackdown may actually be a boon for these companies, according to Rod Bourgeois, head of research at DeepDive Equity Research. “If Indian firms have a harder time getting basic programming jobs approved for the visa process, then the firms truly hiring people with high skills and specialised knowledge will benefit,” he said. See which countries get the most H-1B visas. Alphabet Inc.’s Google told some of its workers on Monday not to worry about the changes, saying its software engineering roles don’t fall into the job categories included in the administration’s new guidance. Other big US technology companies didn’t say anything publicly. That’s tantamount to a round of applause compared with the industry’s reaction to Trump’s executive orders restricting immigration from a handful of Muslim-majority countries. Dozens of companies supported lawsuits against the orders. When the first one was issued in late January, Google told some staff to return to the US in case they couldn’t get back in later, and thousands of employees protested. Carl Shusterman, a former attorney for the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service, called the H-1B changes “a subtle threat” against outsourcing companies.   Seven companies had more than 1,000 visa applications for the lowest-level computer programmers certified by the Department of Labour in 2015, the last year for which numbers are available. All of them provide outsourcing services, such as IT, HR, payroll and accounting, for other companies. One of them — HCL America Inc. — is headquartered in the US, with most of the rest based in India. “The top 15 job shops are all pretty much all from India. They get 85 per cent of the H-1Bs. If they cut that number, then the American firms will get the bigger slice of the pie,” Shusterman said. “A lot of the Apples or Googles are paying over US$100,000 (RM443,150) a year. They’re going after top talent. This memo is really going after the lowest paid people.” The American technology industry is happy to go along with the framing of H-1B reform as a matter of cutting down on bad actors. “If you’re taking that out of the system you’re able to take the programme back to its true stated purpose,” said Michael Hayes, government affairs manager for the Consumer Technology Association, in February. “Removing the abuse lets you see what the future needs of the system are.” He declined to comment on the recent changes. Silicon Valley companies say they use H-1B visas differently than outsourcing firms. Their common refrain is that its bad policy to let foreign students earn advanced degrees from the best US universities, then send them away to work in other countries. But that’s not the main use of the programme. Ron Hira, who studies immigration policy at Howard University, shared analysis with Congress last year that looked at the H-1B programme from 2005 to 2012. Only two of the top twenty H-1B recipients over that time used more than 10 per cent of their visas to employ people who held PhDs. About one-third of Intel Corp.’s H-1B workers held doctorate degrees, while Google was second with 12 per cent. A majority of H-1B workers employed by Apple, Microsoft and IBM didn’t hold higher than a bachelor’s degree.  The administration or Congress may yet find a way to make more sweeping changes to the H-1B programme that would disrupt how the largest US technology companies use the programme. There are a handful of members of Congress vying to alter the H-1B programme. But because the visas are handed out once a year through the lottery system, the time for such action has passed in 2017. Like the big US tech companies, most industry policy experts kept quiet on this week’s changes. They’re keeping their powder dry ahead of any bigger changes before the visa rush next spring. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit opens higher against US dollar China becomes US’ biggest oil buyer as exports hit record Kim Dotcom announces new Bitcoin venture for content uploaders to earn money Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Activist targets GM share structure, board Second Australia miner declares force majeure in wake of Cyclone Debbie Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Malaysia confident US will continue with visa waiver programme, DPM says Embassy refutes news report on visa-free travel to US Zahid: US tightens visa waiver rules for Malaysians after terror attacks in Europe, Turkey Malaysia confident of acceptance into US VWP, says Zahid US enforces new visa rules on some travellers with Mideast ties Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

It's not the company you think Richard Read Reporter Email This Page Your Name Your Email To (separate emails with commas) Message (optional) Send Your email was sent successfully. Close April 4, 2017 When you think of self-driving cars, you probably think of Tesla and its well-known Autopilot software. Or perhaps you think of Uber and its recent troubles with autonomous tech. Or you might just think of Waymo (formerly, Google's autonomous car program), which has been working the longest and most effectively on completely self-driving cars. But none of those are positioned to win the autonomous car race. According a new study published by Navigant Research, Ford is the true leader in that field, followed closely by General Motors.  Yes, despite all the hype around Silicon Valley funding and prowess, Detroit is showing the upstarts how its done. And for at least the next few years, Ford and GM should continue leading the pack. Methodology To reach its conclusions, Navigant looked at ten criteria: "vision; go-to market strategy; partners; production strategy; technology; sales, marketing, and distribution; product capability; product quality and reliability; product portfolio; and staying power." Clearly, Navigant believes that dominant forces in the self-driving car market need more than the technology to make vehicles stay in their lanes, stop at intersections, and brake for pedestrians. To be successful, companies also need ways to promote those cars; to distribute them across the country and around the globe; and ultimately, to sell those vehicles to eager consumers. And that's where Ford and GM shine. They may be old guard, they may not have the sparkle of new companies like Tesla, but they know how to build and sell cars. They've been doing it for decades.  You can see how major players in this field stack up in the graphic above. As for Navigant's ranking of self-driving car winners, here are the top ten: 1. Ford 2. GM 3. Renault-Nissan Alliance 4. Daimler 5. Volkswagen Group 6. BMW 7. Waymo 7. Volvo/Autoliv/Zenuity 9. Delphi 10. Hyundai Motor Group Room for others at the top? To be fair, those rankings could change over time. As Tesla's gigafactory begins ramping up production, the company could churn out increasing numbers of vehicles. Though its goal of manufacturing 500,000 cars next year is remarkable, that's still just a fraction of what Ford and GM produce. And of course, without a network of dealerships, Tesla is working at a disadvantage when it comes to selling its cars.  Waymo has no plans to sell cars. Instead, the Google spin-off is hoping to license its self-driving software to established automakers. It's entirely possible that some companies may take up Waymo on its offer, especially automakers that haven't invested much time or energy developing their own autonomous technology. (Case in point: Fiat Chrysler, which has provided some minivans for Waymo's test fleet.) To date, however, those offers haven't come flooding in. And Uber? Like Waymo, Uber doesn't intend to build and sell self-driving vehicles. It's banking on an autonomous car revolution that will alter conventional ideas about transportation, vehicle ownership, and even cargo shipment. It seems clear that such a revolution will eventually occur, but when remains a mystery--as does Uber's right to use its possibly purloined current technology.

If your eyes can stomach the bright colours and scrapbook design of someone who seems to have read about what teenagers like in a textbook, then Google's latest research provides some interesting insights. Turns out that those aged 13-17 (Generation Z, for those keeping up) really like Google, Netflix and Xbox, but are not so fond of WhatsApp and Yahoo. The research comes in the form of a magazine entitled “It's Lit: A guide to what teens think is cool” and will make happy reading for those higher up in Alphabet, if they can get past the gaudy colours and lack of spreadsheets. In all, Google was the third coolest brand, with Google-owned YouTube in first place. And Chrome somehow managed to bag a top ten finish, just edging out Amazon and Apple. The rest of the top ten was rounded out by Netflix, Xbox, Oreos, GoPro, PlayStation, Doritos and Nike. And as for the least cool brands? Well, TMZ, The Wall Street Journal, Sprint and Yahoo could do with working on their next generation of customers, if they want to have a next generation of customers. Though to be entirely fair to The Wall Street Journal, it's probably best to wait for some of them to enter the financial services sector and then check again.   The study involved asking 1,100 teenagers aged 13-17 to rank 122 brands by coolness and awareness. One 17 year old girl from Florida purportedly explained her love of Google in such a way that would surely see her writing up the research one day: “Google is really cool because it is an innovator. A trend setter. Google is not only a powerful search engine, but great at everything it does, from email to documents.” That sounds like the kind of thing I'd have written as a 17 year old, but unsurprisingly people weren't queueing up around the block to find out what I thought was cool. So this may seem like a fairly unimportant study in the greater scheme of things, but what's interesting about it is that it shows a generational shift in how brands are perceived between millennials and our current batch of teens. Brands that are losing ground between generations include HBO, PlayStation, WhatsApp McDonald's, Uber, Tesla – and car brands in general. You can read the full findings here.

Adsense is one of such opportunities and it is free, easy to use, one can get 68 per cent revenue from it. Simply put, AdSense is a program run by Google that allows publishers on the Google network of content sites to serve automatic text, image, video or interactive media advertisements that are targeted to site content and audience. These advertisements are administered, sorted and maintained by Google. They can generate revenue on either a per-click or per-impression basis. Rich content website AdSense loves content-rich websites. Content can be of any kind (including text, images, videos), provided it does not violate the AdSense content policies. It is suggested though to have text content on the pages so that the AdSense crawler can understand what the website is about. AdSense is more suitable for websites that publish articles, case studies, how-to guides but there are also success stories of other types of websites as well. High-quality website It is not enough to publish content that does not violate AdSense content policies but you also need to provide  high-quality content on a high quality website. Google is liable to advertisers for the money they pay so they don’t want their ads to appear on low-quality websites. In the past this was possible but in the last couple of years they have put up more policies on the type of websites on which you can run AdSense. Lots of traffic AdSense is a good way to make money online and it is perhaps the easiest method, provided one has a good amount of quality traffic coming to the website. There is no fixed amount for the earnings because the amount of money one can make depends on the earnings per click (EPC) and click through rate (CTR), but it is not advisable to run AdSense on websites that have less than 300-400 unique visits per day. In general though, the more targeted traffic there is, the more money one can make with AdSense. Target the right keywords If the right keywords in the content are targeted, one can make more money with AdSense or with any other advertising platform. What are the right keywords? Keywords are: (1) used by advertisers to promote their products, so the competition is greater and this raises the earnings per click (EPC) (2) action keywords, action keywords are more effective since the users are more likely to ‘take action,’ that is, convert after they click. Let us look at the following example: Assume that there are two websites in the weight loss niche that are running  AdSense. Both websites receive the same amount of organic traffic and they have ads in the same positions. The first one is getting visitors searching for “weight loss tips”, “how to lose weight”, “lose belly fat” and the other one is getting traffic from keywords like “why drinking water is important”, “what to eat after dinner”, “how many meals to eat per day”. Compliance with AdSense policies AdSense represents 1/4th of Google’s revenue so they take the whole program very seriously. While it is relatively easy for everyone to get an AdSense account, if one does not  play 100 per cent by the rules, one risks losing the account. Even if one is an existing or new AdSense publisher, make sure the policies are read and understood before implementing AdSense on the website. Remove from your mind any ideas for tricking the system and always remember that they have hired the best people to make sure that nobody will be able to bypass their rules and policies. Websites with a purpose and not a MFA (made for AdSense) website While AdSense is a great way to monetise a website, websites that are made for the sole purpose of running AdSense ads are not favoured by Google.

Most Of Us Don't Need A Fitness Tracker David Nield Apr 5, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple fibit fieldguide fitness trackers google health and fitness wearables Share Fitness trackers aren't what they used to be. The fad gadget you strap to your wrist has seen a precipitous fall in the last year. Pebble closed its doors after releasing a solid fitness tracker, and Fitbit has struggled (though we liked its new Fitbit Alta HR). There's also the fact that fitness trackers, while great for athletes, seem to not actually help most of us lose weight. Image: Fitbit Which means if you're desperate to track sleep or steps or how many calories you consume you might be better off sticking to your phone. If you've taken a dive into your phone's fitness apps lately, you'll have noticed it can track your steps, your runs, and even your sleep without any help. So really, what's the point of buying yourself a separate wearable? Maybe your phone is enough tracker Image: Apple All contemporary smartphones come packed with sensors, which help it sort out where you are on a map, what orientation you're holding the phone in, and so on. It turns out these tiny components can do a lot of fitness tracking, too. Both Google Fit and Apple Health, depending on your choice of OS, are capable of keeping tabs on the steps you've taken, the distance you've covered, and the calories you've burned as you make your way about your day. Image: Google Google Fit is the more fitness focused of the two platforms, as its name suggests. Try adding an activity and you get a hundred to choose from, including everything from water polo to backcountry skiing. A lot of these activities can only be tracked in a very loose way, but the options to record them are there. Apple Health gives a more rounded picture of your health, and while it doesn't have quite as many activity categories as its Google counterpart, it goes into more detail and depth. For example, it includes the option of tracking caffeine intake and glucose levels. Image: Strava What apps do you need to turn you phone into a tracker? You don't necessarily need another device to keep tabs on a lot of these extra measurements, but you do need extra apps. There's a pile of apps, from Strava to Runkeeper, that can measure walks, runs, and bike rides using only your mobile phone, and in a lot more depth than your phone's own software can. (Both Strava and Runkeeper can share data with either Google Fit or Apple Health if necessary.) Image: Sleep As Android And an app such as Instant Heart Rate Monitor (for iOS or Android) can measure your heart rate using the technology built into your phone's camera. It might not be as accurate or as comprehensive as using a device strapped to your wrist or your chest, but it can add new depths to your health tracking, and the apps come with plenty of useful options for analysis and assessment. Apps can use your phone's sensors to figure out just how much quality shuteye you're getting as well. Sleep as Android can judge how restful for night has been for Android, while Sleep Cycle is one of the best options for iPhones or iPads. That's a lot of data you can keep on top of using nothing but your phone and a well-chosen app or two, though admittedly, there's more manual input involved if you want to go beyond the basics of step counts and sleep times, and it will definitely drain your phone's battery a little faster. Yet, as your phone is usually always with you, you may not need that separate tracker. Why you might still want a fitness tracker Image: Fitbit If you do decide to pay extra for a dedicated fitness tracker, the first benefit you get is portability: you don't have to lug a 15cm phone around on your morning jog, because a snug wristband or a tracker clipped to your pocket is doing all the tracking for you. With many smartwatches now including GPS, you can track your location too. Smartphones might feel like extensions of our natural bodies these days, but for some high-intensity activities you really don't want to take your phone with you. From running around on a soccer pitch to doing laps of the pool, the more advanced your fitness activity, the more a dedicated tracker starts to make sense. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And by fitness tracker we also mean smartwatch with advanced fitness tracking capabilities — being able to glance at your wrist as you hit the home straight of a 5K run is much more convenient than trying to fish your phone our of your pocket. The latest fitness trackers also bring more sensors and more accurate sensors to the table: whether it's the continuous heart rate tracking of the Apple Watch or the altimeter, barometer, and compass built into the Garmin Fenix 3, you can usually expand on the monitoring capabilities of your phone with a dedicated wearable. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo That often translates into less time spent manually inputting data — if there's one sticking point likely to interfere with your fitness tracking goals, it's having to enter data manually. It's a job that just never gets done, or doesn't get done often enough, and you don't have to worry about it if you're wearing a device that knows the difference between a gym session and a jog without being told. Of course there are a wide range of fitness trackers out there, some of which do a better job than others at keeping tabs on what you're doing, but generally speaking you get more automation and more detail with an extra device to help your phone along. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And all that's before you get to the app and software that comes with your tracker, which you may well prefer to the built-in offerings from Apple and Google — Fitbit's bundled app is particularly handy and gives you a detailed breakdown of your stats on the web as well as on your phone. The big downside to a fitness tracker? It's another gadget you'll need to be charging every day (or week), and the majority of trackers are big ugly rubber bands. Those are nearly as aesthetically pleasing as a smartphone in your back pocket. WATCH MORE: Science & Health News Comments Almost Guest Apr 5, 2017, 10:59am To me they are only for general interest as I doubt anyone needs a fitness tracker. (Elite athletes would have a swarm of coaches and trainers monitoring them.) I suspect that owning one makes you feel like you're taking your fitness seriously when in fact you've done little to nothing. Reply 0 vangrat @vangrat Apr 5, 2017, 11:07am I both agree and disagree. When I first started losing weight, I had nothing but my phone to rely on. This was a great place to start though. I could track my calorie consumption and steps throughout the day. However, as I got further along my fitness goals, the phone just wasn't cutting it anymore. As such, I got a Blaze. The Blaze allowed me to take the next step, tracking my calorie consumption and burn throughout the entire day. Thus allowing me to better manage my macros, and ensuring my fitness goals were being met. Could I have done that without the Blaze, probably. Would it have been as easy, nope. That's what the fitbit does for me, it makes my fitness tracking easier. Moreover, it acts as a constant reminder to stay fit. It's right there on my wrist, I look at it more times an hour than I care to figure, and it's alerts to stay active keep me on my toes. If you use these smart watches the way they were intended, e.g. tracking calorie burn, heart rate, and physical activity, you will get more than you would from just using a phone. However, the key is that YOU, yourself, and no one else, have to WANT to get fit. If you just strap on the watch and expect to lose weight/get thin/get a beach body, you're deluding yourself. The watch is there to help YOU monitor YOUR fitness, not do it for you. Reply 0 CookingMama @cookingmama Apr 5, 2017, 11:11am I just upgraded from the charge hr to the blaze. I love it! Reply 0 CookingMama @cookingmama Apr 5, 2017, 11:19am GPS tracking is a battery hog, and if you're already using your phone for music (esp streaming or using bluetooth headphones), you can kiss your battery goodbye if you're heading out for a long workout. I love my fitbit because it really helps with the incidental exercise. It reminds me to take the steps, to go for a longer walk at lunch. The Active Minutes are the one to track for weightloss. I need to be hitting around 60 active mins a day if I want to see changes. And now, I have the pretty pretty pink and gold blaze. As a watch, it's pretty good. Reply 0 friendly_Foe @friendky_foe Apr 5, 2017, 12:29pm No one needs a fitness tracker. People have been loosing weight before fitness tracker. If you want to loose weight its simple... "Eat less move more. Eat everything but more fruits and veggies, less meats and even less sweets." Why over complicate a simple solution to a big problem. Eat only this, eat within a certain time, count this and count that. Blah Blah Blah. Now you track every calorie and every move you make and connect devices to you 24-7. If you have noticed you put on weight over the years is because of your lifestyle choices. You can blame your kids, career or metabolism. But the truth is people get lazy and they find things to blame other than themselves. Kids are always running about you should too. If your career is busy walk to the station or to work or park a little further away. Worried it's your metabolism? Don't because it doesn't change through out your life. Be selective with the foods you eat. Don't switch out wholesome foods for something in a pack. The real health isle in the supermarket is the one where you find the oranges and broccoli not the isle with the overpriced fake food. Nothing beats a carrot and bok choy. Change your lifestyle and your body will too. It's that simple no fitness tracker required and it's free!!!!! Reply 0 friendly_Foe @friendky_foe Apr 5, 2017, 12:33pm The only people who need to do do all these fancy things are athletes and movie stars where they need their bodies to be at a certain way. But for the average Joes and Janes nothing could be easier.

Reply 0 shadowlee @shadowlee Apr 5, 2017, 12:56pm Using your phone as a daily step counter makes sense if you keep your phone in your pocket. Unfortunately, women's clothing manufacturers keep insisting that women don't need pockets so my phone mostly lives either on my desk or on my bag. That makes it less useful for step counting. Reply 0 R3 @rthree Apr 5, 2017, 2:02pm I found out yesterday that my Samsung Gear Fit 2 integrates with Strava. This is an exciting concept. Might go for a walk now to test it out cos it just told me I've been inactive for too long. If only it could remind me when it's beer o'clock. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Streaming music came not long after -- Spotify was founded in 2008, and competitors were close on its heels. In 2017, the answer you'd get could not be more different. Vinyl is cool again, as much as it ever has been if not moreso. The power of the internet, too, is changing the way that vinyl records are thought up and sold. Equal Pay Day Is A Good Reminder Of How Much It Still Sucks To Be A Woman In Tech Libby Watson 05 Apr 2017 12:30 PM Today is Equal Pay Day in the US, which is so chosen because it marks, on average, how much longer a woman would have to work to make the same as a man did during the previous year. Women across the US are... well, not quite "celebrating", but marking the day with events and protests, and probably more than a few private grievances about their overpaid male colleagues and bosses. But while the pay gap pervades most occupations, it's often particularly pronounced at higher income levels -- which many jobs in tech are. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter? Subscribe Have a tip?

As noted in a report from Recode, Google has informed employees that it doesn’t expect “an impact to Googlers.” Samsung U28E590D 28-Inch 4K Monitor In the email, Google’s HR team explained that its software engineering rolls don’t fall into the fields mentioned in the new United States Citizenship and Immigration Services guidelines. “Wanted to quickly weigh in on behalf of the immigration team to let you all know that we’re following this and for now, don’t anticipate an impact to Googlers,” says the email to Google staff from an employee in human resources. “Our software engineering roles don’t fall into the job categories included in the USCIS’s [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] new guidance. We’ll continue to watch the H-1B visa space closely and keep Googlers updated on any changes they need to be aware of.” Since the campaign, the Trump Administration has promised to overhaul immigration with a new “American First” policy. The approach has raised a variety of concerns in Silicon Valley due to the large amount of talent that comes from foreign countries. However, the new regulations don’t make it impossible for companies to hire foreign talent. The USCIS has explained that companies will simply have to detailed proof that the position the foreign worker will take is “complex, specialized, or unique,” and that it cannot be filled by an American worker. Following Trump’s immigration ban, Google worked with employees to ensure that they were safe and accounted for, while demonstrations were also held around at various Google campuses in protest of the legislation.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 56 Plus 1 on G+ 152 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares294 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD Adrian Meredith Hmm what? Vr is incredible can't go back to playing elite on a 2d screen Jesse Lee You must be using Daydream VR and not Oculus because you would have realized you're comment is complete shit. George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.)

Sorry to break it to you. But cardboard was out in June of 2014. Gear vr didn't get released until like november of 2015. Over a year later. And at that time, it was basically just a plastic google cardboard. Willie Chalmers III Well, Cardboard was introduced at I/O in May 2014, and Gear VR was released in November 2015. Daydream was released in November 2016. Does that make it any more fair? It doesn't matter if it's fair, I'm just explaining Google's options. I'm not happy about the prospects, but I noted that Google could make Daydream a requirement for GMS at the risk of an antitrust lawsuit. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) they couldn't even if they wanted to the daydream requirements are hardware specific and most phones don't meet them. Willie Chalmers III The phones already support the hardware necessary for Daydream, and Google meant EXISTING phones wouldn't support Daydream when they announced it. Google said that most new Android phones could very easily support it. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Not that simple. For example The G6 can't support it. Not because it doesn't have a screen and a gyroscope like daydream's cardboard cousin but because the LCD panel isn't capable of the fast refresh times needed for VR on that scale. I know that many of you think the gear VR is just like cardboard but it's more like a poorman's oculus. Daydream is on the same playing field as the Gear VR sure but that doesn't mean existing phones or even new ones can join the party. is every phone going to abandon LCD? I don't see that happening just yet. Willie Chalmers III Okay, I didn't realize the G6 doesn't have the hardware requirements to support Daydream, but there is (mind you) likely no reason besides an ulterior motive for the S8/S8+ not to have Daydream support. Could there be hardware requirements that the S8/S8+ don't support? Absolutely, but Daydream can already be enabled and used with the phone by editing a config file as root.

Willie Chalmers III Yeah, I noted that. That's the unfortunate reality of corporate politics. JohnyNoLegs Maybe since Samsung comes up with everything great in Android, Google should be the one using Samsung rather than the other way. Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Kawshik Ahmed Google can't implement Gear VR to Android because it's not Open Source rather it is own by Oculus/Facebook. If a OEM share their technology with AOSP, Google have no problem to implement it, take for example Sony, who shared 50+ enhancement in Android O alone. X-47B or think Google - who don't add even the latest google search to AOSP. Is latest chrome, google assistant part of AOSP? Samsung shared KNOX with google, which they are not supposed to. Kawshik Ahmed Chrome has it's own Open Source form named Chromium so it doesn't need to be with AOSP. Anyone can use it like Opera and many others are doing. Google Search and Assistant are not features or enhancement nor part of the actual OS, they are services and it takes money to maintain the servers to run them. I don't think any company will make their services open sourced. It's like saying Samsung should open source Bixby which will never happen. blueman24 That would be good only if samsung made any polished software plus made it open source. JohnyNoLegs Google can't even do that so not sure what you are inferring. illregal Said no one ever. Samsung is a disease. Holding back true innovation with their lackluster devices. Diogo Neves Yeah, the competition really looks fierce for Samsung lol illregal buying reviews, paying to badmouth your competition, marketing dollars and dumbasses eating it up doesn't mean the device is any good. It means you've been had. JohnyNoLegs Sounds like Apple to me haha. Pixel isn't far behind... Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Chris Sanner that's...nice? but it means lock-in - if I'm on a nexus/pixel and I leave for a samsung phone...I lose what content I had. if I decide that's fine and move to samsung, if I want to leave and go back to a pixel I lose the content. that means I have to be willing to bet that I will *always* buy Samsung. and guess what - I'm not. Anthony820 And when I switch to Canon I lose all my Nikon lenses. And when I switch back I lose all my canon. And went I switched from iPhone I lost all my apps and had to re-purchase them for a new OS. I say everyone fully endorses their competition's ecosystem of services/products. Chris Sanner um...except this is like someone making a canon-based camera and refusing to support the new cannon attachments on the next release. that's kinda shitty and would be enough to keep me from buying the cannon-based camera OligarchyAmbulance "Miles ahead" lol ok Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. MJ I am not sure why Samsung VR is so funny and... No updates for you huh? Are you one of those people still using Windows XP on their PC? JohnyNoLegs Samsung be is available for customers of Samsung, and it's far better than Daydream still. And no I'm on pixel xl running 7.1.2, but really it's the same as 7.0 so no benefit of having pixel for the past 5 months. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. Ra1nb0wD4sh DE I would totally get a HTC Vive, but it's too expensive atm. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They want you to use GearVR MJ Yes, which is the opposite of giving customer choice aka what they may want. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Corporations don't care what you want Rob Cook Your argument is invalid, Samsung isn't forced to provide Daydream as they have developed, in their opinion a superior alternative. The customer choice here is to not buy Samsung if you feel that Daydream is the better product (arguably it's not). You logic is saying that Samsung MUST provide Daydream as well or there isn't a choice being offered at all. That's like saying that Cheverolet MUST offer a V12 quad-turbo in the Corvett because Bugatti offers one in the Chiron. Yes both are cars but that's it. MJ Ummmm The argument I never made is invalid? OK... Dude, I never said Samsung should be REQUIRED to provide Daydream support. I did infer Samsung should should give their customers options. LOL I do agree about NOT buying Samsung products. It is amazing to me all comments defending Samsung on this. Who doesn't like options and prefers a walled garden? Oh yeah... Your analogy was really stupid by the way. What I am saying is the what Ford does with their touch screen system in supporting Apples' CarPlay and Android Auto is better way to go than just supporting one or the other or using a proprietary only system. Jesse Lee Well then why didn't Google offer Oculus support on its Pixel phones....no customer support needs I guess. This was a no-brainer, I thought anyway but.... Dave I will not buy a S8 without Daydream. I was going to finally buy my first new phone since the Note 2, but now think I will wait for the Pixel 2. Mike549 They're losing my purchase of an s8 because of it. I already have the s7 with gear VR but I want access to Daydream too. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They chose not to support it because they are not idiots. Why would they risk losing VR market share? MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. illregal Samsung copied google here.. There's no debate, gear vr came out way after cardboard. samsung pay, etc.. All out after google. Samsung hasn't had an original thought in years, unless it has to do with ripping off their idiot customers. JohnyNoLegs I didn't know Cardboard had sensors in it..... I thought it was just a piece of cardboard with a lense... dhamp2g Cardboard was 1st dude!!! JohnyNoLegs Then VR with actual sensors and lag free use came out... DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. illregal oculus is proprietary crap and losing badly to vive. Kwetsima Maluleke Is it? Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Ryan IMHO Gear and daydream provide the very same experience in term of quality. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Mike549 Verizon stores have Daydream devices for demo purposes. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. Klark Kenneth Wait, are you saying it's a fail or are you saying "No? FAIL."? MJ "Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL." What the hell is that supposed to mean? Jesse Lee Dude, stop trolling. Nexus phones were made by Google, the N6 was less then 2 years old when Daydream VR came out and Google didn't even support it. Yet, you're comments seem to contradict that reality and keep bashing Sammy when Google's support is much much worse when it comes to VR. You're barking up the wrong tree is how the expression goes and its apparent from reading this section. MJ Speak about trolling... The OP statement I quoted made so sense so I asked him to explain it. What does that have to do with you buddy? Daydream is NOT supported on the Nexus 6? So what? You need minimal hardware support for a good experience so it's better than something like Cardboard. FACT: Samsung’s first consumer Gear VR headset didn't support any previous Samsung phones either. FACT: Goggle Daydream is open to other OEMs while Samsung's VR solution is NOT. Now go away... Mike549 Agreed. I think the same applies to the Rift and Vive for exclusive too. Ryan The most targeted platform is Cardboard... ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Sudev Together but not the same :) Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. Ryan I disagree it's a bit like the console/PC war non sense. While I understand people might want to only experience it on PC for obvious reasons there are a lot of smaller players that are enjoying mobile VR a lot. While it's true there is a lot of crap in the store there are some really good games. Jon Fridman VR on phones doesn't look anywhere near as good based on experience. Consoles are irrelevant to this as well because they still don't have the raw power a PC can (yes thst includes the PS VR headset). While the graphics may look decent, they can't compare to higher end systems. Once VR has matured I think it'll be fine to use on phones. In the current state I cannot see a reason to use a VR headset. I won't buy one for my PC either despite having a more than capable set up (i7 6800K/EVGA 1080FTW/32GB RAM). When the next generation comes out I'll likely buy one. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol op12 Daydream expanded beyond the Pixel a while ago... https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/#daydream-ready-phones Jesse Lee Yeah, it works great on any phone now named Pixel Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Atoqir Well that is saying like "Why do my PS4 exclusives don't work on Xbox" There is always some artificial lockout to make a platform more attractive. And I don't think it's a bad thing. It makes competitors do better and create the best platform for the biggest chunk of users. And the least popular loses and doesn't have a vibrant ecosystem. Look at Windows Mobile as prime example. Cause we are not talking about regular hardware products anymore. These days every products is a weapon the "wars of the ecosystems/platforms" Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Ryan VR is not pleasing for everyone.But there are a lot of people that love it. kalehv Oh I love it too. but there's not much to do yet. Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR. Ryan And this is why, as a VR Dev , I only target cardboard for now. Hope the VR future will be brighter and easier for everyone! It is a really good medium. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So you'd rather target a limited audience rather than a large one? How is this a good business decision? darkvadur 1 April??..... Sudev Together but not the same :) Mike549 I was going to get the S8 if it supported both platforms but not now. I'll just keep my S7 and get a Daydream compatible phone if an interesting one comes out soon. Sean Thomas to be fair...daydream is bad. I haven't used Gear VR, but Daydream isn't worth it right now if they already have a platform with more support. Daydream shouldn't be on par with oculus if it's bad tbh. Google should just work with oculus to make an android-wide deal. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Serious question: Does the Pixel / Pixel XL support Gear VR? Jordan L probably not, I'm guessing Gear VR is a Samsung exclusive thing. Whereas Daydream is available to all. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Isn't Gear VR the same VR as Oculus? If so, it's not Samsung exclusive. Jordan L I don't know. I thought it was called Samsung Gear VR. Oculus has a VR framework that is available to cell phone makers? If that's true, then Daydream should work work that, I agree. A big part of Daydream was the ability for other companies to join in. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I googled it. Yes, Samsung Gear VR is powered by Oculus. So it's probably going to have the most content, which is what will make it the most successful VR. If it turns out Daydream gets the most content, then I'm sure Samsung will support it. Otherwise they'll lose customers. This is no different than prior format wars like Betamax vs. VHS or HD DVD vs. Blu-ray. Whoever gets the most content wins. Jordan L Fragmentation. Google allows all companies to attempt to do Daydream... so Samsung does their own thing. Chris Sanner Dear Samsung: this sort of shit is why I refuse to buy any more of your phones. like, ever. dhamp2g WTF this type of shit kills me. Why wouldn't google make it required to use android?????. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Why does it bother you? If Daydream wins the VR competition, then Samsung will either lose customers or be forced to support Daydream. If Gear VR wins, then Google and Daydream phones will either lose customers or be forced to support it. That's the way the free market works. dhamp2g bc I bought a daydream when it was on sale bc I though 4sure that the s8 would support it. I will get the next pixel when it comes out and ditch my s8 and use my s7 for gearVR. I wanted one phone for both. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck with that! I don't care about VR, but if I did, I'd get the phone that supports VR with the most content. That's what determines the end game. Suicide_Note VR is crap, and anything that speeds its demise is fine by me. https://media0.giphy.com/media/d4aTnvQuF6xyfgWI/giphy.gif kgptzac Anyone with a brain should not find this surprising, and should be easily see the reasons behind it. Once again the burden falls to developers to either make exclusives, or games that support multiple VR platforms. It's not unfair either... developers have always been choosing between sony and microsoft on consoles, and google and apple on mobile, so it's fair game. likurges daydream is a gimmick. useless crap in it's current form. On the other hand samsung is an ass for not supporting it Averix No great loss. VR is a fad for right now. The lack of content makes that obvious. Since they're giving away a headset for the Samsung Oculus experience, I don't think Daydream matters much here. Jesse Lee "Could" be Samsung's deal with Oculus?! Absolutely it has to do with the competing VR platform offered by Oculus. I guess I never would have thought they were going to and never got hopes up for it just the same as I never thought the Pixel was going to include Oculus software, kind of a no-brainer really. Jordan L It's possible the Samsung could support both VR's, and maybe Oculus is elusive to Samsung? So pixel couldn't support both platforms. If that's true, then one could hope Samsung would support both.(it was a long shot). Daydream is open to all manufactures... Is Oculus?

By John Lincoln John Lincoln is co-founder and CEO of Ignite Visibility, a digital-marketing teacher at the University of California San Diego and an online-marketing consultant. @johnelincoln Co-founder and CEO, Ignite Visibility@johnelincoln WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement If you have an app that you'd like to rank in the search engine results pages (SERPs), it's important that you understand the relevant ranking factors. Otherwise, you're just wasting your time. In this article, we'll go over the importance of app optimization and explain how you can make sure that your app appears in the SERPs. Why You Need to Optimize It's important to optimize your app for the various search engines because a recent report shows that 27% of users find apps with a web search. That's up from just 2-3% in 2014. Expect that upward trend to continue. Also, keep in mind that Google is putting on emphasis on app downloads from search results and downplaying Google Play. Even though, at this point in time, 40% of people still find apps by searching in an app store, it's still important to optimize your app for the stragglers who use Google web search for everything. Finally, keep in mind that Google has gotten better at ranking apps over the past couple of years. That's good news for search engine optimizers who want to use Google's search algorithm to push their apps higher in the SERPs. The App Pack Of course, when people talk about "apps," they're talking about mobile apps. That's a reality not lost on Google. As a result, Google now features an app pack at the top of mobile search results. If you open a browser on your mobile device right now and search for "photo editor," you should see the app pack at the very top of the search results. The app pack can include one, three, or six apps. If there are more than six apps that match the search criteria, the search results will display an arrow at the bottom of the pack so that users can view more apps. Each app in the pack not only displays the app title, but also its rating and its price. If a user clicks on the app square, the underlying operating system will open the app in the app store. Keep in mind that app pack results are specific to the operating system. That means only apps that work on the user's mobile platform will be displayed. How the App Pack Impacts Your Brand If you optimize your app so that it appears in the app pack, you could adversely affect your brand presence in the SERPs. That's because for every app that appears in the pack, one web ranking is pushed off the page. So if your website is ranking at the #1 spot right now for a specific keyword and you optimize your app for that same keyword so that it appears in the app pack, your site will be pushed down lower in the SERPs. That's something you want to keep in mind as you begin your optimization efforts. Mistake #1: Not Using the Right Keywords One of the first steps to any optimization effort is to determine the right keywords. App optimization is no different. When people search for an app, they're usually searching based on a descriptive noun. For example, "travel planner" or "photo editor" are phrases that describe apps frequently search for. So when you begin your optimization efforts, think about what your app does and come up with a few words or phrases that people might use when searching for it. Mistake #2: Not Optimizing the Title and Description Google treats the title of an app similar to how it treats a title tag on a web page. Google also treats app descriptions as on-page text on a web page. That's why it's a great idea to include the aforementioned keywords in your title and description. You'll have to do that when you submit your app to the OS-specific app store. Of course, you'll likely want your title to be branded. But if there's enough room for a keyword in the title (for example, "PhotoBomb - A Photo Editor") then include it as well. Finally, keep in mind that standard rules about keyword usage apply here. Avoid over-stuffing keywords into your description just to rank higher. That strategy will likely backfire. Mistake #3: Ignoring Reviews Reviews of your app matter for two reasons. First, Google might rank your app based on keywords from user reviews on the app page. As with traditional SEO efforts, keywords towards the top of the page are given the most weight. Also, the star rating of your app will have an impact on its rank as well. It's possible that an app with the keyword that's only in the description might outrank an app with the keyword in the title because it has a higher star rating. Of course, the star rating might also impact the click-through rate. If your app has only a couple of stars, don't expect too many people to click on it. Mistake #4: Ignoring App-Specific Keywords One of the best ways to move ahead of your competition when it comes to ranking your app is to optimize for app-specific words. For example, use the word "app" in your title or description. While it's not likely that anyone searching for an app in the app store will include that word in the search query, people who are using Google to search for an app are very likely to do so. Also, include the operating system of the app in the title or description. Again, people searching on Google Play for an app probably won't include the word "Android" in their query, but folks who are using Google search could do so. Wrapping It Up Application SEO Moving your app to the top of the SERPs is no different than moving your website to the top of the SERPs in this way: it requires acting on the right information. Today we just touched on the most basic mistakes. There is a lot to know about this topic and many advanced strategies that you can pursue.

The hashtag #20PercentCounts links to the YouTube channel Lean In, where a video entitled “#20PercentCounts: See what 20% less looks like” begins automatically playing. (Photo: Google Screen grab) “What if women received 20 percent less…of everything?” asks the video, which is a collaboration of Lean In, Funny Or Die, and Hulu. In the video, a woman whose phone has 20 percent of its battery left receives a text message, but her phone dies before she can answer it. Two other women complain when they receive less coffee; a man proceeds to get a full cup. In the final skit, a male boss offers a woman a job and then tells her she’ll be making 20 percent less than another colleague. Lean in describes itself as “an initiative of the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation to empower women to achieve their ambitions.” The video does not include research showing that the so-called wage gap only makes sense if hours worked, years of experience, and education of male and female laborers are considered, as highlighted in Forbes. Men major in nine out of the top 10 best-paying majors, according to Observer. Furthermore, politicians and activist groups often propagate the idea of a gender pay gap, but do not point to specific companies that are discriminating against women, as pointed out by the American Enterprise Institute.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article.

Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

Google Maps will now remember your route preferences when searching for directions Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 4:08pm PDTApr 3, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 131 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Applications Google News Most of us rely on Google Maps to find directions when we don't know the way ourselves. Maps defaults to showing you the fastest route based on the data it has at its disposal. Although, maybe that's not the way you want to go. There's some good news if you always have to set preferences for routes like avoiding highways or tolls. Maps now remembers them. Until now, you had set your avoidance options (tolls, highways, or ferries) every time. That gets annoying if you live near something you want to consistently avoid. Users of Maps have been asking Google to do something about this for years. There's a post in the AOSP bug tracker from 2011, as well as several from 2013 in the product forums. Well, now Google has listened. Here's what Google reps have said about the change. Google Maps users wanted the ability to save their preferences when looking up directions (avoiding tolls, ferries, highways, etc.) in Google Maps. Now you can! On your Android phone or tablet, your settings are now saved automatically. They will be remembered the next time you use Maps. It looks like this change went live in the last few days, so give it a shot on your device. We've tested, and the settings under "Route options" are saved between sessions. So, you only have to choose which routes you want to avoid once. That also means you have to turn it back off if you want the fastest overall directions again. Most people will probably prefer it this way, though. Download: Google Maps (Play Store) Tags app updates apps directions Google maps navigation subscribe ...

So when it went live for me they sent an email saying it has been added and thanks for feedback. Paul_Werner Noticed this over the weekend and I'm glad it did since I was around Chicago. I always try to avoid the toll roads there Victor Stuber Still waiting for option to use HOV lanes and have maps calculate trip time with it. TomsDisqusted Annoying is a vast under-statement, this has meant either fiddling thru menus while driving or just giving up on using google navigation for those of us who live near toll roads that we don't use (some require expensive subscriptions). This has been a problem for many years and has problem caused many accidents. demarcmj You could always fiddle through the menus before driving. Like right after you plug in the address. Colin Richardson It has the ability to turn it self back on during driving.. There is a spot near me where a major road splits near a bridge.. GPS/Maps will often get confused and think you are on the incorrect road and will start the "Re-routing" phase.. It will eventually work out you are not on the incorrect road and then re-route back.. (Which is nice).. But what it doesn't tell you is that due to the re-routing, it had forgotten you had selected "Avoid Toll Roads". And guess what is just another 3 miles up the road.... Very annoying. demarcmj Very interesting. I would think those settings would've persisted through re-routing, even if they didn't get saved from one session to another. That's Google for ya. Iamsecond That isn't that bit on the M6 is it? Because it does exactly the same to me there! Colin Richardson Indeed, it is the M6. From ~J1/J2 towards B'ham Patrick Huynh Pham does this carry over to Android Auto as well? matteventu Yes, the Google Maps in Android Auto is just an instance of Google Maps with the overlay of Android Auto. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Effing finally. iOS has had this for ages and it was annoying to suddenly be sent through tolls the next time I navigated the same route. dariusmoss it's actually been like this for some time.. pretty sure i mentioned it in a comment here a couple weeks ago. maybe server side switch?

Screwed me over before. Andrexx That would be "Avoid Tolls," right? roberto.elena I think SVTCobra is ok with roads with tolls, but wants to avoid specific lanes on them. SVTCobra No these roads run with the regular highway which you can pay to use to skip the traffic. demarcmj The purple sign above the lane isn't enough indication? SVTCobra I had it take me onto a toll road via an ez pass entrance only. I don't recall seeing the signs until it was too late. 2×4 Learned this the hard way yesterday JW Finally! Now where are the speed limit signs? JPLoureiro As far as I know, some routes show the speed limit while others don't. Colin Richardson Apparently it is subject to availability data. It seems in the US, the method for retrieving Speed Limit information is pretty much bespoke from State to State with varying degrees of completeness and accuracy. Maybe it is worth them testing such systems on a Smaller country.. The UK for example.. *Hint Hint Google* JW But Waze which is also Google's and have that feature universally.

It is totally nuts when you think that google is all about "we know what you want even before you know you want it". roberto.elena Maybe you didn't want it enough... until now :) jurrabi Probably I didn't know I didn't really wanted it until now... but Google did ;) v1nce Wow. Only took this great company YEARS to do. Thanks guys! Can we have speed limits now please and an option to change the voice? Ed. Blake I still dont get why GMaps and Waze can't have the same goodies. lgg4 People are ice skating in Hell right now. HoomanB About time! JustTIC about freakin time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Joseph Seboek Took a loooooong time to get this. The app is getting better on a lot of fronts. Can't find a better point of interest directory embedded in a navigation system I think. Unfortunately, Maps strength is not in the primary reason for its existence. Constantly loses where I am, thinks I am on a road I am not, gives wrong directions, doesn't recognize new roads and exits. I just can't trust the thing. Oddly enough, Waze is spot on. Does not have all the bells and whistles that Maps has but it does not get me lost! Always has the new exits and roads.

They use the platform to route 20% of their internet traffic - a number that continues to grow since it's initial deployment two years ago. Over the last few years, I've observed SDN move from carriers to large service providers and now enterprises. Google says it's this tech that lets them deliver near real-time responses to voice search and other services that depend on low latency. One of the drivers behind Google's decision to use SDN was the need to build a network that could handle products and services that haven't yet been conceived. By using software to automate and orchestrate changes quickly, they are able to adapt to changing needs. There's some interesting background and technical information on Google's Official Blog but I think the big takeaway is the need to deploy infrastructure that is adaptable.

However, thanks to a number of great resources that have recently been put online for free, teaching yourself to code has never been easier. I started learning to code earlier this year and can say from experience that learning enough to build your own prototype is not as hard as it seems. In fact, if you want to have a functioning prototype within two months without taking a day off work, it's completely doable.

The interface could pave the way for an emerging crop of Ethernet chips that aim to disrupt Broadcom’s dominance in the sector. “Right now there’s no standard API for switches so when plug in a new switch, we do that work ourselves,” said Amin Vahdat, technical lead for networking at Google, in an interview with EE Times at the Open Networking Summit. The interface is just one of many missing puzzle pieces for Web giants and network operators migrating to software-defined networks (SDN). Google and AT&T both reported progress on their decade-long shift from networks based on ASICs and vendor-specific protocols to ones running functions in software on generic servers and switches. The effort to plug a new switch into a data center network is “dramatically different” than inserting a new server, Vahdat told EE Times. “That really holds back the market,” he said, adding he hopes to rally a group of chip vendors and customers to define the new interface within a year. Today, Broadcom’s chips are used in more than 90 percent of Ethernet switches. Cavium’s XPliant has gained design wins at Arista and Brocade, and AT&T announced it tested chips from startup Barefoot Networks among others. Meanwhile startup Innovium and Mediatek spin-out Nephos are vying for a slice of the market with established players including China’s Centec Networks, Marvell and Mellanox. The rising competition is expected to drive down switch prices from recent highs of $60 per 100-Gbit/s port, or almost $2,000 per chip in 2016. But big users such as Google need a common API and test suite for qualifying the new switches. “We want to support a range of switches, [but] now we have to do a fair amount of work to integrate [them],” Vahdat said. In addition, the new chips need to provide hardware support for detecting and routing around network faults. Although the new chips do a good job “pushing the envelope of speed, [they] take a single-switch view of the world,” he said, calling for chips that cooperate across a network of many switches from multiple vendors.

Image: google By Adario Strange2017-04-01 17:38:09 UTC April Fools' Day is the only "fake news" day that's almost welcome. Almost. And one of the longstanding masters of the tech prank, Google, is at it again with a fresh batch of trickery.  This year, the jokes are more obviously fake this time around in what appears to be an effort to avoid anyone actually thinking these products actually exist.   SEE ALSO: 15 office prank ideas to show your coworkers who's really the boss Nevertheless, some of these products would be kind of cool, despite how wildly impractical they are.  Here's the running list of what Google's "rolled out" today so far: Google Gnome   Although the name rhymes with the very real Google Home, this imagined Google digital assistant is instead designed to sit outdoors and help you out with all matters related to weekend backyard lounging and the occasional bit of garden work.  Delivering information bits about weather, edible plant life and a surprisingly dark array of opinions, Google Gnome is what Google Home would be like if it showed up in an episode of Black Mirror — helpful, but just a tad too ominous with its robot apocalypse leanings.   Haptic Helpers   The quickest way to get a tech-centric laugh nowadays is to show some idiot fumbling around while blinded by yet another new VR headset. But Google smartly goes in another direction and actually addresses an issue that has yet to be solved in virtual reality: haptics.   Haptic Helpers actually brings human Google workers into your home to assist you with your VR experience by providing you with all of the other sensory input that you can't otherwise get on current VR Systems. From smell, to taste, and even touch, Haptic Helpers show us the next best solution for full VR immersion until we actually have holodeck-level sensory input.   Google Wind   Stepping up the April Fools' Day game to a new level, Google's team in the Netherlands came up with an imaginary system called Google Wind that links the country's 1,170 windmills together using "machine learning [that] enables all the mills to collaborate." Once those windmills are linked, they are able to literally blow clouds out of the sky to allow the country to have more sun-filled days.   Somehow, as ridiculous as this one looks, it's reminiscent of the very real weather modification initiatives that have been documented in years past. Nevertheless, the special effects showing people being blown away by the power of the windmill mechanisms adds just the right amount of whimsy to let you know that Google is in fact just playing around with yet another wild "what if" idea. Google Puchi Puchi Keyboard    Also getting in on the international prank fun is Google Japan, whose team came up with perhaps the most ingenious fake gadget in a keyboard made of bubble wrap. The Puchi Puchi keyboard (in Japanese, "puchi puchi" translates as bubble wrap), allows the user to simultaneously enjoy the feeling of popping those tiny plastic bubbles included in packing materials while typing out a message.   Once the message has been popped out, a Puchi Puchi reader rolls over the popped material to decipher the message. Yes, this is stupid. But for some reason, I actually want this. They even added a special version of the Puchi Puchi Keyboard that releases pleasant fragrances when you pop the bubbles, including air from places like Hawaii.  Someone please actually make this. Google Cloud on Mars  Definitely one of the biggest pranks on the list is Google's claim that it is launching a data center on Mars in 2018. The data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," is designed as an off-world backup in case Earth experiences some sort of catastrophe.     Image: google "By opening a dedicated extraterrestrial cloud region, we're bringing the power of Google’s compute, network, and storage to the rest of the solar system, unlocking a plethora of possibilities for astronomy research, exploration of Martian natural resources and interplanetary life sciences," reads the very long and detailed blog post accompanying the April Fools' gag.     They even went as far as creating a data center location on Google Maps that you can explore.  And while this may be a joke now, it's not unrealistic to imagine a very real Google data center on Mars in the decades ahead as companies like SpaceX work to colonize the red planet.      Google Maps Ms. Pac-Man Finally, Google updated an old Google maps twist from 2015 by re-introducing its Pac-Man Google Maps game. In the current updated version on Android and iOS, you play Ms. Pac-Man using a map from anywhere in the world.  Image: GOOGLE It's obvious why Google decided to rehash this one, it's incredibly addictive and deserves another look. Find your own neighborhood and try playing "just one" game and putting it down.   So far, this looks like all the April Fools' Day weirdness Google has up its collective sleeve, but we’ll keep our eyes open out for any new ones and add them as we find them.

The Arctic Eider Society’s SIKU project to harness and preserve Inuit traditional knowledge using state-of-the-art digital tools will receive $750,000 in grant funding and hands-on support from both Google and their local support partner, the LEAP Centre, for the next year to help them bring their projects to life, Google Canada announced last week. “We’re really excited,” said Joel Heath, president of the Arctic Eider Society. “Our project is called SIKU, which is the Inuktitut word for sea ice and we’ve been basically bringing together the best of technology to benefit the Inuit.” (click to listen to the full interview with Joel Heath) Listen EN_Interview_3-20170404-WIE30 SIKU is an Inuit knowledge wiki tool and a social mapping platform, said Heath. Users can contribute to profiles as well as tag photos and comments with profiles for sea ice types, wildlife, traditional place names, using Inuktitut terminology in various dialects, Heath said. It also has a mobile app that allows users to take GPS-referenced photos and tag them to help mobilize Inuit observations on the land and out on the ice, he said. “Each of these profiles will be like a Wikipedia of Inuit knowledge, bringing together these different tools and services to help with safety on the ice and knowledge transfer, documenting Inuit observations over time and mobilizing that knowledge,” Heath said. Users of the platform can sign up using their Facebook accounts or emails. “It will be basically a social media for Inuit, by Inuit,” Heath said. The project started as a prototype for the community-driven research programs in the southeast Hudson Bay – James Bay area. “Whenever the hunters are out doing work – like a salinity profile or taking ice core samples – the results of the work would show up on their profiles,” Heath said. “So it will be a way to manage the data, for one, but to keep track, so that hunters in different communities could see the work they’ve contributed to and to see the work that’s going on in neighbouring communities.” That allows the communities to get involved in the research and interpret the results in their own knowledge system, he said. The team behind SIKU is also working to cross-reference all the sea ice terminology in various Inuktitut dialects to preserve this essential linguistic and survival knowledge, Heath said. “So the profile for the type of ice would have all those different Inuktitut dialects as well as the Canadian Ice Service term,” Heath said. “And depending where your profile is from, it would show your dialect first.” SIKU project team (left to right) Phillipe Blais, Lucassie Arragutainaq, Joel Heath, Misha Warbanski and Kristen Kownak © Arctic Eider Society In the short term the online tool will allow hunters to share safety and travel information, he said. For example, if an experienced hunter encounters dangerous ice conditions, he can take a photo of that ice and tag it with GPS coordinates to warn others less experienced hunters to avoid the area, Heath said. “But in the long term it’s also documenting changes over time,” Heath said. “The more you document those ice conditions, then you have a long time series showing how the ice has changed.” The Arctic Eider Society is also using the results it received from the SIKU prototype to teach a culturally relevant curriculum for math and science in local area schools, Heath said. “We’re teaching by using data collected by Inuit hunters and examples that are culturally relevant,” Heath said. “We’re even teaching trigonometry by looking at the angle that the eider duck dives underneath the ice, for example.” The NGO’s vision is to bring the right curriculum to the northern schools to inspire those youth to be the next generation of environmental leaders and researchers, and to provide them with training opportunities with experienced hunters, Heath said.

[Update: Official] Google Keyboard is now Gboard with v6.0 update—includes integrated search, dedicated number row, multiple active languages, and more [APK Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/12/17 2:10am PDTDec 17, 2016 82 Plus 1 on G+ 242 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares407 Applications Google News Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion. Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. It's not only a name change, though. There are a few important new features, including a search shortcut and true multi-language support. The update is still rolling out, and Google has not yet posted an official changelog. Here's what we've spotted so far. G button (enabled in settings) offers quick access to search from the keyboard Pop-out toolbar (when G button not enabled) provides access to themes, settings, one-handed mode, and search Optional dedicated number row Up to three active languages with preference for one (previously had to switch) Gesture typing is now called Glide typing. Search for emoji Rearranged emoji panel with group selection at bottom Emoji have bright halo effect around them GIF button is always shown, but disabled in apps without support. We'll update if we spot anything else, but this should be most of it. Keep in mind, the G button is optional because you can still access integrated search from the toolbar pop-out. It's just one extra step. It's up to you if you prefer to just have the button. That's cool and all, but the dedicated number row will make a lot more people happy. You have to turn that on in settings as well. Those on the team who speak multiple languages seem quite excited about the multiple language support too. You can actually type in up to three of them without manually switching keyboard modes. This is similar to the way SwiftKey does it. The update is just starting to roll out, but we've got the new version on APK Mirror (Android 4.2 and higher). Note, it's in a different area of APK Mirror than the old Google Keyboard, but it is just an update. Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion.

Brad "Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. " AbbyZFresh iOS users barely even use Swiftkey. Let alone Gboard. K.P. Smith Good info. Ryan should include that in the very first sentence of this article that your commenting on ...

Marko Šaric It's not a big deal. It got wiped off. Robert Trance What phone if i might ask...? Marko Šaric Nexus 5x. jesuguru Knuckles (for screen)? Fork and knife (for eggs)? Marko Šaric Hand for dipping bread in egg yolk. Dominic81 "multiple active languages" FINALLY!!! WORPspeed THIS!!! SO much this! I was excited for gboard, but lack of this was holding me back, but reading that it is now included, I can say ADIOS SWIFTKEY! Or maybe it doesn't work as good :P Swiftkey isn't bad, just excited about gboard :D motoridersd Same! I love SwiftKey, but it can do some annoying things from time to time. I'm definitely going to be check out this new Gboard. WORPspeed And I already switched back to swiftkey. The delete swipe gesture on gboard is just horrible, it should just delete 1 word per swipe, not every either 1 letter or the whole sentence.....needs an undo button. The layout...well I'm just used to Swiftkey's layout and the way swiftkey is smart enough to isnert a space after a comma....small things that make gboard a horrible experience for me. I do keep it around incase I want to sent a gif/meme image, it's easier switching keyboards then apps :D motoridersd Yeah, the placement of the question and exclamation marks on Gboard is awful. Too many taps to get to them (they're probably hiding behind another key, but I didn't go hunting for them). Not getting a space after a comma, or getting a space after a word when putting in a question mark was annoying. The delete gesture is definitely not good on Gboard. Jordan Long press m or n is too many taps for question marks and exclamation points? Or press and slide on the period key? They're all very easy to get to. Also the slide-to-delete action is great. I don't know of any keyboard that does it in a significantly better way. motoridersd Turns out I had the symbol setting turned off, so I didn't see any of the characters on the letters or the period. The slide to delete on Swiftkey works very well because it works on the whole keyboard, not just on the backspace key. I've been spoiled by just swiping anywhere to delete a typo. You have to disable flow typing for this to work, but I don't miss that feature. Zorkos You don´t need an undo button. After you delete something the deleted text will appear as a suggestion Urs Müller It also doesn't seem to predict the next word. Instead it shows options for the currently swyped word... Also back to Swiftkey for now. Rapper_skull My dream came true. Rod Our* Rod What? Like in Swiftkey? rauldzmartin Exactly. Mario Porfírio Souza I hope that feature works well, because in swiftkey dont work well HARAMBE It doesn't even correct italian words with some french shit! GLORIOUS Vincent Bye bye SwiftKey samiazza Can somebody explain how does this work? Georgiy Alexandrov I guess it will predict words for both languages depend on what you type in, without need of switching languages manually. Apps By Usman basically what swype provided years ago :) (it's good to see google adapt it) bat0nas Exactly. Been using multiple language in Swype for years. HaltestelleLuitpolthafen I text in both German and English, but 75% of the time in English. I don't have to go into settings and manually switch it from English to Germany anymore, I can have it do it on the fly and set it to prefer English since that is what I predominantly speak. Felix /Offtopic When I interpret your username right you're from Mannheim? Why do you speak English predominantly? ;) mitchilin You don't have to go into settings. Just press the world icon on the keyboard and it changes language instantly. I've been doing this for years with German. snoop doge what do you exactly mean by it? Ashish Bogawat It is a good start, but Swiftkey has quite a headstart with support for many more languages. It (Swiftkey) even does English & Hindi, even though they use different scripts. I type in English and it suggests matching Hindi words along with the English suggestions. Ash Google has that as well, but that keyboard is Google Indic keyboard prediscover no asian language support though :( Ash Hindi, Tamil etc are Asian language. Fir Chinese there is seperate keyboard prediscover I thought Hindi had a separate keyboard too jenderalcilik I too excited for this. I installed right away after reading that sentences. I mean I always loved Swiftkey, but sometimes I hate it when it loads so slow when I switch from app to app. I hope this worked well. Eddy Nelson Lopez This is so épico ahora puedo change languages sin tener que touch the world icono 😂😂 Total Insecurity Hahaha^^ Robert Trance LOL, you so won this thread.... Avishek Jajajajaja Lord Argyris One upvote, duly earned. El_Big_CHRIS My main reason for sticking to SwiftKey, maybe I'll finally ditch it iiku it is also available for chrome spellchecking. Vratislav Jindra "multiple active languages" I HATE IT SO MUCH!!! I've never used it on other keyboards which had this feature. When I'm tapping, the keyboard usually guesses the language correctly. But when I start the text with swiping, it's more like 50:50 - sometimes it guesses the correct word, but very often it also offers me a word from a different language. I'd rather keep pressing the "switch language" button on my keyboard to switch languages manually instead of relying on a technology which fails half the time. bidou I don't like it either. It always writes the wrong word from the wrong language. You can disable it in the keyboard options and go back to the normal "press the switch language icon" type. Vratislav Jindra You're right, I must have missed that setting. Thank you very much! Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez It's happening!! Aleluya! I've been waiting eagerly for this feature since Google Keyboard supports Gif images. Sorry Swiftkey but now is time to move on. HopTzop Too bad it doesn't work well, at least here it's a pain in the arse. Also sometimes doesn't get the whole sliding and gives just a letter, sometimes it gives a totally different word that has nothing to do with what you slide, but happens to start with that letter. They just made me buy Swype which feels like it's reading my mind and runs buttery smooth. Bewear ARM64 only :c aSquard http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-release/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-armeabi-v7a-android-apk-download/ Bewear Thanks. Brian ARM64 though :( Phoenix FUUUUDGE Andy Roid Whaaaa Adrianus AJ Nadeak There's an ARM version available. Michael Carr Can't say I'm a fan of the name change, but the new features sound cool. Downloading! Phoenix OMG is this really happening ? is this really happening ? FINALLY Carson Saldanha Ohh yeah... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif Phoenix I spoke too soon, it's still not happening for ARM owners lol just ARM64 Carson Saldanha Hopefully APKMirror will have the arm version soon. Artem Russakovskii Up now. Volodesi A number row? Finally. I can stop using SwiftKey. k0n And symbols hinting! I can have it set up almost exactly like SwiftKey now, but with added benefits and no extra app required :) FrozenHotChocolate Trying this right away!. But will still need a lot of improvements on the predictions front to pull me away from Swiftkey though. Michael Schaap Neat. Looks like it finally has most of the features I'm using Swiftkey for. (Number 1: multiple languages simultaneously – I tend to type in meerdere talen tegelijk; number 2: number row.) I guess I'll have to try it out and see if it beats Swiftkey yet. (Its prediction is still scarily accurate, though.) Rod It's been said here that it now supports multiple languages simultaneously. Michael Schaap Indeed. That's what I'm saying. Rod It's like a dream came true, until I saw the arm64 requisite.. Comediante "Optional dedicated number row" - It was about time! Only thing I miss is the hability to theme choosing colors (primary/accent) from a material color pallete and not just choose from a limited theme gallery. Jaime Andres Salame Borja Does it have Gif search? AdamH Yup, only works in Hangouts tho.. Artem Russakovskii Not only. In Messenger too. Badouken And Allo :P Abhilash Bingi Yup, but the app has to support it. Only Messenger and Hangouts do as of now. Rod No love for 32 bit. :( Baalinooo Not available for Nexus 6 then? :( Ten Bears not yet anyway... Rod Nope. CD RW ARM apk now available ntomka You don't have to wait for long. I got it through Google play update to my Honor 6 Plus, which is a 32bit phone. 😃 Rapper_skull Then upload the APK to APKMirror. EDIT: Never mind, it has already been uploaded. Rod Excellent news. Thanks! Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9835dd11c8683e36c4fcf70d1cd5c1ccbb48c6158a3019cd0c72fdcb6fce9949.gif Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif mx3 But no emoji prediction :( Caleb Lee ☹️ someone755 This guy does not use Gboard. cowboysfanzz Use Textra with Gboard it's heaven mx3 This has nothing to do with emoji prediction. cowboysfanzz Yes. Textra has emoji prediction XerBlade But it's a single SMS app, not something that magically adds stuff to the keyboard, so it doesn't help you in literally every other app on your device. wade_county I must be blind, where in the settings is emoji prediction in Textra? Corey Kinard If only Textra would use, or allow as an option, stock Android's quick reply in the notifications (where it sticks) and also added the stock inline reply option in heads up messages. It feels so cluncky to have their huge "quick reply" screen pop up now. I guess they could slim the app a bit by dropping the GIFs too since it's in Gboard. Marcus Clendenin You can search in the emoji keyboard. It's not as nice as the emoji prediction in Swiftkey but it does help when trying to find an emoji Cakefish Emoji search doesn't work for me. Just says "data for emoji search is not available". Weird. Checked permissions. Checked internet connectivity. Marcus Clendenin I saw a reddit comment that said the initial download needs to happen on WiFi? So maybe try doing that. I haven't been on WiFi today so I can't confirm whether that works Cakefish You sir, are a gentlemen and a scholar! Thanks! Jacques Ligier Can anyone confirm whether it works? Robert Trance I can predict for you... Marko Šaric Poll: What was your first search ever with gboard for android? AfrodanJ Pictures of Santa PHLAK What about gif support? Kyle Gospodnetich It's been there for months. Aaron I see it but it's crossed out here. Guess it only works on apps that support it. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, the button is now permanent, just disabled in app that don't support it, which is different than the previously confusing contextual GIF button. JSo You can now do a search with the keyboard which will pull up gifs in the results like it does by hitting the "gif" button. I tried it in Inbox but it inserts the link and not the gif itself. Anthony Castanza Its actually happening!! But what are we going to complain about now?! Oh wait, Allo. Nevermind. Michael Kennedy Fuckin' Allo... :( rauldzmartin Is it not killed by Google yet? Cesar Something something no sms fallback... Rapper_skull Multi-language is not exactly what I wanted. I now see IT - EN - ES, meaning that I will receive suggestions for Italian, English and Spanish. But what I really wanted was scrolling the spacebar to switch language, so that I can type Greek letters while writing. Unfortunately writing math will still be slow. Martin Can't you just tap the "change language" key? One tap, and there you have your Greek keyboard. Rapper_skull Nope, I also have other keyboards, so a lot of taps are needed. Martin I'm not talking about the "Change keyboard" button. I'm talking about the "change language" key next to the space key. You can enable it in the settings ("Show language switch key"), and it lets you cycle through your language with single taps. Rapper_skull Like the default Android button, it still cycles between keyboards. Martin That's strange. I have four different keyboards installed, and the language switch button only cycles through the different languages in Gboard for me. YouNex Long press number row for (some) Greek letters ! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad08d55f06a775a882ce447cac20fc395dae92cb2d45714f508054225311896c.jpg Rapper_skull Doesn't work for me :( YouNex Android version/GBoard version ? Tomáš Petrík Can you disable all of the top rows? No suggestions, no numbers, no G button, no themes shortcut... Just make it gone. I can do that in current version. If that option is gone, I will hesitate to update. I value screen estate. mattcoz Yes Tomáš Petrík Thanks! Igor Stanić How? mattcoz Oh, I see now that it still shows a bar with everything turned off in some apps. I tried it from the search bar and it wasn't there. Sorry about that. Tomáš Petrík Sadly, the answer is no. mattcoz Right, as I mentioned in my followup reply. Jaime Andres Salame Borja I wanted to search GIFs in Whatsapp? then i believe Whatsapp has to add the search engine... :( AbbyZFresh No gif support. Back to Swiftkey. Naxx ENVY It does support gifs... press the emoji button and its at the bottom,. the app has to support them too though senor_heisenberg Awesome. I'm so glad this was an update and not a separate app. Maxr1998 "Introducing Google Type, a smart keyboard with Google Assistant, tied to your phone number, and without SMS support." Vincent Don't give them ideas.. Clawz114 "The emoji panel was causing confusion with our users, so we have seperated this from the Gboard and Google Type to it's own dedicated emoji app, Gemoji." T4rd Hope they fix the the space bar cursor moving gesture, as it rarely works for my on my 6P. Sometimes if I try it for 20-30 secs it'll eventually remember I had that feature checked and start moving the cursor, so it's basically useless. Cory S Yeah, its a little stiff. I like the way it works on Chroma. Dehaha1 I agree, it's largely useless on my Nexus 5. It usually works on my second or third attempt, however at that point it would have been faster to just tap where I needed to go. On my iPad Mini 2 using GBoard it works much better, though sadly not as flexible as what is built into the default Apple keyboard. (Though I can't give up using GBoard, the gesture typing is too useful) mattcoz Are you holding and sliding or just doing a quick swipe? T4rd Tried it both ways several times. But I see now that if I do a quick swipe, it seems to work better, but still kinda inconsistent and awkward to use. Like your finger has to already be swiping before you touch the space bar, which doesn't feel right. So I think they need to tweak this gesture to allow you to do it while holding in on the space bar for a split second before swiping at least, esp since that doesn't have any other function associated with it (at least in my config). mattcoz No, you should NOT be doing a quick swipe. You hold it down and slide your finger, don't lift it until the cursor is where you want it. If that's not working, then there's something wrong. Martin I don't know if I'm just lucky, but I got it to work on the new Gboard on every single try so far. Previously it would always bring up the "Change Keyboard" menu instead, no matter how fast or slow I tried swiping. Simon I agree this function works much better with this new update. Berkay Did they add the two new keyboard themes that were on the pixel? Badouken Yes it has the blue color schemes for standard light and dark themes. Berkay I went ahead and got the APK because I was impatient, thank you anyway :) How do I use the GIF functionality? It doesn't seem to work anywhere. JSo Only works in apps that support it. Google Messenger, Hangouts and Allo. App developers apparently have to enable it themselves Badouken Mine didn't work at first but then randomly appeared after awhile. It appears when I clicked the smile icon at the bottom, it would then show a gif button next to it. Berkay Whenever I use the emoji search, it's so laggy... But google keyboard has been laggy for me since they introduced the update where they added all those new features like one handed mode. Tiuri Elvander I saw saw a video showing that the iOS version could send little screenshots of search results. I can't find a way to do that in this version of am I missing something?? Lazyboy0172 unfortunately doesn't look like we're missing anything. whenever I search for something it shows a "share" button but just inserts the text from the result as well as http link for the search. It's not the worst, but I'd much prefer to insert it as an image, especially in apps that support the official api for image insertion from keyboard. I mean it's already there with gif search, so why not make those shared search results as pretty in my text message as they are on the keyboard? Still very happy to be able to search from keyboard though, and be able to search emoji. Goodbye, Dango. Goodbye, Swiftkey. Please keep improving, GBoard. Paul_Werner I wasn't using Swiftkey but I was just like you regarding Dango. Glad to have it a part of the built in keyboard now saf1927 The multi language support works really well with two languages. Haven't added a third yet, but now Swift Key is really obsolete for me. Christopher Robert Does it allow for keyboard size scaling? How about better prediction? Themes? yep still not a good replacement for Swiftkeye. Tuck Choate Yes, yes, and yes. They're in the settings. Good thing Swiftkeye has good autocorrect. It'd be embarrassing to make a typo that contradicts your point online. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Multiple active languages". That look a long ass time to happen. br_hermon I want to like Gboard but it's lack of secondary key functions keeps me using SwiftKey. Abhilash Bingi What do you mean by "secondary key functions"? If you mean typing symbols by long pressing alphabets, you can do it in Google Keyboard. br_hermon Thanks the heads up! I never knew that. It's disabled by default. I had to go into settings to enable it. epsiblivion not a fan of all this rebranding to G products. must be new internal management on the apps. Ben G products... like what? Except this one? Perry Mason Gmail /s Todd I really hate that they did it to their email app. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. bikrame Hey guys, how do i add that numerical line above on keyboard. JSo Settings>Preferences>Toggle Number Row bikrame There is nothing like that JSo Then maybe it didn't update for you. bikrame I just downloaded. Vorastra https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a256e9e1393428c03b73ef88560b8959247cf4df2fb8b4664a215b5763527b9a.png bikrame https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cb2c9e011ee1cbea13883ec8e56c4afa707debc7c253dac399b7fa0841d64ae7.png Vorastra Super weird. You're missing the whole "Keys" section. bikrame May be its because i don't have stock Android ??!! Georgiy Alexandrov You downloaded it from Play Store? Then I suggest you check version number, it should be 6.0.65 bikrame ok now its going to sound super weird. I did download from play store and it says like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/599303b5bf88aff23f000101544e9f9f626e9d31d3a791cf557f08a8bef2ddb1.png Georgiy Alexandrov It's not really that weird, update probably not rolled out to you yet. You will get it a little bit later (or just download apk from link in article). And you should actually check app version through settings>apps>gboard (if you not seeing Gboard in apps try to look for Google Keyboard) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eff26cc1692310ac42f8878e975697259b70c46702b63ed7fd373a8d67597b.png Kieron Quinn It's on staged rollout and hasn't reached you yet, use the APK Vorastra I'm not using stock android. Using an LG G4. Georgiy Alexandrov Settings > preferences > number row Alex Guitar This is mucho bueno for my Spanglish! Frisi *muy :P Frisi Bye Swiftkey. It's me or Swiftkey caused more "typos" than any other keyboard? Of course, Swiftkey would correct them, but I type better using Google's Keyboard. Now with multi-lingo support I'm more than happy. motoridersd I've been using SwiftKey for a long, long time since I have always needed two languages. I have not been using Flow since I live by the swipe to delete gesture. I love the SwiftKey prediction of emoji, I use it ALL the time, and I am very used to the layout of the keyboard. Trying Gboard for the first time, it feels odd, but it's easy to type in. It doesn't seem to always introduce the period after hitting space bar twice. Swiping the backspace key to delete a word is cumbersome because the surface is very small, so I'm missing that already. There is no emoji prediction, but the search is nice. Unfortunately it doesn't know the latest emoji like bacon, avocado or facepalm, but once they are in the recent window, this can be less of an issue. The prediction does not work in the search box, which is a shame, because searching Google without it is a PITA. Hurricane Andrew The prediction also does not work in Chrome or the Facebook search field. Big oversight. motoridersd Yeah, I use that a lot with SwiftKey. A new Gboard update just came through, wonder if they're tweaking these things. Christian yup and for this thing i still use swiftkey, is really helpfull the prediction in chrome ;) Freek Smulders This is pretty big! #NotMyPresident Why would you want an advertising company logging all your keystrokes? PVL_93_RU I'd rather trust them than my own government to do the same #NotMyPresident LOL. Okay..... /rolleyes 7-down It's in the settings. You can disable sharing of what you type. #NotMyPresident And if you believe that Google respects that, I've got a bridge to sell you. 7-down Hopefully it's the Golden Gate Bridge. I really like the way it looks. http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ec/ec23811e3ebf097d66addd31391d2b84d094eb85cc37a9b74dec3475a722ca0c.jpg XerBlade Gboard settings > Advanced > Disable "Share snippets" (if it really bothers you that much) P.S. It never actually logs all your keystrokes, even with that enabled. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I see how that could be a concern. They should've filtered the keyboard the way it is in iOS, since that would probably give a lot of people more peace of mind. For example, on iOS, you can't enter your password using Gboard for this exact reason. Whenever you have to enter a password or pin number, it automatically reverts back to the default keyboard (which doesn't store information) to prevent anything getting leaked. But, all in all, this version is pretty cool too. XerBlade ...Seriously, this isn't sending your passwords back to Google. Apple did things that way in iOS to prevent possible malicious third party keyboard replacements from taking advantage of that (which IS a concern in Android: seriously, you probably shouldn't go around installing random keyboards from people you've never heard of). This keyboard, being not-a-malicious-app and all, simply never includes anything marked as a password field in the "snippets" it sometimes [optionally] collects as statistical data for use in improving the app. Knowledgeborn Allah At least that's what they tell you... I'm not trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but we don't really know what's happening behind the scenes. Google is an advertising company, and their job is to know as much about you as possible. Statistical data is one thing, but personal information is something different. Another thing that separates the Android version from the iOS version is that the Android version is tied to your Google account, while the one on iOS functions independently. That's how, on Android, they can share "learned words" across your Android devices. They can filter these through your devices because, since they're tied into your Google account, what you type (or at least some of it) goes through Google's servers. It's not anonymous data to just improve the app. It's data specifically about you, tied to your personal account. PVL_93_RU So when the G button is active - how do you switch languages? Do you just tap the same key? Is there a gesture like swipe the spacebar (swiftkey)? Frisi You don't have to now since it will automatically "change" as you type. PVL_93_RU I don't like that XerBlade The G button is unrelated. By default, it has multiple languages active simultaneously (so you just type and it intelligently figures out which language you're using as it goes). Or you can manually switch languages by long pressing spacebar (was already a thing in Google Keyboard). OR you can enable the dedicated language switch button in the settings (was also already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar (note the optional G button is on the left side of the suggestions pane, so again, completely unrelated). PVL_93_RU >OR you can enable the language switch button in the settings (was already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar Phew, thank god Kwetsima Maluleke Number row? Finally! Nuno G. Gboard?! What were these guys drinking?!? raazman The good stuff. tim242 Nothing good about this POS. raazman You're entitled to your own opinion. To me, the best keyboard out there just got better. tim242 Yeah, because a blank bar taking up screen real estate is so much better. I'm glad you like it. raazman What blank bar? tim242 The settings bar, above the keyboard. raazman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2569deb1397c93e3c918c8e97290dbd8c70fafb66fa9d5277b20236aa34124a6.png Huh? What exactly are you talking about? tim242 That bar where you have suggestions. I don't use suggestions. If you disable suggestions, the bar remains as a blank bar. They do this on about every other version. raazman Ah ok, makes sense. I use the suggestions so I never had the need to remove it. Aaron Sounds like a personal problem. tim242 You sound like a blocked problem : ) Aaron Doesn't matter. You can't stop anyone from replying. Wis Ciao Swiftkey, this is soooo good - everything I wanted. Thx, Google... David Prieto What's with the emoji search? Why doesn't it return any results? JSo Emoji search is working for me. ADofCLE The number row is probably the only new feature I am going to use lol mattcoz Dedicated number row? Dedicated number row?! DEDICATED NUMBER ROW!!! Andy Roid Yes, that's what it says in the article mattcoz It sure does! Adrianus AJ Nadeak #DEDICATEDNUMBERROW yka1988 OMG finally! I just switched back to SwiftKey after months and months of using the super snappy Google Keyboard. Those were exactly the things I was missing, and especially the language features made me switch back recently. well, byebye Swiftkey, welcome back Gboard :) El Jefe this is great so now I can do GIF kb in Hangouts but only lif not via SMS. In the Google Messenger app, I can do GIF kb with SMS... I'm running latest everything 7.1.1 ahhh Jordan L I'm not seeing the G button on my Pixel XL. anyone else? I enabled it in settings. rebooting now. I also don't see any text predictions. the whole top bar is missing. EDIT: reboot fixed. XerBlade Make sure you're in an app that supports text predictions. It won't show up if you are typing in the Google search bar, for example. Bewear Emoji search not working for me. It might be because my device is set in Spanish. Scros97 A mi sí que me funciona en castellano la búsqueda de emoji!

Shame I won't be until tomorrow. keithzg See this is when it pays to have two devices, so you set one to be a wifi hotspot, then trade off ;) Kieron Quinn My Nexus 5X IS a hotspot, because my flat wifi is broken Ashwin I've installed the app on wifi, have been on wifi the entire day and also tried the same with the new update and still the same error persists for me. What do I do? Cakefish Same but my language is English :( alessiolarva No way to search images directly from the keyboard? tim242 Great. From 41, to 72 MB running service, and laggy again uggggh Aaron Really? Not seeing any lag here. Maybe it's your phone? Would be the first time a Galaxy experienced lag... tim242 Yeah, because a Galaxy chooses which versions of Google Keyboard to lag on. *Eye roll JSo No lag here either. It's not the update. Rod Actually it's showing up as 100mb ish for me. Alex Feels like they finally fixed the Google keyboard lag. That is my only gripe with my Pixel XL ahtough that problem was also on the 6p). Cakefish "Data for emoji search is not available." What does that mean? Samson Don't know. It works for me. Cakefish What phone do you have and which Android version? I have Nougat 7.0. Samson Much appreciated update. I like it a lot! Rod This is the official Google keyboard. Samson It is now. And the problem still exists. So I had to go back to the older version of the official Google keyboard. Very disappointing. Dustin Mingo Swipe from backspace is gone :( Georgiy Alexandrov It still there, or did you mean something else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/09a329c7a63ed9bb2bcdeec4f5376ebdb3d98d40b75e3f7e2788bf488a681485.png Dustin Mingo Setting's gone for me. I'll clear data and report back Georgiy Alexandrov That's good to hear JSo No it's not Rod It isn't. Steve Will they ever enable its auto-corrections/auto-suggestions when searching? Rocket Does anyone know what happened to picture background? JSo You mean in themes? It's still there Rocket On the old Google Keyboard you could select a picture as the theme, but it looks like its gone now. JSo It's still there for me. I don't know why it's not working for you Rocket Did you do it as an update or as a new installation?? JSo I installed the apk right over my existing app Rocket Im gonna reinstall Google Keyboard (and brave the clunky LG Keyboard) and then update to GBoard Rocket Got it working by selecting a theme and then updating. Now it's an option. Georgiy Alexandrov Working for me on 7.1 and 6.0 but not on 4.4. Well, that's weird Rocket I'm on 5.1 so maybe that has something to do with it? Corey Kinard You sure? I press the arrow on the top left of the Keyboard, press the pallet, and the first theme option for me in Gboard is the "My images" one Edit: way too late! Igor Stanić how to disable popup toolbar when g is not enabled???...it just takes up space...everything is fantastic except this freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still better Igor Stanić How to disable suggestion row ...i dont use it so it is blank...terrible Georgiy Alexandrov You can't, as far as i know tim242 Yep, they always fuck something up. I had to revert back. Igor Stanić Me too Archenuh How to you revert back this damn cancer of an app? Dave Okay, wow. This app somehow fucked up my Pixel XL. I've installed it and it always freezed and didn't let me close the keyboard anymore. So I force restarted where it got stuck. I've hold down the power button again to force restart and when it booted up I was set back to Android 7.1 (had 7.1.1) and I can't access recent apps, can get into the quick settings, have different system settings (for example it vibrates when pressing home although I had it disabled) and it doesn't get data connection. What is this? JSo I really don't think a little keyboard app could cause all that. The most that could probably happen is that the keyboard may keep force closing if you installed the wrong version but I don't think it would do all the things you said happened. Dave I don't know either. But that's how it went. Everything was working fine and after I've installed the keyboard and it kept freezing and therefore covering up half my display although I was on the homescreen I force restarted where it got stuck. One again force starting brought me to that situation I am in now. Zach Mauch LOVE LOVE LOVE the dedicated number row. I would also like the option to add a "tab" button to the keyboard. suavemezie No emoji predictions? JSo What are these emoji predictions everyone is bringing up? Georgiy Alexandrov A SwiftKey (or other keyboard) feature, something like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/045c7a98611e38f08413474280cb41eb8fd78121f38eae7386543f5cc4490eb2.png JSo Was this something that was shown by Google or that the GBoard on iOS has? Just seems everyone is bringing this up all of a sudden. Georgiy Alexandrov Idk, but I dont remember Gboard having this on iOS. I guess it just a popular feature that many custom keyboards have. DubeBoom While Gboard feels much faster and more fluid, there are some things I just like about Swiftkey like the easy access to ? and !. But I'll try using Gboard for a few days to see if I get used to it. JSo Turn on "Long Press For Symbols" for easy access to those. Ashish Bogawat I have that option, but with Swiftkey you don't even need to long-press. Just swipe left on the '.' key. Seems small, but is super efficient once you get used to it. mattcoz Another quick method is to swipe from the symbol key, see if that works for you. Adrianus AJ Nadeak It's not as easy on a wide phone like the Nexus 6. mattcoz True Rod Decrease the long press delay, set it to 120ms. It'll make your life easier. Arshdeep Singh Saini It doesn't install 😢 Nathan J Aww. Google Keyboard's growing up. It was always my favorite keyboard on Android, even though it lacked some features of other keyboards. It was accurate which is what I liked. "Gboard" is a downgrade. On iOS, the Gboard autocorrect is just off the wall. Microsoft's Flow Keyboard (did y'all get that yet?) is better for trace typing, but it will not learn new words. No curse words, no proper names... gotta tap that out. So I deal with Gboard since it will learn... but not from its mistakes. It might be a limitation of iOS, but Gboard on iOS is vastly inferior to Google Keyboard on Android. Coming from someone who has used both extensively. Craig Nelson I have both myself and you're right the auto correct on Gboard IOS is not as good as IOS native keyboard but I will say that the Gboard on IOS seems slightly better than the one on android when it comes to the fluidity of finding a search result and using it. Max Not a second-copy-of-the-same-app? S**t what's happened Google? mrjayviper finally catch up to iOS. Thanks google. I'll be enjoying this on my note4 as I've been doing on the Air2 and 6s+ itsatrap Its good but still no better than Swiftkey. Not even close. jl2222 ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You can perform google search in Swiftkey? Find a gif without leaving the keyboard? itsatrap Those things are extras, keyboards are for typing. Swiftkey is still far better at it. On top of that, there is this annoying bug: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 Rod I agree. Swiftkey still has the lead. Azzy Fuck, only 3 languages at a time! Luckily SwiftKey can accommodate 5, just the number I need! Rod You speak 5 languages? Not bad! steb0ne Finally NERV I am still waiting for it to include those Asian languages so I don't need to download a worse separated one. xunknownx finally! been waiting for the google keyboard to have a dedicated number row. Albin Does it record keystrokes? Rod Of course. Machine learning is a thing. Umer Farooq It now also supports Urdu swiping and suggestions. Vincent Goh Asian languages? I need English, German, and Chinese. I don't need multi languages to include Chinese, but I don't want to switch keyboard app whenever I need to type Chinese. pfmiller Might be more realistic for them to add better English and other Latin alphabet language support to the Pinyin keyboard. I can understand them not wanting to clutter up their main keyboard with various input methods. Ramiro Fernandez I noticed something, don't know if it's new to this version but pretty sure it is. The keyboard will sometimes now correct *back* one word if the next word you type changes what it would predict. So I typed "I'm feeling" but when I typed "I'm" it detected it as "on". Then after typing "feeling" it changed the "on" to "I'm". Gave me options for the two word suggestion too (see screenshot). Doesn't always happen, I guess it depends on how close I was with my gliding and how confident it was with the original prediction. I've never seen this before, but it's really clever. I wish it would take context into account better when suggesting words in general. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f788aeb53d108efe429fbde31f0cead3ef3ecba862432200ee25bd8e1eecf969.png Rod Yeah, I noticed it yersterday whilst replying to a Reddit comment. itsatrap Do you guys have this problem: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/sxhRXvLfILk WesleySmalls Have they learned nothing from the IE6 toolbars? benjammin03 I am waiting for the google keyboard to have the swipe left to delete the last word. After using it on Swiftkey, it's impossible to use a keyboard without it. Portgas D. Ace Gboard does have this option. benjammin03 I think I tried this before, but I couldn't get used to having to start at the delete key. I'm used to being able to swipe left from anywhere. I forgot about it though, so I'm going to give it another shot since this is the only reason I still use Swiftkey. Thanks! Portgas D. Ace I used Swiftkey in the past but never gestures. So I had no idea it works differently there. Rod In Gboard, you'll need to swipe from the backspace key. But, it's more effective, as you can delete a 10,000 word text all at once. Portgas D. Ace https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/751b4dcb558130893fe4db757a19aa363e250b3b3f2f347889f55783a469ef98.png Rod Swipe horizontally from the backspace key, and you can even delete the whole text at once. Faheem Ahmed not available in 4.2+ Promethean Add Swypes select all/copy/cut/paste gestures and I'm sold, I use them a lot more than I thought and missed them from other keyboards. Jack Sparrow I find it very buggy. It shows only one result. No horizontal scrolling like on iOS. And the funny thing is, if you search for "gboard", it returns the result for slash keyboard! Is it just me or is everyone facing the issue? Rod What do you mean, horizontal scrolling? Savage Alien "Emoji have bright halo effect around them" Yeah, whose bright idea was this? It doesn't look very pretty. QeeYou i know right 😂, looks very bad in bright themes'. neonix One more new feature I noticed: you can now edit the current theme. I believe previously, you couldn't make changes once the image was set. Dobriy Her Still not available in Turkish play store keithzg Oddly enough, the Play Store is still reporting this to me as Google Keyboard, but showing the version to be 6.mumble, while if I go into Settings -> Languages & Input -> Virtual Keyboards I see Gboard. Portgas D. Ace I get it listed as Gboard the Google keyboard in the updates list and as Google keyboard in the play store listing. dylan-m So, anyone else finding the emoji keyboard uniquely irritating now? They're wasting a ridiculous amount of vertical space, they have *two rows* of tabs, and the bottom row of tabs appears where the space bar is (while the emoji key is right beside the comma key). I frequently end up looking at the plain text smileys keyboard because I happen to miss the comma key while I'm typing. (They probably shifted the keys over by a few pixels again). That would have been fine with the old keyboard because the key to go back was in the exact same place. Now you have to pause and look for it because *the entire layout suddenly changes*. Also, they only have three tiny squashed little rows for the actual emoji, which is as many rows as they have for chrome. It's completely terrible. It would not be hard to flip that first row of tabs to the top, squeeze the search button beside them (because it doesn't need to be a text box and they can probably kill a category or two), and maintain a consistent layout for the bottom row of keys. Anyway, this is the second time in six months they have made significant changes to the keyboard layout, unexpectedly screwing with peoples' muscle memory. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by Google any more, but, it's pretty bad form. Ashwin "Data for emoji search is not available" error when tryed to search emoji...Anyone else with the same error?? Even updated to 6.0.68 (first update after Gboard 6.0.65)...Still no luck...Guys, someone please help!! please Does anyone know how the f I can disable the stupid toolbar? I HATE it, it just takes up space and I'll never use it. Any drastic measure to get rid of it works for me. Archenuh I really need this as well. What the fuck is wrong with them adding that fucking stupid toolbar above the keyboard and not letting us DISABLE it?! please how to disable toolbar LOL How does active languages work? I don't get it Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms... LOL So it only works with Latin alphabet? Rod No, those were examples. The app description on Play Store says it covers over 120 languages. LOL But I cant just write a sentence in English and then throw a word from a different language. To write anything in different language I MUST switch keyboard to that language in order to use that alphabet Rod I have English and Brazilian portuguese set, and I can start a sentence in portuguese, throw in some english words and finish in portuguese, and it will auto-correct all the words automatically. I don't need to tinker with anything at all. Just like in Swiftkey. LOL That's because Brazilian uses Latin alphabet. Its impossible to type a word in a different language if it's not Latin Rod Oh, I never tried another language that doesn't use latim alphabet. My bad. Scorpiax7 How does the "multiple active languages" thing works? i need an explanation, please -.- <3 Dmytro Gulivatyy If you have multiple similar languages installed you can type in both without switching and it will understand which one you meant. It should display the languages that are used on the spacebar key below. Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms. Dmytro Gulivatyy Does anyone know why we're getting it so late? I remember people protecting Google not releasing it on Android because we had G Now on tap but I'm confused now. Mako g now on tap is somewhat hidden in Pixels, so this is a good alternative Dmytro Gulivatyy I know and I agree, but why hold out for months before finally releasing it here kinda saying "Hey, you guys can have it too, don't worry we haven't forgotten." Just feels like it. Mako yeah, I really don't know why it took so long Dmytro Gulivatyy Less resources? Harder to code for? I mean it's their OS. Maybe they didn't care enough because it's easier to search for something with the search bar always accessible, GNow on tap here, and they weren't in such a hurry. But now they come out saying this is a better way. Sometimes i cant understand their behavior. pfmiller Android already has plenty of easy ways to access Google search, so it probably wasn't a big priority. Mwikarago Christian Why doesn't auto suggestion work in chrome search bar? Any idea? Dmytro Gulivatyy It's always been like that. I don't know for sure if i'm right but i think it's because they don't want to mess up your query because it's a browser address field. Same goes for the Google search bar. They think you will want full control over what you're typing because it can get technical, unlike the usual chats you have with people in chat apps. It sometimes offers predictions itself but not always. One of the reasons i'm still with SwiftKey. Mwikarago Christian That's a weird decision on their part. The only time I need autocorrection is in the address /search bar as I usually search using recurring words. That's also the reason I'll stick with SwiftKey Dmytro Gulivatyy Yes, it's been discussed times and times again and even listed as a bug https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 but i personally don't think it's one, they would've fixed it a long time ago. For what its worth i don't understand their reasoning either, you can still type and have it write what you meant and not autocorrect it but i also have other reasons to stick with SwiftKey(one being its better at autocorrecting something when GBoard thinks it was just gibberish and has no clue) but it's getting better and has its charm too. marclee Yes it has been always like this.. I kind of understand why Google wants autocorrect disabled in chrome address bar (not agree tho), I just can't understand it is disabled in Google search bar and YouTube..... Rod That's disabled in the app. Someone on Reddit revealed the code. Pedro Diego Fernández It seems I'm the only one having problems with the keyboard...sometimes I glide I can see it's writing the word I want but when I finish it just adds a letter... and the multiple active languages is too funky to use... had to switch back to aosp :( Navin Govindani Not a big fan of the initial release as it has many problems with Spanish, doesn't suggest anything with "ñ", hell it even tries to autocorrect anything I type with it, not to mention, the occasional lag, I understand it's an initial release but please get your shit together team! MikeOxlong The versions available on apkmirror are old (6.0.65). I currently have 6.0.69 on my 6p and pixel XL direct from the play store... Rod Contact Artem, maybe you can share your apk with them? SyCoREAPER Why does the Google Keyboard fdiffer from the AOSP one? Rod AOSP version is outdated and missing the newer features. It's a bare-bones version. SyCoREAPER Aosp in my opinion is functionally superior with the long press symbols for every key Rod That's also present in Gboard. SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it. pfmiller That's an option in Gboard SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it s427 I think I'll make the switch from Swype to Gboard for good now. The only thing still missing IMO are the gesture shortcuts (copy, cut, paste, select all, change capitalization), which are super useful in Swype. So, GOOGLE IF YOU'RE LISTENING YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO! dk mke That and the exclamation and question mark short cuts as well. By far the best features of any keyboard IMO. It's why I keep going back. Rod As a long-time Swiftkey user, I deeply miss the punctuation auto-spacing. drcaveman Anyone else having the GBoard just randomly stop accepting input? I fix it by hiding and clicking the text input box again. Seems to happen more frequently in messaging apps. freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still way better than this new Google keyboard. First of all, SwiftKey is better with word predictions. Secondly, SwiftKey has emoji predictions and Google keyboard does not. And lastly, the SwiftKey emoji list of emojis scrolls down📜 very smooth and fast. But instead in the Google Keyboard that same emoji list scrolls through multiple horizontal pages instead. It's very slow and takes forever if you are texting. Mace Moneta Still no control, alt or tab key (even just the option in advanced setting would be nice), which is annoying for those of us that ssh into systems. marrecar Ok I updated the app this morning and it completely broke it. No words show up on prediction bar, double space doesn't add a dot, can't delete by swiping to the left, can't move the cursor by swiping the spacebar. Plus the emoji menu looks awful. Does anyone have the same problem? I tried deleting data first, didn't work, then I replaced it with stock version, updated and still the same. obk88 very intrigued by gboard used it for 5 days went back to swiftkey...typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying, gliding isnt as smooth and better emoji experience on swiftkey...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure Christian Wagner Jr Still too large of a keyboard. I have a Nexus 6P and with it on its smallest setting, the keyboard and the box above it take up just under half my screen! SE.Quence so what? just resize it in settings Christian Wagner Jr I did. Its set to the smallest setting. Went thru all the settings as well. If they only gave the option to make it smaller by one or 2 more sizes, I would dump swiftkey for this no problem. Not all of us have donut fingers and need keys THAT large SE.Quence Yep, I can agree that some of other keyboards can be smaller when set to smallest size. But setting GKB to lowest height is pretty decent IMO. Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Can u help me with this? Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature sachouba It only took Google 3 years to add some features available on Samsung's keyboard and SwiftKey. And Google fans sound astonished... patrick yes i had the numbers row on my S4 stock samsung keyboard. but as far as autocorrection, i always found Google keyboard to be more accurate. SE.Quence Testing new GBoard on my 2 Nexus devices. Both running 7.1.1. Dictionary sync doesnt work even when account is set and sync was forced manually. By some reason, GBoard is not presented in Google sync settings (Accounts - Google) but IDK whether it should be here. Who else is facing this? Đức Thành I've been using the APK since a few days ago and autocorrection is still as horrible as ever, especially for Vietnamese. There's no options to set the aggressiveness level of autocorrection, and it's a pain in the neck to hit backspace multiple times for every sentence I type just to go back and fix the incorrectly autocorrected words. Not to mention Gboard now tries to autocorrects whole compound words and phrases, and every time I want to say: "Yo Google keyboard, I appreciate the effort but honestly you are not doing that well since you don't know the language or how I type that well, and your ultra aggressiveness in helping me is creating more trouble than it solves, so could you stop?" In the end just now I had to turn off autocorrection altogether, and now I have to face the problem of not having autocorrection for either language. I wish there were some middle grounds, but Google is too stubbornly extreme in its ways sometimes. Sigh. dhamp2g Vietnamese? ?? Honestly dude, English only ..... LMAO it corrects English well 😂😂 Đức Thành I'm afraid I don't fully comprehend what you mean. Yes it autocorrects English very well, but it has also started supporting autocorrection for Vietnamese since Google Keyboard 5.0, and that's my native language so there's nothing wrong with using that, and since the app itself officially supports the language... Arrgh forget it, you won't get it anyway. dhamp2g I understand , I was just saying all us english speaking folk only car about english problems LMAO :) mizrulez I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't turn off the keypress pop-up in the latest update. I tried deleting data, but the option is still not there. I find the popups extremely annoying. 😏 ggggg Something extraordinary happened. Google updated Google Keyboard instead of creating another keyboard App. mwolverine i wish it would show suggestions when searching in google apps. I usually end up going back to swype because of this. Usman Nagi Only reason I am not upgrading is that I miss the no key delay feature. Is there any way to enable in this current build? It slows my typing down and I only type better with popups. Itchy_Robot Why don't they just put Google Assistant into this keyboard? Renan At least that hideous G button is optional tigerberry Oh hey, finally there's gesture typing for Hungarian! It only took... well, how many years? Too many, considering that other keyboards, even OEM keyboards have been able to do it since ages. And lemme check... yep, still no gesture typing for Japanese in QUERTY mode. Come on Google, even Huawei's keyboard can do it! (I miss the Xperia keyboard. :( I wish it was available for non-Sony phones...) Gwaur I wish there was a way to completely hide the extra row where that G icon is. I found a setting for hiding the icon but the row stayed. It's a goddamn waste of space for someone who's not gonna use it. Fahad Ahmed Why there's no Chinese language included??? That's disappointing. Természetjáró Gayboard. Sorry, I'll show myself out... Patel Nisha I would be happy with a backspace key! Or better still, when using a stylus, thus knowing I went to each letter precisely when swaping, the damn thing would input my entry versus some substitute word! Marco Reali I love GBOARD but two things are very very frustrating: 1. There is no suggestion bar when typing in Chrome. 2. The language switch takes to long to recognise which language I'm typing. I wish they woul reinstate the button for those who want that. I switch language pretty often and I find it horrible to have to re-type words over and over before it's in the right language. WestIndiesKING anyone else getting a little bit of lag when you first start it up after a while of not pulling up the keyboard? I am getting 1-3 seconds of lag before it starts only if i havent used it in a while, after that it flies. Pixel XL 128gb Daddyo Gordon Am I the only one who feels the google keyboard has gotten bloated and too big? There should be an option to keep it at one language, as pioneered by monolingual on the mac (gets rid of a couple Gb of unused languages that waste storage).

A generic test can't (and shouldn't) determine who you are. By Victoria Sowell Have you ever taken a personality test? In a random Google search, I found over thirty, free online personality tests. Overwhelming, to say the least. Why did I type the words “best personality test” into Google search in the first place? I think it is because the person I see in the mirror can sometimes still feel like a mystery, and I want to know her better than I do. This clarity and understanding is what personality tests promise, and it is something we are all after. Giphy   There is no question that this generation is interested, perhaps even obsessed, with knowing where they best fit. It does not take more than a minute of mindless scrolling on Facebook for a personality test to be presented. Some are helpful, while other tests are just clickbait, sucking each victim into their baseless assumptions. Titles like “What Your Favorite Food Says About Your Personality,” and “This 4-Question Quiz Will Tell You If You Are Happy” are everywhere you look. What’s worse: They can be taken seriously. It’s clear, more than ever, that getting ahold of who we really are is the desire of many — especially during a time when it seems not much else can be controlled.   Of course, there is nothing wrong with this. Knowing oneself is a powerful thing. Personality tests are incredibly helpful tools for discovering why we do what we do, how we interact with others, and the lives we prefer living.   I remember, years ago, the first time I took an official Myers-Briggs Personality Test. My results were just a few letters (INFJ for the curious), or so I thought. As I began reading the explanation of my results, I for Introverted, N for Intuitive, F for Feeling, and J for Judging … I felt understood. Through this test, I was given the language for not only understanding myself in a deeper way, but helping others to do the same. I began exploring what careers and personality types I would be most compatible with. I discovered the common fears people with the same results experience. I uncovered a whole new, and foreign world of personality placement. The more I searched, and the more I learned, the feeling of understanding slowly morphed into feeling a bit confined.   What at first was just a tool, though, eventually turned into a label. wifflegif   This label started to feel more like a box, and I began to quietly doubt some decisions, friendships, and directions I had chosen. Here is the problem with that: Those things were good for me. Yet, because they did not “fit” into my personality description, I began to doubt more than ever, if I knew myself as much as I hoped I did. After taking a breath and a few steps away from this results-based approach, I learned something.   I am more than just a type.    I am not just my perspective. Human beings are complex, and an online test does not sum us up. We are not just our personality test results. In fact, because we are human, we are constantly changing and growing. Our test results change and the way we approach life does, too. Why do we insist on treating ourselves and one another like we are static — fixed, changeless, without movement? The lessons we learn do not have to become walls, boxing us in. Instead, let’s treat those moments of understanding like doors to walk through. If learning about ourselves through personality tests can teach us anything, it is that there is still so much yet to be discovered. Drake Baer from Business Insider said, “I prefer to not just look at the traits we have but the deeds we do, the projects we pursue, as more of a fruitful inroad into human personality.”   Personality test results are just a few bricks in the building of the lives we want. Ultimately, who we are is seen in how we treat ourselves and the world around us.   Sometimes, life calls for a shift in our normal approach so that we can really succeed. An extroverted person may need to be introverted for a time in order to prepare for a big exam. This does not define them. A naturally-spontaneous person may need to pull in the reins a bit and become more structured to accommodate a new baby. This will only serve them. Taking a personality test is doing yourself a favor. It can help answer hard questions about why you do what you do, and it can add to your overall self-awareness — an underrated and invaluable trait. But let us not become too quick to sum ourselves up in a few letters, or assume that our test results completely define who we are.   What we need and how we’re inclined as human beings is just as important as how we treat others and the ways we extend ourselves and embrace change. Giphy Take hold of the tools offered to you in life, but every now then, feel free to put them back in the shed and get out and live. And don’t fret, how much you know about the show Friends, will not have a direct hand in how well you perform in your next interview. Only you do.   Find Out What The Shape Of Your Face Says About Your Personality Click to view (6 images) Photo: weheartit Christine SchoenwaldEditor Love Read Later   This article was originally published at Darling Magazine.

The deal ensures that innovation and consumer choice [] will continue to be key drivers for the Android ecosystem. Members of the PAX agreement (which means peace in Latin) are Google, Samsung, LG, Foxconn, HMD, HTC, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview. They will be able to exchange patents without charging each other and will hopefully, bring patent peace in the smartphone world. Google points out that Android is already distributed under open-source licenses that allow anyone to use them for free. Such ecosystem, the company adds, includes more than 400 partner manufacturers and 500 carriers that reached 1.6 billion users. Current members collectively own more than 230,000 patents worldwide. This community-driven clearinghouse, as Google puts it, is open for new members.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure.

Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

Today though, a huge update is rolling out with loads of fixes. Starting first with T-Mobile, and owners can expect it to arrive on other carriers soon. Read on for all the details and bug fixes. After the Galaxy S7 release date millions of users started enjoying it, which lead to more and more issues being mentioned in forums and on social media. From laggy performance at times, choppy slow-motion recording on the Snapdragon model, battery life, and general stability like freezing or reboots. Read: How to Fix Bad Galaxy S7 Battery Life Our own Galaxy S7 Edge appears to perform quite excellent, but there are still countless issues being reported. Above are a few details regarding how to improve battery life, and that’s just one of many big fixes that all Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge owners can expect starting today, and in the coming weeks. The biggest complaints we’ve seen have been regarding battery life, devices freezing or becoming unresponsive, as well as a few big issues with slow motion regarding being janky and stuttering, rather than a slow and smooth video. That said, Samsung took it a step further and added tons of changes, improved multiple aspects, and quickly released the latest April security patches right from Google. Meaning the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge on T-Mobile will be performing at its best once this update arrives, and the same can be expected for owners on AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and others in the near future. Read: 10 Common Galaxy S7 Problems and How to Fix Them So what’s new and improved or what has Samsung changed? A lot. The changelog below comes from T-Mobile, and will be similar with slight changes for other carriers once those arrive later this week. Galaxy S7/S7 Edge Software Update Enhanced voice services Samsung Pay updates Various system improvements The stability of Recording video has been improved Overall device performance has been improved Battery life has been optimized The security of your device has been improved Device stability improvements, bug fixes Going over all the details it looks like Samsung’s made changed to improve S-Voice, although most owners probably use Google voice or Google Now. Samsung Pay has been improved and updated. The company and T-Mobile made significant system improvements, and the big one, stability of recording video has been improved. We can also expect overall device performance to be better across the board, battery life has been optimized, which should hopefully deliver better performance and longer lasting battery life. Then as mentioned above Samsung is already pushing out the latest April security patch for Android. Google released April patches today as well, so Samsung is on the ball when it comes to device security. Then last but not least we have the usual “device stability improvements and bug fixes”. This is something we see on every changelog, but it’s an important step during the first major software update after launch. Samsung has fined tuned all the hardware, software, camera, and overall system for an improved experience. Looking at the T-Mobile support pages these updates are both rather large. Coming in at over 200MB for the Galaxy S7, and around 150MB for the Galaxy S7 Edge. Meaning these are rather big with lots of changes and improvements across the board. Owners with a T-Mobile Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge can head into Settings > Device > scroll down to About Phone > and check for updates manually. Otherwise, an over the air update notification should appear soon for all users. T-Mobile is the only carrier to make an announcement, but with the April security patch and all these bugs being squashed, expect similar announcements from all major carriers in the coming days or weeks. If you received the update drop us a comment below with any notable changes, or improvements. 14 Official Galaxy S7 Accessories Worth Buying Galaxy S7 S-View Flip Cover   1 / 14 As expected, the popular S-View case is also available for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, and comes in multiple different colors. For the Galaxy S7 there's Black and Gold, the two colors being offered, then for the Galaxy S7 Edge it comes in Black, Gold & Silver. The S-View has been popular for years, and protects your device while letting you interact with it without ever opening the case. Basically offering full protection even while you answer calls, take pictures and more. When closed, the S-View cover offers instant access to critical features through a unique window interface, thanks to the Samsung ID chip. View the home screen to check the time, weather and other status items. Accept or reject incoming calls with just a swipe, or reject calls with a preset message. Control your music playback directly on the S-View screen. If you miss anything, notifications are shown in the recent activity menu of your S-View cover. It works even better with the new always-on display feature.

Ugh. I’m waiting for the AT&T update, but I’ve noticed the issue too. It’s only on the Snapdragon model. I wonder if they’re throttling the CPU too much. I’m really hoping it gets fixed. Because who wants a beautiful slow motion video to be choppy. 04/04/2016 Vanessochka Reply I updated my phone now I cant swipe to unlock to enter my pin! 04/05/2016 Lisa Reply I updated and now my messages app is crashing every time I send a message to a contact I have with many years worth of message. I do not want to delete or lose any messages. 04/05/2016 billyt Reply where is the update? not received yet! 04/06/2016 Jonah bixby Reply Update makes me have to swipe the screen then draw a pattern to open. Liked my phone before the update. 04/06/2016 Haa Reply The biggest problem is the palm rejection issues. I simply have unwanted taps all the time and even can’t write properly when I’m holding the phone even with two hands and it’s really getting annoying 04/06/2016 Eman Reply My T-mobile Galaxy S7 phone seems to lag just a little now with the update installed. Movement used to be lightning fast. I would do a minimal flick of my finger and scrolling would move quickly down to the bottom of the list. Now when i do the same flick, the scrolling slows down and I have to flick my finger a few times to get to the bottom of a list. The phone feels slightly slower while opening Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest apps too. It takes a little longer to show Instagram video content on Wifi now. Before the update, I couldn’t tell if my phone was on Wifi or T-mobile’s 4G LTE data because the videos would load quickly at about the same rate. Now, I can tell when Wifi is on because the videos take slightly longer to load. My Wifi connection has not changed before or after this phone update. This is my initial findings so far. I’ve just updated a few hours ago, so there might be more differences. 04/06/2016 Minerve Reply Does anyone have a problem with the network? I keep losing signal, change to new simcard already but still losing signal especially when i turn on flight mode then turn it off i will losing the network 04/14/2016 Roman Štědronský Reply I have similar problems – when LTE is enabled, phone repeatedly loses network. It looks like everythinig is ok, but nobody can call me and I can’t call as well. I need restart mobile. 04/07/2016 AAA Reply Right from First day I facing issue of apps getting crashed most annoying is getting “Unfortunately,com.samsung.faceservice has stopped” reported to samsung solution provided is Factory Reset. I have told them it is reproducible when we go Gallery each time, I expected if I tell the root cause they may fix it with some patch in future. I think this is smart stay feature issue I hope Samsung will take up this issue and work for Fixing it Even Overheating during charging did they miss adding cooling liquid for few phones? 04/07/2016 SEAN Reply The update caused horrible connectivity issues with wifi and 4G for me. I haven’t seen any issues among other owners yet. 04/13/2016 Paul Reply Same issues for me mate. It’s been bad.

Your device is overheating. You can only use the phone and contacts application.” And then it shuts down automatically without me completing the set up process.

After years of building plastic phones constantly lambasted for their "cheapness," Samsung made radical changes in an attempt to completely redefine its smartphone brand. Those changes were generally well received, but it always felt like they stopped short: the software was still slow, bloated, and the battery life surprisingly poor. With the Note5 and S6 edge+ we saw significant refinement of that reinvention "moment," but not until the S7 and S7 edge did Samsung really build the concept I think they set out to with those first metal and glass sandwiches. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are Samsung's attempt to show us that they can do more than just iterate on that "Eureka" moment they had in 2015, even if those iterations have generally been quite good. And after the Note7 disaster last year, they really need to make good on that promise. After spending some time with the phones last week, I'm still on the fence as to whether Samsung has truly succeeded - but I think the pieces for success are there. Even if I don't think they're all terribly obvious, and even if the phones don't take any real big risks. The hardware Take what you loved about the Galaxy S7 edge and Note7, then just imagine it all being better. More refined, more coherent, more polished. As to that final point: literally. The Galaxy S8 siblings now feature polished aluminum mid-frames, as opposed to the matte anodized finish of years past. In particular - at least in my opinion - this looks good on the Midnight Black version of the phone, which features a shiny black mid-frame to match. The whole phone visually sort of looks like a deep black stone - it's a very interesting and striking effect Samsung has achieved here. As you'd expect of Samsung, the attention to detail is impeccable. The glass meets the aluminum in a very natural, near-seamless way, and the various body colors all have a distinct character. The front of the phones, however, do not: unlike years past, all colors of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will feature black surrounds on the display side of the phone, to accentuate Samsung's "infinity display" and its minimal bezel. I absolutely agree with this design decision, because it brings the canvas - the screen - out as the sole focal point of the front of the device. You're drawn to the screen, and everything surrounding it just sort of falls away. Samsung has been paying attention to the little stuff, too. Everything from the design of the camera module (it now has more of a stylized "lens" effect) to the smooth USB-C cutout seems carefully considered and manufactured with precision. The phones scream quality, and I am continually impressed by Samsung's ability to iterate in this area. Samsung clearly spends a lot of time and energy on its design and manufacturing processes, and it shows. Perhaps most notably, these phones mark the end of one of the last vestigial elements of the Galaxy brand: capacitive navigation keys and the physical home button. It really makes the S8 and S8+ the cleanest-looking handsets Samsung's ever produced. Above the display sit the standard array of sensors, including a new 8MP front-facing camera with software-simulated autofocus (we'll see how that goes) and the iris scanner array. Out back, Samsung says the 12MP rear camera is basically unchanged physically from last year's, with most optimizations happening on the photo processing side. I'm certainly curious to see how photos compare to last year's phones, then. You still get IP68 waterproofing, and 64GB of storage is now standard (with microSD expansion available). Samsung has retained the headphone jack, but made the switch to USB-C it began with the Note7 last year. Wireless charging is intact, too. As to the deceptively giant displays, at 5.8 and 6.2", respectively, the phones are considerably taller this year. But they're also narrowed, meaning they're easier to get a grip on, and they really aren't especially heavy or unwieldy. Ceding so much of what was previously bezel space to the expanded display seems an obvious choice in retrospect, but to me it definitely necessitated the end of the capacitive keys, otherwise all that extra height tends to feel a bit wasted. Speaking of those keys. The software To answer your first and greatest question: Yes, you can switch the order of the navigation keys. You can either have them in Samsung (read: wrong) order, or change them to the standard Android layout of back, home, and recent apps (left to right). Samsung also lets you customize the color of the navigation bar background, which is nice. Sure, the iconography is nowhere near stock, but I couldn't really give a damn what the buttons look like as long as they do what I expect them to. And no, Bixby is not mapped to long-pressing the home key: that's 100% Google Assistant. (Bixby's functional overlap with Assistant is actually quite minimal - for now.) The latest version of I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-TouchWiz is based on Android 7.0 (not 7.1, sigh) and feels basically similar to what we had on the Note7 and now have on the Galaxy S7 phones. "Grace UX" is the easiest on the eyes TouchWiz has ever been, and while there are still a bunch of old features in there I hardly think warrant the real estate in the settings app, Samsung continues to provide its own useful additions. I didn't spend much time with the software in-depth, as I really didn't have time. And Samsung's Bixby assistant was only demoed to us in a controlled, scripted test environment, which is useless from an evaluation perspective. I can give you the overview, though: it's basically Google Goggles meets Google Now meets voice-powered accessibility controls. It's definitely an interesting mesh of features, though Samsung's hardest push seems to be around the idea that people will want to use their voice to control things like their screen brightness, toggling the hotspot, picking a camera mode or filter, and generally controlling their device. I am, to put it bluntly, unconvinced anyone will use this. But maybe it'll win me over when our review units come in and I actually have a chance to put it to the test. But, if you were worried that Bixby was an attempt to subvert Google Assistant and replace it: please, don't be. Not yet, at least. Google Assistant and Bixby happily coexist on the Galaxy S8, and are frankly rather different products. Oh, and this is kind of interesting, I guess: Samsung has also implemented the fingerprint scanner gesture to bring down the notification bar. It's off by default, I think, but it's there. Like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge after their respective Nougat updates, the S8 and S8+ don't actually display in their native, physical resolutions by default (they're set to full HD mode). I remain very divided on this choice: while I know the vast majority of people who own these phones will never, ever notice and reap considerable battery life returns as a result, why put in these more expensive ultra-high-res panels in the first place? Samsung's answer, of course, relies heavily on VR, because you need that Quad HD display mode to provide a good VR experience. But I don't think anyone, even Samsung, has actually produced compelling evidence that consumers care about VR (apart from the companies making VR products). I guess it comes down to the question of how much more a Quad HD panel of this type would cost to produce than a 1080p version. If it's not a big difference, then I guess I get where Samsung is coming from. One feature I found quite interesting is the new home button wake gesture. Simply press your finger on the home button that is shown in the always-on display mode for a moment, and the screen will wake, indicated by a light burst of haptic feedback. While obviously you won't get far if you have a fingerprint scanner lock set, you might be more likely to use Samsung's iris scan or face unlock features (the latter is new to the S8). Given rumors that Samsung intended to place the fingerprint scanner inside the display itself with the S8 but failed to achieve the necessary yields, I have to wonder if this is the compromise they've settled on: pushing customers away from the ubiquitous fingerprint scanner, for now, until their more impressive technology is ready for primetime. As for me, I probably wouldn't use the home button wake regardless - the fingerprint scanner is simply my preferred mode of authentication. The reader is definitely a bit of a reach on these phones, though, and even with my relatively long fingers I found the S8+ would definitely take some getting used to in terms of default hand positioning. Samsung's iris scanner tech is fast and very accurate, but I'm not always looking at my phone when I unlock it. Performance on the phones is not something I feel comfortable expressing any definitive opinion on at this time. They felt fine - not crazy fast, not particularly slow - but given the notoriety Samsung's phones have achieved for slowing down over time, my experience in a controlled demo environment is simply not going to be helpful in assessing these things. It's probably better for me to end that discussion here and save the extended thoughts for our review. I obviously can't judge battery life yet, but Samsung shared an interesting figure with me: the new batteries in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature much better cycle longevity than the ones in last year's phones. Whereas after a year of typical charge and discharge cycles last year's Galaxy S7 and S7 edge would see around 20% of their effective capacity lost, Samsung says that figure is more like 5% of capacity lost over a year on the S8 and S8+. That's definitely encouraging. Final thoughts The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are big, beautiful phones. The larger displays are absolutely great, and the switch to virtual navigation keys is long overdue. I'm sure they'll have great cameras, and I expect battery life will probably be largely comparable to last year's phones (i.e., good). TouchWiz is, as far as user experience goes, the best it's ever been. That may not be saying much for some of you, but I generally find Samsung's UI modifications at the very least aesthetically palatable nowadays, and some of the added features are genuinely useful. A switch to 64GB of storage as standard is absolutely welcome and, I think, should be the bar to meet for any flagship phone in 2017. Bixby, despite the fears of many (myself included), doesn't really seem meant to displace Google Assistant or search on your phone. The Snapdragon 835 version of the S8 and S8+ we'll get here in the US packs a lot of new and potent technology, too - it's not just faster than the 820 and 821, it's more efficient and more capable. What am I not loving yet? Launching with Android 7.0 feels oh so typical Samsung: they can preach all they want about how they test their software endlessly in order to ensure updates are smooth and low on bugs, but I just can't shake the feeling that Samsung really has no intention of changing its approach to Android platform updates. Performance is going to be a big question, too (and it's one Samsung seems uninterested in discussing). I won't even be able to conclusively come to an answer in our review, simply due to the amount of time we'll have to use the phones before publishing. That'll take weeks and months of additional testing. Finally, there's a lot of uncertainty remaining around the value proposition these phones will offer, and without pricing, that's hard to comment on just yet. There's also a lingering feeling that the S8 and S8+ feel iterative in terms of actual user experience versus being showcases for advancements in industrial design and engineering. Samsung itself seems very eager to present the reduced bezel and larger displays as the raison d'etre for the Galaxy S8. But it's hard to tell if beauty is more than skin deep with these phones. Why is the screen curved? Because it's pretty (fragile, and the edge UI experience sucks). Why is the aluminum frame now polished? Because it's pretty (and will get scratched). Why aren't the batteries any bigger? Because thin phones are pretty (even though everyone wants bigger batteries). These are thoughts that I've had a harder time shaking than I expected. There's no doubt the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are exceptional achievements from the standpoint of design and phone-building knowhow, but I think I can distill my feelings about them down to this: I'm really unsure why I'd want one of these that much more than a Galaxy S7 edge or, if it still existed, a Note7. If there's some major improvement to performance I missed, maybe that could be it, but on most other fronts - aside from the switch to virtual nav keys - I'm left scratching my head a bit. But, maybe that's just a result of not having enough time with them. Hopefully, we'll be reviewing these phones soon enough, as I'm eager to get a deeper sense of the changes Samsung's made and how they translate into a real-world product experience.

As for android 7.1 it really doesn't matter as samsung usually incorporates a lot of the new features long before they are available on newer android versions. Eagerly looking forward to the Note 8 though (4K screen for VR is going to be a much needed upgrade). Taylor Vaughn I freelance online, performing basic jobs which simply requires from you a laptop or computer as well as internet accessibility and it is a life-saver for me personally... After 6 months on this job opportunity and i gained so far total of 36,000 dollars... Basicly i make about eighty bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hour most of the days.And marvelous thing about this job is that you can easily manage time while you work and for how long as you like and you get paid weekly >> http://v15.uk/xbRHM MJ I agree 4K is much needed for VR but I would question 4K or VR on a phone. LOL Toss3 Why? Works much better on phones as they aren't tethered to anything. Personally only use it for watching movies on planes or in bed when the gf is sleeping. MJ That is your only use cases? It's more useless than I thought. I watch movies on my big screen TV on my sweet couch when the GF is sleeping. No heavy BDSM head gear needed. Toss3 Pretty much. Never liked watching movies on a TV as TVs are always really small (unless you buy one of those 40k ones that are 100"<). I had a projector (with a 120" screen), but I sold it when I moved to another country, and because I don't watch TV that often a "big-screen" TV just doesn't feel that useful. I also like being thoroughly engrossed in the movies I watch without any distractions and only the Gear VR has offered me anything like that thus far. It's also the first private movie-theater that you can take with you wherever you go. The low resolution is the only thing that could be improved (and the straps of course). MJ Sure if it works for you but I don't like things strapped to my head and face. It must be a pain to unstrap when need a drink, snack, or take a piss. Toss3 You either lift the device (similar to ski goggles or snorkel) or you use the built-in pass-through mode. And there's really no need to unstrap anything when going for a piss. MJ I didn't mean literally unstrap but none of that sounds convenient or practical at all. LOL It must be me... MJ Samsung has made a product I would almost consider buying by cleaning up the UX, going with on-screen buttons, better aspect ratio, and minimizing the edge gimmick (next just get rid of it) while keeping the headphone jack and wireless charging BUT... The placement of the fingerprint is just horrible. David, you went on how Samsung pays attention to the details but they just randomly place the fingerprint reader? OK... They still make me wary of getting timely OS updates. Android 7.0? Really? I like to see if they follow up on their promise of monthly security updates on their unlocked phones. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU My S7 Edge, unlocked, Romania, received Nougat but still on freaking January security update! How bout dat? MJ That sucks but didn't they just make that promise a couple of weeks ago? Cristian-Teodor TATOIU They made that promise months ago but with the new top dog in tow... They'll make good on S8, no doubt, for the first 6-7 months. Then, they'll have the S9 to keep them busy. And so on, and so on... Really, really, really want/need timely security updates? Pixel or whatever Google brings out is the way to go. Not freaking out cause of some security vulnerabilities going unpatched for months? Samsung is an option then... They'll update, sooner or... Jordan L my friend, who is kind of paranoid about security, loves the Galaxy series of phones(probably because they look great). From a data security prospective; do you think Pixel or Galaxy is "more secure". He's worried less about hacks on old versions of the OS, he's worried about his cloud data. I vote for Pixel because you are only logging in with your Google account, and not also logging into your phone with a "Samsung" account. to use features. yes, Google tracks everything you do, but they are a US based company. Samsung is not, ... just a thought. I would THINK he would HATE the fact that he logs into his phone with Samsung account too. (you do have to use a Samsung account to fully use a Galaxy phone, right?) Justin You don't have to log in to Samsung's account to use the phone, but you lose out on things like Samsung Pay if you don't. EcE You don't need a Samsung account unless you want Samsung Pay, themes ( and their crapstore) or VR. Even then, they are two different accounts and AFAIK you don't need to share any private information to the Samsung account unless you use Samsung Pay. Vivek Rameses A non us company is much safer and private. Muh americans love garbage made in the US. dabug91 The Pixel would be the superior choice, as they will get monthly security updates through October 2019 at least. Max Johnson Battery size is concerning, but maybe that's something to do with precaution with the fire issue. Lawrence Fail!: It is way too tall, fingerprint sensor on the back, small battery, new bixie assistant with dedicated button, same old camera. Win. 64gb storage, looks cool. Biga173rd So what's a win in your book that can compare to this new phone? Zsolt V The same phone with a fruity fruit logo Biga173rd Ehhhh lno lol Lawrence Thanks for asking : the S7 and S7 edge... Better battery/size ratio same camera, same ram. Front fingerprint, and they can be hold by humans. Biga173rd Good point I personally will wait for the Note 8. Toss3 Agreed on the fingerprint sensor, but it does have face-unlock which should be a useful alternative (it is on Win 10 devices). I seriously don't understand why these companies are forcing AI assistans on us? Do people really use them? AI is useful, but not for phones. Camera is already good enough; use pro mode and it's amazing. Really can't expect better in a phone right now unless you start increasing the sensor size. EcE " this looks good on the Midnight Black version of the phone, which features a shiny black mid-frame to match" Glad to see the black phone is black on the sides, that chrome version looks horrible. Marcel Mayer hä? the device will show on 5pm? why you publish the article? PhillipeFelut so, whats the actual resolution of the display itself? DeathWolfGaming They are set to 1080p to save battery life. PhillipeFelut 2960x1440 is the number i was looking for. Jesse Lee Samsung is really receptive to their markets; a completely opposite direction from years past and from that being employed by Google Inc. The results are phones that continue to get better and better and more practical. Looks great! Timbets Linux 4.4 kernel Ishimaru I'm surprised. Even Google is still on 3.x. ProductFRED I'm not jumping to sell my S7 Edge Exynos just yet. Gotmilo waiting for the note 8 JD It's a damn solid phone. I wouldn't jump unless I pooped money and was having a bad case of the runs. Winston I'm upgrading from my flat S7 to the small S8. Why? Battery has deteriorated, and Samsung usually does really lucrative trade in deals with older phones, of which I still have an S4. John New smartphone releases are beginning to be as exciting as new dishwasher releases. That's a good thing as it means we can hold on to our phones for longer, smaller manufacturers can catch up to the big boys, and there will be more price competition rather than feature competition. Samsung seems to realize this which is why they're making a big push to differentiate on software. We would benefit from more alternatives to Google's software. I'm just skeptical that Samsung is capable. BC Um, why no images of the Dialer App's interface? It's something that I always want to know but never can readily find. David Ruddock Because I had an hour with the phones total and that wasn't really on my priority list. Sorry. BC It's cool, I'm just a weirdo that likes to know what all the interfaces I'll be interacting with regularly look within OEM apps. Cakefish Just look up the S7 Nougat update UI. I am pretty sure it'll be very similar to that, the rest of the S8's UI is. BC Not good enough for me, though I'll likely preorder the device...I'll be able to see it firsthand this way. Cakefish Check out the bajillion youtube hands-on videos, I'm sure one of them has what you're looking for :) BC I can only hope, though I have a feeling nobody will even care about the Dialer App. Cakefish Found one for ya! Look at 2:12 in the video: https://youtu.be/sZvp4L52QzQ BC Thank you! I had begun the scanning of videos to catch a hint of that app interface. Phone_Addiction Time to ditch my ip7 plus for the gs8+ brararsh Thinking of same. Adil Tajgeer i'm in the same boat but with the regular S8, it seems to be a great blend of big screen in a small package. but will just keep my iphone around. I NEED ALL THE SHINY THINGS. Biga173rd Wow!! that is one gorgeous phone. The build quality is incredible damn Sammy knocked it out of the park. And that metal frame... Nuno G. "You can either have them in Samsung (read: wrong)" Although it's not the standard order for Android, for me it's the natural order, specially for right handed persons!!! When I hold the phone, I hold normally with my right hand, so my thumb finger is the finger that is most near the screen on the right side of it. so it's normal for me to have the back button cause that's the one that I use more.. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Right handed persons" all have different preferences, I am right handed and I use the back button on the left. Middlefinger Im a lefty and Samsungs is still the better positioning. Google just have it wrong but the fanbois on here would never disagree with their Google god. JD Gotta say it wasn't until the S7e that I started to look at Samsung and that Samsung actually got me excited about Android Hardware again. I used to be a Nexus Diehard and when Google and other OEMs just all made glass rectangles, some with really bad software decisions I just gave up. But the S7e was something interesting. The S8 is a really lovely piece of Industrial engineering, like what the OG iPhone and iPhone 4 did to the industry when everyone was doing more of the same. jonzey231 I love that they continue to include wireless charging. iKon It's not even wireless... False advertising more like. jonzey231 Kay. Sharky I've been on Nexus for 5 years but I'm going to give this a go. The bezel-less screen makes it look like something genuinely new, I really wish the Pixel had looked this. I'm still skeptical about Samsung's UI skin but the move to virtual (& customizable!) buttons alleviates that a bit. Hopefully this will encourage Google to step up their efforts with the next Pixel, but it's going to take a big jump from last year's model to get me back. Jay The skin has not been a concern since s7. The whole look can be altered with one click via the theme store. I use one that makes it either look like native android or a jet black theme, that's so enjoyable on these amoled screens. Daniel Tiberius I'm looking forward to playing around with those themes. Middlefinger *S6. Sharky Admittedly the skin does looks quite nice now, I certainly hope I'm converted now I've shelled out $850 on this thing. Kevin Chaos I'm using the S7 and I really want the S8... but I'm going to force myself to wait and at least see what Apple has to offer with their next iPhone. That or Google needs to fix the Android messaging clusterfuck they've created. I've been using Android phones since the Nexus One but iPhones have come a long way and iMessage is starting to look really good. Toss3 Not sure why anyone with an S7/S7E would feel the urge to upgrade. Why not use something like Telegram, Whatsapp, etc. instead of SMS? Kevin Chaos I have a problem with wanting new toys constantly, haha. I think I've gotten a new phone every 6 months. Almost everyone I know uses SMS here. I am also using Google Voice myself. I just don't have enough friends who use those apps. At least that's my case in the United States. Toss3 I used to be like that, but now that Android has matured and caught up with the iPhone in terms of smoothness, I really don't feel the urge to upgrade as often as I used to. Only thing I want right now is an HDR 4K screen for the Note 8 and I'll be happy. Adil Tajgeer iMessage has kept my pixel and OP3 in a drawer for most of their time with me. but the S8 is so pretty i will probably bite the bullet and face the shame of the green bubble. fijisiv Why is the screen curved? Because it's pretty... Why is the aluminum frame now polished? Because it's pretty... Why aren't the batteries any bigger? Because thin phones are pretty... While most AP readers probably do a LOT of research before buying a phone, I'd wager a huge majority of phone purchases are done by people who walk into the store and say "oh that one looks pretty." Toss3 Thankfully we still have the Note-series that should cater to a different audience (hopefully). Adnoxaei It's beautiful, but I'll be skipping it it :/ The fingerprint scanned is just in a terrible spot for my normal usage. I hope one of those scanner techs that can go through the screen can get implimented in the next couple generations. Winston It was reportedly very close to being in the S8, but they couldn't quite get something good enough for it to be signed off. So, Note 8? Adnoxaei The note line got the iris scanner, so it is possible. I already think the S8 is a bit big (really, just too tall), so maybe it can be in the S9 and I'll get it then. At least my bank account will be happuer this year haha. Rann Xeroxx Once you use a scanner on the back of the phone, it actually turns out to be better as that is where your fingers typically are when holding the device. The only problem I can see is if you have it on a table or something and want to use the scanner. (I never do this as I rarely will leave my phone on a table). Miguel Fernandes How can it be better with that limitation? Jan Ibrahim Because in most circumstances for a lot of people , you unlock as you remove from your pocket. This is a lot easier with it on the back. Furthermore, it also means you can achieve a nice clean look on the front of the phone. But no solution is perfect, because the downside is desk use. But i find on the odd occasion I'm using my phone on my desk then pattern lock is fine. But I'd rather have on the back with that limitation than the other way around. Look how ugly the fingerprint scanners look on the front of some of the HTC and oneplus phones for example. John My problem with the S8 is not that the scanner is on the back, which is fine, but that it's all the way up next to the camera. Below the camera would have made more sense. iKon It's only good on the back, if it's in the middle like Huawei devices. Samsung has the worst position out of everyone. My name is…. Google needs to take lessons on how to make pretty phones. Who's gonna prefer a pixel to this? Crazy fanboys only. saf1927 People who actually want a phone. No flat display, no good. My name is…. Pixel was a joke of a phone, i cant believe that Google gave that thing iphone price, so ridiculous. Im sure S8 will be better in every aspect. asian_slaw if you are solely hating on the phone because of the price, you definitely dont understand or have experienced the pixel to it's full potential My name is…. I had a pixel on my hands. i also was an owner of all Nexus phones (after Nexus 4) I would never buy a pixel. There are better phones out there that are better. saf1927 Yes, after coming out half a year later, it doesn't take that much to get a better phone out. By the way, the iPhone 7 will still outperform the S8. it’s me tim-cock. Dude calm your tits. This phone puts the garbage looking iphone and pixel to shame. Your move crapple. saf1927 Come again when Samsung actually puts out a phone that is better than an iPhone in all aspects. A high-res display is nothing to flash your ass out for. Lars Jeppesen Yeah, much better display, more ram, better waterproofness, more freedom (default app anyone? ), wireless charging, fast charging, iris scanner, much higher screen-to-phone ratio, SD card support, bluetooth 5, wifi direct, VR, better assistant (Google Assistant/Bixby),, OH YEAH_, the iPhone sure is better... /s saf1927 >much better display Doesn't make a difference since the iPhone has one of the best and most accurate displays in the market. > more ram Well, with the bloat you get from it, I think it's a plus that it has the RAM to cope with it. >better waterproofness Not a deal-breaker >more freedom Nothing to do with Samsung, it's general Android feature. > fast charging / wireless charging I'll give you the first, the second is a gimmick and not really "wireless". >iris scanner A gimmick you can live without > SD card support Not needed since you can't install apps on it. > bluetooth 5 Nice, but the phone is coming out in 2017, least they could do. > better assistant Google Assistant, yes. Bixby is yet to prove itself. Now, when Samsung and Qualcomm can match the A10 performance, let's talk. Rann Xeroxx Why on Earth would you pay the absurd price for the Pixel compared to a phone like this? Heck, the Pixel is ugly to boot. And purely from an enterprise standpoint, it has real problems with MDM and ActiveSync configurations to where Samsung goes out of their way to make sure it works perfectly on corporate solutions. saf1927 I actually have an iPhone 7 too, which of course is better than anything Samsung puts out. Looks are subjective. I hate edge displays, so this phone is as ugly as it gets. someone755 Agreed, keep it flat so I can put a normal screen protector on it. JohnyNoLegs Can't even do that on the pixel. These days are over someone755 Then I simply won't buy a phone like that, and I advise anyone that sympathizes with my hate of curved screens to do the same. Vote with your wallet. New_Guy Somebody just dropped some world-class knowledge. Kudos Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "the Pixel is ugly" - ever heard looks are subjective? I really like the design of the Google Pixel. More than the edge display on the Galaxy phones. h4rr4r Good you can fix the keys! Can you change the settings menu to be normal? Winston Nope, from my time with the S7. And I imagine that will soon be the new normal. Android O DP already has a similar design. So it will soon become normal. h4rr4r Please google, stop moving shit around for the sake of moving shit around. Winston You are the one moving shit around. I don't know what the hell the incentive is for lying, but I have a Galaxy S7. I have a Fast Charger. I have tried both turning the fast charger off in software, AND using a different cable. They both kept my phone cool while charging when using it, and with fast charging on it would heat up. h4rr4r I did not decide to move the buttons around at random or change the settings to some touchwiz crap. I have no idea what you are talking about with the charger. I said nothing about fast chargers. Of course fast chargers make the phone hotter. How do you think this all works? Winston It's not "considerable battery gains". They're actually fairly small: within 10-15 mins SOT in my experience. Samsung itself said, moving from the 5.7 1080p of the Note 3 to the 1440p of the 4, that the power usage delta was 3.5%. That's in hardware. Imagine how little the change is in software. lsh99 The build and design of this phone is exactly what I've been waiting for: premium finishes with a huge screen-to-body ratio. That said, I'm waiting for the Note 8. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Pricing, for Europe - 799EUR for S8, 899EUR for S8+. These should translate 1:1 to USD + taxes, for US. Of course, unlocked. Turb0wned The question is, if I ordered the US unlocked version from Best Buy, will Samsung screw me out of updates like they did with the unlocked S7E? Trysta After a major Samsung phone reveal, I usually spend the first couple days trying to rationalize how I could buy it even though touchwiz scares me, because the hardware is just so lust-worthy. But this time...not so much. It looks very fancy obviously, and I love the increased screen to body ratio (hopefully all other OEMs....*cough* Google *cough* are paying attention!). But I thought the Note 7, with the extra subtle curves was really the maximum amount of screen curve I was willing to deal with. The curve of the S8/S8+ seems to be going back towards obnoxious taking over 20% of the screen with glare again. Wish they had kept the curved edges the way they were on the Note 7. Batteries are too small, although I understand why they wanted to be careful this year. After my Nexus 6p disappointment, battery life is basically my number one feature for my next phone. And the fingerprint sensor placement is just awful, for seemingly no other reason than to be different from everyone else who has a back fingerprint sensor. I don't want to use iris scanning or face detection. Fingerprint sensors work really well for turning on my phone quickly. This is a major feature of all current flagships. Why did they think this was something that was ok to experiment with/mess up? But in the end, just like every year, I was never going to buy this phone anyway. I hope that it is a great phone for Samsung fans (I'm sure it will be). Shame-sung C.E.O Absolutely horrible looking phone.that it lacks innovation and nothing but gimmicky features. Dominic D ok it’s me tim-cock. As if anyone expect anything diffraction from you. Shame-sung C.E.O Why would anyone expect anything positive from a CORRUPT, thief company? Middlefinger Doesnt do thieving Apple or LG much harm though, or HTC with their new iPhone rip-offs. Shame-sung C.E.O You are mistaken the Corrupt Swinesung Machine that has been sued by. Apple,Dyson,BlackBerry,Microsoft,LG,TSMC And countless other manufactures for stealing. Hmm you sound like those Swinesung guys that were getting paid to Shill and got caught. You can only wish that Apple and LG and anyone else was as horrible as corrupt company as Swinesung. But unlike you i stand by Facts, go ahead and get upset. Not going to change history. : ) Middlefinger Selectively sued in countries with crap IP laws where you can patent anything vague and sue for it even if you never actually made the thing yourself. They failed to sue in countries with reasonable laws. Samsung also counter sued and won, so whatever... Shame-sung C.E.O That's a beautiful excuse. But not a good one. Funny how Swinesung has lost multiple times and agrees to settle after it has uses stolen designs and software and technology. Swingeing has lost all across the world from its home country to the the US. This is the problem with the fanboy mentality. They make poor excuses but everything is online. Swinesung has convicted 2 times of corruption in south korea alone. From Racketeering, Tax Evasion. Fraud and Embezzlement and countless other charges. Also they have the highest return in TV's in the industry with defects. Heck in the S7 and S6,5,4 have all suffered from low quality screens and having image retention issues (again all the information is online if you search) to burn in issues and lets not forget the exploding issues because they choose quantity over quality. Shamesung will always be just that. A low quality company who cares about numbers then quality. Middlefinger You're just a troll, yuor username proves that all by itself. Most of the thing Samsung have been sued for related directly to Android itself, so is Googles fault if anything, not anything they have done. You know this but just troll this site because you are a child with nothing better to do. Dont bother replying, your blocked as of now. Shame-sung C.E.O AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Facts hurt and hurt so dam much . Man how pathetic. Jay Not sure how your kind of comments continue to survive on this site. Shame-sung C.E.O Because people are entitled to facts and opinions. Just because Swinesung is a horrible corrupt company does not mean bling ignorance does not exist. I mean i like Android and think its amazing and useful, And i feel the same way about Apple , Microsoft LG ect. But Swinesung... Naw i draw the line on the most corrupt company in the tech industry by Parsec's. Dominic D I just wish Samsung would update all their devices at the same time like Apple. Okay, maybe not all... but definitely their S series of devices. It's holding me back from purchasing a Samsung phone again. My AT&T S6 Edge was beautiful but didn't receive Marshmallow for a year. It was nearly unusable on Lollipop with barely an hour and a half of screen-on time. I love my 6P and I'm soon looking to upgrade, but I'm nervous about purchasing another Samsung device. Berkay Wait for the pixel 2 Ilya Kushnir Linux Kernel 4.4.16. This happened! Maha Rashtrian TAKE MY MONEY NOW! How much does it cost though? Mix If Samsung made a phone with stock Android, that had Google's updates I would be in love. My Pixel is nice but Samsung phones just feel nicer. JSo Remember Google Play Edition devices? Those were the days. Mix I do not! My first was Android was a Nexus 4 and I came from a BB Bold! Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Galaxy S6, Pixel Xl, Pixel Xl, Pixel Xl....(I am on my third Pixel, lol) JSo Well other OEMs used to make versions of there devices with stock android on it and they were sold in the Play Store. The Galaxy S4 was one of them. Jaime May I ask why? Were your phones faulty? Mix Mic died on the 1st Pixel and the 2nd one bricked and both were RMA'd through the play store for brand new devices. someone755 "The Pixel is totally worth it, it's a great investment." You alone are proof of the contrary. Mix Just pop on over to GooglePixel on Reddit. Some people are on their 5th phone...when it works it works but my experience? This is the worst Android phone I have ever owned! My 3rd one has been great though so fingers crossed I am done RMA'ing it. someone755 Exactly. There are so many apologists out there of this phone that keep saying that the phone is worth its price, that other phones are just as flawed etc. Meanwhile there are hundreds if not thousands of customers like you. VAVAMk_2 Why? Mix Mic died on the 1st Pixel and the 2nd one bricked and both were RMA'd through the play store for brand new devices. Support has been great but my phone experience has been terrible. francoism My sister came from a BB Bold too. The initial part of pushing the contact onto Google was the only headache. Then on, it was smooth sailing. That was during the Galaxy S3 times. And for myself, months before her. Perplexed and intrigued by Android as a whole on my One X after making the move from the iPhone 3GS. I miss those times. 2kool4skool Agreed, google gets their software right but their hardware could use a lot of improvement. JohnyNoLegs Yea like messenger, allo, duo, hangouts. And pixel now has apps you can't uninstall. Google will be the next Samsung! 2kool4skool Well, should I say partly right, then? JohnyNoLegs Let's just say Samsung does it better than google recently, and that's saying something. Btw I'm on pixel xl coming from note 7. iKon Any phone looks better than the Pixels because #Bezels Bojan Radovanović well, that is true, but it's not a picture to stand in front of it and admire how it looks... Ra1nb0wD4sh DE On my pictures the bezels (aka frames) are mostly wanted though... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Samsung made the phone with stock Android, nobody except a bunch of geeks would buy it. Consumers want the features Samsung adds to Android. Mix Would the average user and purchaser of Samsung phones even know they had stock Android device? Probably not. Samsung makes mach better hardware but their updates and support after the sale freaking suck. Took something like 8 months for my SG6 phone to get an update since Google gives it to Samsung to add shit, then Telus gets to add shit, then I get it. That type of update system is pure trash. theProffer It's the same group of people that can't tell the difference between the new iPhones. You know, the ones Jimmy Kimmel makes fun of once a year. Middlefinger Samsung have to fix Googles mess first, because lets face it, Stock android is a buggy unreliable mess. You cant blame the OEMs for wanting to wait until the software is viable before they risk putting it on their customers devices. Google doesn't care, that's why the Nexus didnt sell well, and the pixel has needed fix after fix after fix. whispy_snippet No. Middlefinger Yes, but Google shills dont like to hear it. whispy_snippet Still no! Middlefinger Denial is pretty powerful. Jay Nothing in the pixel has been so broken, that's its stopped from being a consistent daily driver with over 6.5 hours SOT and over a day of standby. Issues have been present yes, but so have been with any phone. My iPhone 7+ ended up getting replaced twice... once because the damn camera unit entirely died 2 days later and secondly when the screen stopped responding. Then iOS 10.2 decided to suffer from Wi-Fi issues and all sorts of weird documented bugs. Nothing is ever 'PERFECT' However since that does not fit your narrative, it's not a thing. Middlefinger Most pixe issues are software/driver related, and thats always been the way with Google devices, although the Nexus range also had terrible build quality as well. At least the Pixel is better on that front. The problem is stock android, which is why the OEMs need to modify it to be production worthy. Im sure you will make excuses, but thats the reality. LineOS for exynos! What Better quality? The besel king! This and the iPhone Middlefinger Like it or not the Pixel is a step up over the likes of the N5, which was terrible. There was a reason the older Nexus devices were cheap, and it had nothing to do with Google 'subsidising' them. LineOS for exynos! Compared to Nexus the pixel are good but is nothing compar to Galaxy or even Huawei. The Nexus is meant to race with the iPhone.. in the meantime they​ only race to the biggest bezels Middlefinger I agree, but what i mean is purely construction quality. The Nexus was cheaply made, and it showed, especially the 4 and 5 and the tablets. The Samsungs pre-S6 were a bit cheap feeling, but at least they were made with good components and were reliable, the Nexus' were neither. whispy_snippet Well, no. Every average Joe consumer would buy it PLUS a heap of stock Android nerds. Average consumers don't have a freakin clue what TouchWiz or stock Android even are. Who gives a shit anyway. It's never going to happen. trapchan Nah, stock Android can't even block sms spam by phrase, and it took them how many years just to implement call blocking? I had it since iPhone 5. Middlefinger Oh god no. Bargain basement software that isnt reliable isnt what people want. Im sure even a stock S8 would have less issues than the trouble prone Nexus and Pixel phones, but even so, it would be commercial suicide for Samsung to rely on an unfiltered Google experience. someone755 It would net them a few thousand customers though. I know I'd be switching to a Samsung if they only made some AOSP-style software possible. Middlefinger Apple could probably sell more iPhones if they had an Android version, but it still doesnt mean it will happen. It would cheapen the Samsung brand to launch an AOSP version, and the only people that would care could just run a custom ROM anyway. someone755 Agreed on all but that last part -- That's why I'm not already a Samsung customer, as they make great efforts to prevent people from running custom ROMs. Middlefinger and yet suck ROM exist, so.. xyz It was called a Galaxy Nexus. JohnyNoLegs I prefer Samsung software. My pixel xl is barron, has nothing in comparison. Can't wait to sell and get the s8 gacl The Pure Google experience of Nexus + Pixel is nice, but Samsung hardware is nicer. A Google Play Edition Samsung would be better, but it's not that big a deal. TouchWiz is nice too. Cakefish The fact that I'm currently unemplyed will prevent me from giving in to my uncontrollable urges to always have the latest tech. S8 looks great. Switchable nav keys, 10nm processors, batteries that lose significantly less of their capacity over time. narrower dimensions for one-handed use, 64GB storage, and a Samsung equivalent to Google's HDR+ camera processing are my personal highlights. Cakefish P.S. for UK users you can get it on the 19th April if you preorder (8 days early). Also, UK pricing: S8 = £689.00, S8+ = £779.00 Middlefinger Yeah but will be cheap enough on contract which is how most people buy phones. Cakefish But I prefer to buy unlocked :( Lars Jeppesen Blame Brexit for that.. the phones are the same prices as the S7 for me here in Denmark Cakefish I do blame Brexit :( ddevito Nice phone, but no thanks. Perfectly comfy with my OP3. Then again I've never owned a Samsuck and never will james fuston jeeeesus the price point. S8 is anywhere from 720-750 and the S8+ is 850? We are getting dangerously close to breaking the 1K mark with standard configurations for phones. I can't justify paying twice the street price of an S7/S7E for one of these. This will be a hard pass for me. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The LG G6 is $750 and the Pixel XL is $869, and those two phones look pitiful compared to the S8 and S8 Plus. What are you complaining about? Cakefish 21% (S8 vs S7) and 22% (S8+ vs S7 edge) price rises for UK (thanks Brexit) hkklife Pixel XL is the biggest rip-off on the market that's not made by Apple. Google was redefining the $/performance ratio back in 2012 and 2013 with the Nexus 4/5 and Nexus 7s. And then they got greedy and cozied back up to the carriers and went sky-high with their pricing. I'd love to see the BoM for HTC and Google on the Pixels. Gotta give Samsung credit for not jettisoning important features while truly redefining what a rectangular slab handset should be. I still think that the S8 line is one step from greatness---an unlocked model updated in a timely fashion with a 6/128GB RAM/storage variant for all markets and a 500mAh battery boost would make it a world-beater. David Williams I agree. The price point should not be surprising to anyone. james fuston The Pixel XL is $779. Not sure where you're pulling that extra $100 from. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The 128 GB model is $869. There is no 64GB model. Regardless, the price differences aren't very big either way, and the Pixel XL doesn't hold a candle to the S8 Plus in terms of form OR function. james fuston Yeah, you're either entirely missing or intentionally glossing over the "standard configuration" part. Either way, I can tell you're all aboard the hype train for new technology by the amount of hyperbole you're spouting. Not sure why you felt like chiming in on my comment about the cost/value of the S8 vs the S7, but I think we're done here. Diego Kaku Why no one talks about the stupid position of the fingerprint scanner? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I hate the location of the fingerprint scanner on the S8/Plus. Absolutely despise it. But the rest of the phone is f'in amazing. And it's possible I'd end up using iris or facial recognition anyway. I'm not buying one, but that's only because I'm waiting for the Note 8. Fresh360 Well that was depressing, has all of those leaks left us jaded? What if there were no leaks and only whispers and then we saw a nearly bezel-less phone with a massive screen in a small body? I really think this preview would have had a very different tone. Suresh Aryal Nothing about speakers yet. GSMArena says it has stereo speakers. invinciblegod OH GOD MY OCD!! Those ports are not centered!!!!!!! Groud Frank Samsung Mobile is maturing as a tech company. It's no longer "Let's just copy Apple and cram features into our phones to compete with the iPhone." From Samsung Pass to Samsung Pay to Bixby to DeX, this is a beautiful phone with useful features. I can actually see this phone making my life easier, especially in the password management department. Less navigating, less touching, a focus on user experience and practicality - well done Samsung. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I think Samsung is going to break sales records with these phones. Max Gromada Well, they just "copied" those features: - google's HDR+, - the next iphone's screen proportions; - apple pay, - modern ai voice assistant (they've bought the company that had made the Siri), - apple's augmented reality tech - Nokia's / MS iris scanner. They're welcome to implement a feature-rich phone, but those innovations did not come from Samsung. Tech Writer -Combining multiple photos into one has been a thing much before google did it. Does anyone remember OPPO's 50MP super hi-def mode? Plus I'm sure the implementation is different than Pixel's HDR+. For example, this one works without HDR, and with HDR too. -Next iPhone's screen proportions? Dude, are you kidding me. Samsung is the one who is going to provide those screens to Apple. Plus, this phone is probably in development much before the iPhone. -Apple pay: No. Samsung pay uses MST, not NFC. It's a unique patented tech by looppay, which Samsung acquired. Apple can't even use it and hence Apple pay can't operate in legacy terminals. -modern ai voice assistant: Bixby is not a voice assistant. The phone has google assistant for that. Bixby is more of helper and tells you what is around you. It isn't meant to tell you a joke or search things, you have assistant for that. -apple's augmented reality tech: I really don't know what you are talking about. -Iris scanner: I'll give you that. Most of these are Samsung's own innovations, or acquisitions which are patented. Max Gromada Tech Writer, man, combining multiple photos into one has been a thing since the invention of photography ) It's just Google that made it ideal for the phones - combining multiple pics of several milliseconds of exposure into one is a brilliant idea, it greatly expands the dynamic range of small sensors, and i think every manufacturer should just copy that tecnique. Doesn't matter if they call it "hdr" or not. It improves dr, that's all we need. No, i'm not kidding - some time ago, Apple approached Koreans with the question if they could supply the screens of some specs - and voila - while Apple is still playing with the idea, figuring out if the screen should be curved or not, and how the f.. are they going to install the fingerprint scanner right into the screen... the Koreans just rolled out the phones of very similar screen proportions. I don't think this is just a coincidence. Call it a controversial bull..it ) The idea behind Apple pay was simply to pay by phone conveniently. Dunno, maybe Samsung's tech is better, but they were following Apple. I think augmented reality features are the next big thing for smartphones. Project Tango did not start well, but apple is working on it, samsung is working on it - NOT a coincidence. I don't argue with the point that Samsung is a great tech company. The point of my comment was that Samsung is still some way into "Let's copy Apple and cram features into our phones to compete with the iPhone." They definitely are set into direct competition with iphone, and at this moment, from my point of view, there are no features that apple would like to copy from samsung to compete with it. Blomsternisse I think (and hope) that most of his claims were just just jokes. Groud Frank "The next iPhone". They copied features from a phone that doesn't even exist? Are you serious? Dude, stop making a fool of yourself😂 Middlefinger Quite a bit of salt in this article. Samsungs nav buttons are not in the 'wrong' order, Googles are. Argue all you like but the fact remains its subjective and not objective. Im glad Samsung doesnt use Googles staid UX. and you cant complain about Samsung not being as innovative in the software as they are in the hardware and simultaneously get snarky about them not using Googles way of doing things. Google hasnt innovated a damn thing since ICS so if they did make a stock S8 it would be worse, based on your own claim. dabug91 Actually, you're wrong. When you use just about any web browser on the planet, where is the back button located? Top Left. Same for when you use just about any file explorer: Top Left. Same for when you use iOS devices, where do they generally place the back button? Top Left. It makes perfect sense for the back button to be on the left side of the device, because that IS the ergonomically and aesthetically superior place for it. You're wrong, get over yourself. Middlefinger Use with a mouse is different than touch use, and 2 handed touch use is different than one. You are comparing completely different UI element, so your point is invalid. dabug91 Actually, people's thumbs can very easily reach the bottom left hand side of their device, so your distraction about UI's is invalid and you're still wrong. Kys. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I hold my phone in my left hand, and use it with my right hand. The position of the back button makes no difference to me, but I like it on the right. It's not an objective thing. Give up trying to make it so. Middlefinger Right is still better for the most often used function. Given the option most people I know have that set up. Google cant be trusted to know whats best in a UI. This is the company that gave us material design, an admittedly pretty interface that gives you hardly any information per page. Its cumbersome, and this is proven by the fact that they cant even keep it consistent in their own apps, because it just doesnt work properly. Max Gromada Regarding 2-handed touch use, find the "Esc" key on your keyboard ) But, imho, when you're doing it all with your thumb, it does not matter what side the "back" key is placed. I was comfortable with the both layouts. trapchan Do you even realize that Backspace key is always placed on the right side of the keyboard, and not on the left side? You point is invalid, get over it. dabug91 The escape key, which also has a function of backing out of something is always placed on the left-hand side. The back button in Android is akin to an escape key, not a backspace key, dumbass. Your point is invalid. Get over it. AbbyZFresh I'm sure that this new phone will be a hot commodity likurges I was about to make a joke about the bezzels but there are none.. unlike on the pixel where I have parked my airplane, built a house and a f1 track with some space left. SAM While improvements are welcomed, battery and camera didn't get much attention this year. Lets hope after everything other is taken care of this year, battery and camera will be next. I have a feeling that with what google achieved in pixel's camera, next iPhone(maybe) and pixel 2 will blow the shit out of competition. Max Gromada Actually, the camera is improverd in S8: there is a multi-exposure mode, aka pixel's HDR+, a very welcome feature. SAM I really wish this is the case. They didn't talk much about camera in live stream. Ace Time to buy gs7 _jsw_ Is that the new Gear 360 I see in the background? It's in the image of the S8+ on the stand. Max Gromada Yes, they've introduced the new Gear 360 someone755 That's all great and all, but these prices are getting ridiculous. r0xp0x Too bad even the regular sized one is a tad bit too big for me, and I don't like having a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, but it sure is gorgeous. whispy_snippet The headline feature is a big, bezzeless display. Meh. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, never mind the 835, the two types of wireless charging, the Samsung Pay, the HDR screen, the... oh, never mind. You wouldn't care, anyway. whispy_snippet No. I don't. They're just iterations on stuff Samsung always offers. They bring very little to the table that wasn't already there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Then buy a Pixel. You'll love its football field sized bezels, and the wonderful halos in its pictures. Yeah, I keep hearing that halos are rare. Another site just published a comparison of 22 pictures between the LG G6 and the Pixel. 4 of the 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the G6 pictures had halos. So it's not so rare, unless you think 18% of photos is rare. whispy_snippet I have a Pixel. I've experienced the halo effect maybe twice ever. I barely see it because you don't generally shoot straight into strong light sources because it results in crappy shots with any camera. The most important thing for me is user experience. What's the device like to use and own on a daily basis? The Pixel is exceptional in this metric. Great software, great ergonomics, great camera, regular updates, excellent performance. The S8 looks really beautiful, but I see UX compromises everywhere. The off centre, rear mounted fingerprint scanner next to the camera; the glass back; the curved edge display; two voice assistants (yes, they don't fully overlap but Samsung's end goal will be to bump Google Assistant). The S8 is just another new phone. Semianonymous Having voice control over the camera can actually be pretty useful. I have the speak to capture feature enabled on my S7 and it's enabled me to capture some tricky shots that might not have turned out as nicely if I had moved my hand to take the shot. If it's intelligent enough to do stuff like recognize the target and focus/zoom etc, then that could be potentially be really cool. Renan I'd wish Samsung would made a flat version of this... I find the Edge... edges useless. mchalakov Dear Samsung, Just because you think that a curved screen is really cool(it is but just for a presentation) doesn't mean that everybody will like it. Also who the fuck decided it's a good idea to put the fingerprint reader there? Best wishes and less explosions, Yours (some) part of the Internet PVL_93_RU To think that if Samsung didn't keep the archaic home and capacitive buttons for as long as they did - many more of their devices could look just as beautiful as S8 Teja The best thing I like about S8 is that they have made it without compromising on any of the features from their last generation despite having a big change in design. *cough* Headphone Jack *cough* Rocket Can I give this post more than one like? Stadi I don't like the polished frame. Shiny metal has been out of fashion for some time. gacl I'm disappointed the S8 has no s-pen stylus support. It seems like Samsung deliberately withheld that to justify a separate Note8, but the Note line is basically the same as the Galaxy line. The S8+ is already a phablet. Just merge the two. Or at least let Galaxy users get s-pen support even if the device doesn't hold the pen internally. trapchan kinda underwhelming. no under screen fingerprint sensor, same kind of screen as LG G6, same camera as S7, and the "scream quality" thing is not even close to iPhone. Compare the charging port and speaker hole side by side, and you'll know which one "scream quality". Đức Thành It certainly looks nice, but I have a feeling it's still more gimmicky than functional. For example, most people would have this phone in a case, because if they don't, it's going to scratch very easily—so there's no real point to it looking that pretty. And those curved edges look great, but does it make it more useful or less? I'd say less, and a few drops will prove how this was not the best choice to make. I understand why Samsung decided to go with these, though, much in the same vein they go with the current approach to software: They need to sell products, and this is a marketing strategy that seems to be working quite well. That's not to say there isn't a better approach, though. This will take time, but eventually when people have wised up, the products themselves will also turn into more rational choices for consumers. francoism Thank you addressing one of my biggest concerns with the Samsung devices! Their updates take forever to get pushed out and it always bugged me so much. I can't wait for the Pixel 3 (sorry not sorry if being overly ambitious here) but when my contract is over next year, I'll just get an iPhone to sell off and sell that off to get that. Rocket I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-TouchWiz I can see that on a Samsung advertisement in the I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Butter font.

The Washington Post reports Google recently released a report called It's Lit: A Guide to What Teens Think Is Cool after surveying around 1,100 youths between the ages of 13 and 17. “Teens feel something is cool if it’s unique, impressive, interesting, amazing, or awesome," the Verge quotes from It's Lit. YouTube (the coolest brand, according to teens), Netflix, Google, Oreos, Doritos, and Nike apparently all fit the bill. The Wall Street Journal was found to be the least cool brand with teens. "Well kids, the bond market doesn't think you're cool either," WSJ reporter Mike Bird responded on Twitter (also not very cool with teens). While some of the coolness rankings were expected—Coke is cooler than Pepsi, obviously—others were fairly shocking. Who would have thought teens found JC Penney cooler than Red Bull? Perhaps more suspicious than shocking: A survey conducted by Google found two of the three coolest brands are Google and Google-owned YouTube. Observer reports It's Lit basically turns into "native advertising for Google." For example, the report quotes one 17-year-old girl: "Google is ... great at everything it does, from email to documents. Google products are easy to use and work well." Possibly goosing your own survey results? Even teens must think that's uncool.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   25% Hilarious 19% Intriguing 5% Depressing 6% Brilliant 6% Scary 40% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 19 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 19 comments hneftafl 2 hours, 4 minutes ago Did Google also determine which generation is the most shallow, vapid and sold-out to corporations?

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment.

There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

In order to become Mobile Sites certified you’ll have to pass an exam which tests one’s expertise in key areas of mobile website development. Successful completion of the exam grants developers with a printable certificate, as a listing on their Google Partners profile showing they’ve passed them exam. The exam, which consists of 65 multiple choice & true and false questions, covers basic to advanced concepts. Those taking the exam are given 90 minutes to complete it, and are required achieve a score of at least 80% in order to pass. ”The Mobile Sites exam covers basic, technical and advanced concepts, including best practices for creating, managing, measuring, and optimizing mobile sites. We recommend that you have on-the-job experience creating mobile sites to increase your chances of passing.” Mobile Sites Study Guide Developers won’t have to rely solely on their on-the-job experience to pass the exam. Google has provided a study guide which developers can review to further increase their chances of passing. The study guide consists of the following 4 modules: Mobile sites and why they matter Improving mobile site speed Creating an effective mobile UX Advanced web technologies A entire module being dedicated to site speed should be an indication of how important site speed is in this day an age. It’s also worth noting that the exam doesn’t test one’s knowledge of developing for any particular operating system. It’s strictly a test of one’s mobile website expertise in general. While Google emphasizes this is an exam for marketers, there’s nothing stopping digital marketers and SEOs from taking the exam as well. It’s certainly an accreditation befitting of anyone who works with mobile websites in any fashion.

Wait, doesn’t Google already have customer reviews in search results? In a way, yes. Users have long been able to leave reviews on a business’s Google listing, which are then displayed in search results. However, it would be more apt to call those “Google reviews.” What’s the difference between “Google reviews” and “Customer Reviews”? The key difference between the two review types are that “Customer Reviews” are verified to have been left by customers who have legitimately made a purchase from the business’s website. Therefore, this review type is reserved only for businesses with an online store. “Google reviews” can be left for any type of business, and can technically be left by anyone whether they’re a real customer or not. With “Customer Reviews”, participating businesses can also customize the look of their badge, and receive more detailed insights: ”Google Customer Reviews offers more ways to customize the Google badge and opt-in on your site, better account management tools that save your time, and new insights into your seller rating.” The service is completely free, all it requires is a Merchant Center account. A quick sign-up process will then allow you to have customers to opt-in to receiving an email survey after they complete a purchase. The survey is designed for customers to review their buying experience, and the data will be used to help create a seller rating for your Merchant Center account. Seller ratings can then be shown on Google Shopping, AdWords text ads, and your own website. According to Google, “Showing seller ratings on your text ads can boost your ads’ click through rate by up to 10%.” Google Customer Reviews are currently available in the United States, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan and Australia. Here’s how to enable Google Customer Reviews Sign in to your Merchant Center account (or sign up if you do not have an account). Select “Merchant Center programs” from the dropdown in the upper right-hand corner. Click “Get Started” in the Google Customer Reviews card and accept the Program Agreement. Add the survey opt-in code to your website. Once the opt-in code is added, you then have the option to add the badge code for display on your website wherever you want. The bade will display your seller rating, as well as indicate to customers that your store is integrated with Google Customer Reviews.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

Alix Tichelman, 30, completed a jail sentence for involuntary manslaughter on March 29 and was turned over to Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Santa Cruz, California. “Ms. Tichelman was taken into custody by deportation officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) March 29,” ICE spokesman James Schwab said in a statement to The Post. “Department of Homeland Security databases indicate Ms. Tichelman has multiple prior criminal convictions, including convictions for involuntary manslaughter and a felony drug charge. She will remain in DHS/ICE custody pending removal proceedings.” Court documents incorrectly state that the 30-year-old is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada. Tichelman, who holds a U.S. green card, was living in California when she was charged for the accidental heroin overdose of Google executive Forrest Timothy Hayes aboard in 2013. Schwab told news station KSBW that officials would not detain or deport anyone with American citizenship. In 2015, Tichelman was sentenced to five years in jail for injecting Hayes with heroin and then leaving him to die on his yacht. She was released early from Santa Cruz jail for good behavior. The 30-year-old remains in ICE custody at a Yuba County facility.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

SMX West: Solving SEO Issues in Google’s Post-Update World Now that Google no longer regularly announced algorithm updates, it can be hard to tell when your site's been hit by one. Luckily, there are steps you can take to determine if you've been hit. Contributor Mark Traphagen sums up a session from SMX West on this topic. Mark Traphagen on April 4, 2017 at 2:21 pm More How do we deal with huge and sudden changes in organic search traffic now that Google no longer posts major updates to its algorithms? Since many updates that formerly would have been assigned a name (like Penguin or Panda), or even a name and an incremental number (Panda 3.0) are now part of Google’s core algorithm, how can we know when an update is responsible for a traffic or ranking change? And even if we do know, what can we do with that knowledge? Kristine Schachinger and Glenn Gabe answered those questions and more in “Solving SEO Issues In Google’s Post-Update World,” a session at SMX West 2017. The following is a summary of their presentations. Busting Google’s black box Presenter: Kristine Schachinger, @schachin Some SEOs and webmasters may find themselves wishing for the days of Matt Cutts. Cutts was a Google engineer and the head of Google’s webspam team. More importantly to marketers, Matt was the “face” of Google search, regularly speaking at conferences, creating informative videos and posting news about Google search on social media. During Cutts’ tenure at Google, he could usually be depended upon to provide announcements of major algorithm updates. Then two things happened: Matt Cutts left Google to serve with the US Digital Service, and Google stopped announcing most algorithm updates. Since Cutts’ departure, the role of Google spokesperson has been split among several Googlers, most prominently Gary Illyes and John Mueller. But these new spokespeople don’t fulfill the same role as Matt Cutts, and they don’t necessarily have his level of insight into the algorithms (Cutts actually helped write the search algorithms). Illyes and Mueller have seemed more reluctant than Cutts was to confirm or speak about possible updates. In addition, Google announced that many key updates had been “rolled up” into the core algorithm. That meant that they would be regularly tweaked, but there would no longer be major updates that would be announced. Other changes have affected the ability of SEOs and webmasters to assess whether changes to their traffic are the result of Google updates. For example, Penguin is now real-time, which means it finds questionable links during normal crawls and devalues them as it crawls the sites to which they link. Gone are the days when webmasters had to wait, sometimes for months or even years, for the next major update of Penguin before their sites could recover from a penalty. But that also means it’s less easy to assess whether Penguin is to blame for a traffic loss. Did you get burned? So now, when a webmaster or SEO notices a sudden drop in organic search traffic, the question of whether an update by Google (and which one, if any) is to blame is a lot harder to answer. Fortunately, there are third-party sites and SEOs who keep track of major fluctuations in ranking and serve as a “first alert” network for possible algorithm updates. Schachinger recommended following these: Glenn Gabe Google Webmaster Central Blog Gary Illyes John Mueller Search Engine Roundtable (Barry Schwartz) The SEM Post (Jennifer Slegg) Maybe yes, maybe no However, the fact that an update may have happened on or near the date of your traffic or ranking loss does not mean the update was to blame. You need to become a detective, and first eliminate all other possible causes. Treat your site history like a medical history. For example, if you’ve had a problem with bad links in the past, you might still have it (or have it again). You need to beware of falling for “ducks” (just because it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck…). For example, this looks like a penalty: However, a deeper investigation into the analytics history reveals that this is a normal seasonal dip that takes place every year: The bigger picture We’re never going to achieve perfection in our SEO, since we can never know exactly all the factors that affect ranking and traffic behavior. So our aim should be to measure our “distance from perfect” (a concept coined by Portent Digital Marketing). That is, try to determine how close or far your site is from the ideals a search algorithm looks for. First ask which (if any) algorithms might be affecting your site. Internal algorithms (on-page, technical, etc.) Panda, Phantom, Penguin External algorithms (links, citations, etc.) Penguin Third-party influence algorithms (ads, etc.) Panda, Phantom Let’s look at some of those core algorithms in a bit more detail. Panda This algorithm update is focused primarily on content quality, but also some elements of site quality. The last confirmed Panda update was in October of 2015. According to Gary Illyes of Google, Panda is now part of Google’s core ranking algorithm. Here is what you need to know about Panda and content quality: Frowns on “thin” content. Length of content can matter (as a signal of time, effort and completeness), but there are exceptions. Duplicate content: NOT a penalty, but it does confuse Google as to which page you want to have ranking. Make sure all your titles and descriptions are unique. Content clarity: make sure all your content is well-written and focused on its topic. Content specificity: make sure content is relevant to your key topics. Content length (these are all rough suggestions, not hard and fast rules!) Blog posts should be about 35–550 words. In-depth articles 750 words+. Content technical issues: grammar, spelling, readability Site architecture problems (confirmed by John Mueller in February 2017) Too many advertisements on page, especially if they make it difficult to find the content Site load time: especially TFB (time to first byte). Should be under .80ms. Phantom Phantom was the name given by SEOs to an unnamed Google quality update. Phantom is sometimes referred to as “Panda Plus.” It has a wider quality focus than Panda, including UX/UI issues. Similar to Panda, Phantom focuses on low-quality pages, though it can change its focus from time to time — it acts as a sort of catch-all quality algorithm. Updates are typically not confirmed by Google. Likely areas Phantom goes after: Aggressive ad placements Content issues Crawl issues Deceptive ads, hidden affiliate links, any attempts to deliberately deceive visitors Thin content Bad UI/UX Interstitials Panda or Phantom? How can you know? The easy answer: it doesn’t matter! Remember, your goal should always be to reduce your “distance from perfect.” Assess your site by the things we know Google looks for in a good site, and adjust accordingly. Penguin Originally launched in April 2012, Penguin focuses primarily on spammy or “unnatural” links, but it includes some other site quality factors as well. Penguin updates 1.0–3.0 were “angry.” They went after the rankings of entire sites, and a penalized site could not recover until the next update, which could take months, or even years. Penguin 4.0 was a gift, by comparison. It is now “real-time” (not instant, but demotions and recoveries take place at the time of a site recrawl), and granular, meaning Penguin affects single pages and not the whole site. Gary Illyes noted that this update now devalues spam rather than demoting a site’s rank. Real-time Penguin is good news, since adjustments occur as soon as the page is crawled; however, Penguin is now harder to detect, since now only individual pages or sections of a site will drop in ranking, not the whole site. Your pages can also be hit by an indirect Penguin effect, if some of the pages that link to them are hit by Penguin. The links from those pages to your pages will no longer pass along the ranking power they once did. The only way to really recover now if Penguin impacts pages on your site is to get quality links to those pages to replace the ones that Penguin devalued. Google says you should still disavow any bad links to your site that you find, but they don’t say why. Manual penalties Sites can still be given manual penalties. Manual penalties occur when suspicious links and/or poor site quality or other search manipulations bring a site up for review by human assessors at Google. A manual penalty can still affect a whole site. Manual penalties still require action to remediate the problem, and recovery requires a request for reconsideration. Mobile updates If you’re noticing specific issues with mobile traffic only, it might be due to a mobile algorithm update. Here are the main ones to keep track of: Mobile-friendly update For the last couple of years, Google has evaluated sites according to their “mobile-friendliness,” meaning that the site’s presence on mobile devices presents a good user experience. A “mobile-friendly” label used to appear next to sites that met this threshold in the search results, but no longer does. Google has announced two “mobile-friendly” algorithm updates so far, which allegedly devalue the ranking of non-mobile-friendly sites in mobile search results. Intrusive ads & interstitials update In August 2016, Google announced that it would begin to devalue the mobile rankings of sites that had certain kinds of interstitials that prevented users from being able to immediately see the actual content upon page load. In January 2017, they confirmed that the update had rolled out. So far, the rollout has been weak. The interstitial penalty applies to the first click from a search results page only. Interstitials that load as a user navigates to other pages on the same site will not trigger the penalty. Types of interstitials this update is supposed to be aimed at: Popups that cover the main content, either immediately after a page opens from a search result or while scrolling down that first page. Standalone interstitials that must be dismissed before the user can view the content. Layouts where the above-the-fold appearance acts as the equivalent of an interstitial, and the actual content must be scrolled to. Some interstitials are not affected by the update and are still allowed: Interstitials required for legal obligations, such as informing the user of cookie use or for age verification. Login dialogs for non-public content requiring a password for access. Banners that use a reasonable amount of screen space and are easily dismissed, such as the app install banners provided by Safari and Chrome. Final thoughts Keep decreasing your “distance from perfect” as your aim and you should not have to worry about algorithmic penalties. Remember that Google has said that content and links to your site are its two highest ranking factors. Work hard to maintain high quality with both. Assess your content quality according to the EAT acronym in Google’s quality guidelines: Expertise, Authority and Trust. The technical SEO health of your site could be considered ranking factor “2.5.” Often just eliminating technical problems can result in a traffic increase. Pay attention to increasing the speed of your site, especially on mobile. Use WebpageTest.org and Google’s Pagespeed Insights to test the speed of your site. Keep up to date on Google’s plans for mobile-first indexing. Mobile-first indexing is Google’s plan to eventually base its rankings for both mobile and desktop on the mobile version of sites. This means that you must have all the content for which you want to rank available in the version of your site visible on mobile sites. If you have a mobile m. site, make sure it is verified in Google Search Console. If you have a responsive site, no changes are needed. If you have AMP content only, you will be evaluated on your desktop content, but with a mobile-friendly boost. Unlike desktop, content hidden in accordions or tabs will not be devalued. If your site removes schema from mobile pages, you must add it back in order to get search snippets. Busting Google's Black Box: Navigating Google Algorithms in a Post-Update World By Kristine Schachinger from Search Marketing Expo – SMX How to Track Unconfirmed Algorithm Updates Presenter: Glenn Gabe, President G-Squared Interactive @glenngabe The one constant of Google is that change is constant. Google pushes out between 500 and 1,000 changes every year. Some of those are major, most are minor. We also need to be aware that Google will sometimes roll out multiple updates at the same time. Most algorithm updates are not announced, and these days that includes even the major ones. We were lucky to at least have Phantom (a name created by Gabe, but adopted by the SEO industry) confirmed in May 2015. A few updates are pre-announced, especially ones that Google wants to use to change webmaster behavior, such as the Mobile-Friendly and Mobile Interstitial updates. But most are neither announced nor confirmed. So, how do we keep track of updates? We have to assemble a mixture of human “barometers” and technology to identify major updates. Keep an ear to the ground and use the following as your alert system: Your own data and rank tracking Search Engine Roundtable SEOs who focus on algo updates (such as Gabe) Third-party search visibility tools Twitter chatter in the SEO community Webmaster forums SEO weather-tracking tools (such as Mozcast) It’s important to note the date when you saw any radical change in your rankings and traffic, as you may be able to correlate that with any updates noted by the sources above. Major updates still occur every few months. How to prepare for battle with updates You should have the right data and tools at hand to help you assess if updates have affected your site. Use third-party data to supplement your own. Also gather and track data from your niche (SEMrush is Gabe’s favorite tool for seeing this data from competitive sites). Be proactive, not reactive; try to spot possible problems before they get out of hand. Be sure to track your ranking as well. Select a strong bucket of keywords from your niche. You need way more than your “top 10.” Track your competition as well. You’re looking for movement across an entire niche, not just your own site. Use tools like SEMrush, STAT, RankRanger, Moz or others to do this. But no matter how intensive your efforts, you can’t rank-track the entire web. Tools such as SEMRush, SearchMetrics and Sistrix, however, do monitor many thousands of sites across the web, and so can show more accurately when major fluctuation in ranking is occurring. Algorithm weirdness Sometimes Google will reverse a previous algorithm update. Or there can be “tremors” after a major update, in which some sites initially go down but after some corrections to the algorithm, go back up again. Sometimes algorithm updates don’t work as expected. For example, Google’s mobile interstitial update was launched on January 10, 2017 (See description in Kristine Schachinger’s presentation above). Gabe has tracked over 70 sites that should have been penalized by the update but has seen no widespread movement at all. The Mobile Interstitial Update appears to be a dud (so far). Using Google tools and your own data Nothing is better than your own data, particularly from Google Search Console (GSC) and your own analytics. Both GSC and Google Analytics have APIs, so you can download data to do your own more detailed analysis. You can also automate certain tasks so you are taking a regular pulse (more about that below). Google Search Console In Google Search Console, you’ll want to focus on the Search Analytics report. Track your clicks and impressions over time. Also watch Average Position (though that can be a bit funky) over time to identify increases and decreases in ranking. Here’s an example of a gradual decrease in ranking during a recent core ranking update: In Google Search Console, you can also compare time frames to one another and sort by loss of clicks or impressions. Just be aware that there is a limitation of 1,000 rows per report. Now it’s time to slice and dice your data. Isolate areas of your site by filtering the Pages group, or isolate keywords by filtering the Queries group. You can then view trends in the filtered data. GSC does not support Regex, but you can export the data to do your own manipulations. Gabe shared that his favorite tool for bulk-exporting GSC data is Analytics Edge. With this tool, you can download queries and landing pages way beyond GSC’s 1,000-page limit, and then use the power of Excel to dig deeper. Gabe has written two blog posts about this process, here and here. Rich snippets and algorithm updates Rich Snippets are featured search results that display data or content from your page as part of the result. They also can be affected by algo updates. You can track your site’s appearance in rich snippets by using the GSC Search Appearance group and filtering by “rich results.” You can also check the SERP Features widget in SEMrush to see if your rich snippets have been impacted by an algorithm update. For example, this feature will show you the number of times reviews are showing up for your domain, and the keywords that are triggering those reviews. Google Analytics First and foremost, make sure you are isolating Google organic traffic. You can also check organic search channel reporting for unsampled data (although that will include all search engines). Here’s an example of a site that had been hit by Panda 4.0 but experienced a surge during the February 7, 2017, core ranking update: Now it’s time to dig deeper, to the level of your individual pages. Dimension by landing pages, check the trends, and compare what you see to the previous time frame. Filtering is key here. You can filter by directory (or via page type). In the advanced filters under advanced search, you can use regular expressions as well. If you think you’ve been hit by Panda, it’s smart to check the landing pages from organic search where traffic dropped. Often you’ll see glaring problems on those pages, and then you’ll know what to fix. Gabe wrote a tutorial for running such a report in Excel that you can use for any update. Other search engines Another source to check in trying to confirm an algo update and its possible effects is search engines other than Google. Since these updates are unique to Google, if you see a parallel drop in traffic on both Google and Bing (for example), it probably indicates a technical problem with your site, and not a penalty or algorithm change. And remember to segment out Google from all other organic traffic. Of course, what you see in GSC is all Google. Mobile SERPs and traffic You should also look at your mobile organic search traffic separately. If all the drop is there, then you have a problem with how your mobile site is set up, or with one of Google’s mobile-specific updates (Mobile Friendly, Interstitials, and in the future, Mobile First Indexing). In GSC, use the devices group to check clicks and impressions from mobile devices. Compare this to your desktop results, and be sure to include average position in your assessment. In Google Analytics, create a segment for mobile traffic, then use that segment to assess with the recommendations made above. If you find that mobile pages dropped more than desktop pages, dig in and find out why. A final word about ‘Fred’ An apparent major update that happened around February 7, 2017, is a good case study in how these updates look now, and what kind of response we can expect from Google. On that date, many sites surged, while others tanked. Almost all the tools mentioned earlier showed large volatility on or around that date, so it was easy to see. Initially, no one at Google would confirm the update, but when several on Twitter pressed Gary Illyes about it, he jokingly named it “Fred” after one of his pet fish, and the name stuck. Here’s an example of two sites impacted by Fred in opposite ways: Final tips and recommendations Be proactive, not reactive. Use a multifaceted approach for tracking algorithm updates. Set up rank tracking. Monitor search visibility across your niche. Track those “human barometers,” and let them know if you think you see something significant. Monitor industry chatter. Leverage the full power of Google tools (GSC and GA). Surface your quality problems, fix them, and always work to improve your overall quality. Keep moving forward and wait for the next update (could be months away).

The problem with obsessive rank tracking Search engine optimization (SEO) is often focused on achieving high rankings in search results pages. But columnist Ryan Shelley explains why this mindset may steer us wrong. Ryan Shelley on April 4, 2017 at 3:48 pm More Keyword ranking is one of the most overrated and misused metrics in SEO. Yes, tracking your positions is important, but placing too much emphasis on this metric is problematic. When it comes to SEO, what you measure gets managed. That means that focusing on the right metrics will help you generate results that have a business impact, rather than an ego boost. So, let’s talk about the problem with obsessing over rank — and what metrics you’d be better off focusing on. The problem with rank tracking Measuring keyword ranking is easy to get sucked into because it’s so visible. When you type in the all-powerful keyword and see your listing there at the top, it feels good. The problem with putting too much emphasis on this metric is that the search results aren’t always consistent. Google’s results will vary based on a number of different criteria. Let’s look at the two most common. Location. Your search results are tailored to the location from which you are searching. This plays a big role in local search, of course, but it impacts organic rankings as well. Let’s say you are in a new city, and you are looking for a coffee shop; if you search for “coffee shops,” it will display results near you. If you were to do the same search in your hometown, the results would be very different. Personalization. Google and the other search engines are constantly collecting information on how you personally search. They use this information to serve you with more relevant results. If you have a Google, Bing, Yahoo or other search-connected account, they will look at your browser history and navigational behaviors and alter the SERPs to best match your preferences. As you can see, these two simple variables can drastically impact rankings. In order to get a 100 percent accurate idea of your aggregated rank, you would have to check, monitor and scan all of these inconsistencies across the web. While not an impossible task, it’s certainly difficult and time-consuming — and probably not an efficient use of your time. In addition to being hard to accurately track, rankings are also not the best measure of success. In “The Art of SEO,” the authors write that “obsessing over rankings (rather than traffic) can result in poor strategic decisions.” So many people spend so much time obsessing over their search engine rankings that the other more important areas suffer. Just imagine the results if that time were spent creating an engaging piece of content that drove traffic and conversions. The other issue is that a majority of searches are long-tail keywords and phrases. It’s estimated that 70 to 80 percent of the demand curve is made up of long-tail keywords. These terms are not only easier to rank for, but they also tend to drive very targeted traffic. Here are a few other great stats from a recent report done by Ahrefs: One-word keywords account for only 2.8 percent of all the keywords people search for (in the United States). 96.54 percent of all search queries in the US have fewer than 50 searches per month. So instead of obsessing about where you rank for the more competitive terms, focus on creating a strategy that encompasses a variety of powerful long-tail terms. This will lead to more targeted traffic from users who actually want to engage with you. So, what should you focus on? The goal of any SEO or marketing strategy should be to impact the bottom line. Targeted traffic is the key here, and it starts with keyword research. As I shared above, there is huge potential in targeting long-tail opportunities. These terms tend to be more specific and focused. Using these terms as your foundation, you can create and execute a strategy to drive more targeted visitors to your site. More targeted visitors usually translates into more conversions or transactions. Today’s analytics tools can reveal powerful data on our users and how our sites are performing in search. Understanding where and how people find you online, as well as your traffic trend (up or down), is much more important than knowing where you rank. Google Analytics is free, so there is no excuse not to monitor your traffic. I recommend doing this at least weekly so you have a good understanding of where you stand and whether or not your efforts are working. Sadly, not everyone takes advantage of these tools. While tracking traffic may not be as sexy as tracking rank, I can promise it’s much more lucrative in the long run. Many site owners and marketers would rather focus on the flashy metrics instead of the right ones, and I’ve got stats to back that up. Only 22 percent of marketers say they have data-driven marketing initiatives that are achieving significant results. (Source: Forbes Insights and Turn) 84 percent of marketers cannot measure and report on the contribution of their programs to the business. (Source: ITSMA/Vision Edge Marketing) Only 21 percent of marketers are employing analytics to measure marketing ROI for all marketing engagement. (Source: Forbes Insights and Turn). So instead of obsessing over metrics that have little significance, give yourself an edge by tracking what actually has an impact on your business. Spend time setting up conversion goals, and pay attention to what is driving traffic to your site. If you obsess over driving targeted traffic, you will always beat those who obsess over rank.

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA: Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic or terrorist videos, its engineers realised computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing with videos from extremist groups and other offensive matter. That ads bought by well known companies can occasionally appear next to offensive videos has long been considered a nuisance to YouTube’s business. But the issue has gained urgency in recent weeks, as much has been written about brands that inadvertently fund extremists through automated advertising — a byproduct of a system in which You-Tube shares a portion of ad sales with creators of the content those ads appear against. This glitch in the company’s giant, automated process turned into a public-relations nightmare. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson said they would pull their ads from YouTube, as well as Google’s display advertising business, until they could get assurances that such placement would not happen again. Consumers watch more than a billion hours on YouTube every day, making it an obvious beneficiary as advertising money moves online from television. But the recent problems opened Google to criticism that it was not doing enough to look out for advertisers. It is a significant problem for a multibillion-dollar company that still gets most of its revenue through advertising. "We take this as seriously as we’ve ever taken a problem," Philipp Schindler, Google chief business officer, said . "We’ve been in emergency mode." Over the last two weeks, Google has changed what types of videos can carry advertising, barring ads from appearing with hate speech or discriminatory content. In addition, Google is simplifying how advertisers can exclude specific sites, channels and videos across YouTube and Google’s display network. It is allowing brands to fine-tune the types of content they want to avoid, such as "sexually suggestive" or "sensational/bizarre" videos. It is also putting in more stringent safety standards by default, so an advertiser must choose to place ads next to more provocative content. Google created an expedite way to alert it when ads appear next to offensive content. Google’s efforts are being noticed. Johnson & Johnson, for example, said it had resumed YouTube advertising in a number of countries. Google said other companies were starting to return. For the most part, Google failed to address the issue adequately before because it did not have to; the instances in which ads appeared next to objectionable content happened infrequently and out of view from the broader public. Google said for many of its top advertisers, the objectionable videos accounted for fewer than one one-thousandth of a percent of their total ad impressions. To train the computers, Google is applying machine-learning techniques — the underlying technology for many of its biggest breakthroughs, like the self-driving car.

The initiative, dubbed PAX for short (the word pax is Latin for “peace”), is free and open for anyone to join. Jamie Rosenberg, VP of Business & Operations at Android and Google Play, said in announcing PAX that members will grant each other royalty-free patent licenses covering “Android and Google Applications” on qualified devices. The idea, Rosenberg said, is to ensure that innovation and consumer choice – not patent threats – will continue to be key drivers of the Android ecosystem. Specifically, it’ll free up time and money for members (fighting off patent trolls is expensive and time-consuming, after all) who can then dedicate said resources to creating new ideas and products. A number of major Android players including Samsung, LG, Foxconn, HTC, HMD Global and of course, Google, have already signed up. Collectively, Rosenberg said members own more than 230,000 patents – a figure that’ll only grow as more companies join on. Other high-profile patent initiatives that Google has helped create include the License on Transfer (LOT) Network and the Open Patent Non-Assertion (OPN) Pledge. Those interested in joining are encouraged to visit the PAX website for more information.

File Photo: AP   | Photo Credit: AP Akanksha Jain New Delhi April 05, 2017 01:04 IST Updated: April 05, 2017 09:12 IST more-in Upholds arbitrator’s award directing man to transfer his domain name to Google on grounds of imitation The Delhi High Court has upheld an arbitrator’s award directing a man who got his domain name registered as ‘Googlee’ to transfer the same to Google Inc. on the grounds that the name of the homepage was a “slavish” imitation of the most widely used search engine. “Is a ‘googlee’ a wrong one? A cricket enthusiast will say, “Yes of course”. In the virtual world, too, the answer is well, yes..., remarked Justice S. Muralidhar, taking a cue from the cricketing term ‘googly’, which is pronounced as ‘goo-glee’. The court said so while deciding the petition of one Gulshan Khatri against an award passed by an arbitrator on May 6, 2011. In 2007, Mr. Khatri had applied to .IN Registry for registering a domain name, ‘Googlee.in’. The registration was granted and renewed in 2008 for four years. In 2010, it was renewed for another eight years. Notices sent In September 2010, Google Inc., US, sent Mr. Khatri a cease and desist notice, pointing out that he had not only copied its well-known mark but had also adopted a nearly-identical writing style, font, colour scheme, and layout. When another legal notice failed to elicit a response, Google filed a complaint against him under the .In Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy. The arbitrator then examined the complaint and after finding the domain name ‘Googlee.in’ “confusingly similar” to Google’s mark, directed that the infringing domain name be transferred to Google. In his petition before the high court, Mr. Khatri, who claimed to be the sole proprietor of M/s TCI Web Gate, said ‘Googlee.in’ was not similar to ‘Google’. The court, however, dismissed the claim. “The domain name and mark ‘Google’ is a coined word, distinctive in nature, particularly in relation to the goods and services that it represents. The adoption by Mr. Khatri of a nearly identical domain name, ‘Googlee.in’, is indeed in bad faith and not merely a coincidence. A glance at his web page shows how slavish his imitation is of Google’s writing style, font, colour scheme and layout.” “Mr. Khatri claims to have put in ‘a lot of research, intellectual capabilities, hard work, resources, lifetime savings and effort to prepare the content of the search engine’. What he does not explain is on what basis he adopted a domain name by simply adding the letter ‘e’ to the well-known domain name ‘Google’,” the court further said. Popular word Justice Muralidhar also highlighted how popular the word ‘google’ was. “..The word ‘google’ has metamorphosed into a verb in the English language. You no longer search for something on the Internet. You ‘google’ it,” he said. “Mr. Khatri was rightly stopped in his tracks by the arbitrator, who declared him out. He stands bowled by his own ‘googlee’,” the high court added.

Courtesy Google Lost in translation? Google says Arabic language service has improved Thamer Al Subaihi Follow @ThamerAlSubaihi April 4, 2017 Updated: April 4, 2017 11:19 PM Related Arabic translator app is a winner at Abu Dhabi international hackathon Pure nonsense ensues as Bing retweets get lost in translation ABU DHABI // Translation between Arabic and English is difficult enough – but anyone who has tried to use automated translation realises that this is even more problematic. So Google’s announcement on Monday that it has greatly improved its Arabic translation will come as a relief to many. Thousands of Arabic speakers and millions of their phrases have been used in new technology that is capable of translating whole sentences, rather than interpreting text piece by piece and learning over time from the input. Google’s "neural machine" translation system creates more natural translations, leading to increased fluency and accuracy. Since last November, the US technology giant has launched its new system for 15 other languages. The previous translation system, used for the first decade of Google Translate, relied on phrase-based technology. The old and new systems rely on massive amounts of translation information, but the main difference is in how they apply that data, said Najeeb Jarrar, Google’s product marketing manager for the Middle East and North Africa. "Neural doesn’t really learn languages as such, but rather it teaches itself how to generate results that match the parallel translations we’ve given it to learn from," he said. Maya Mazloum, who teaches Arabic at the Eton Institute, said she has noticed a marked improvement in Google’s translation of an English article into Arabic. "When I first saw the translation I said ‘wow’," said Ms Mazloum, who has taught Arabic for nine years. "I felt that it didn’t need the usual amendments. The order of the words was better and the grammatical endings were matching the gender of the nouns." Although the new system will help her students, who regularly use Google Translate, translations still need guidance from native speakers who can check and amend them, she said. Despite its limitations – especially for colloquial Arabic – the technology is a welcome aid in the classroom, said Ms Mazloum. But Hani El Imam, owner of Smart Translation, a UAE company, and an Arabic-English translator for 12 years, said the new system has degraded the quality of what he described as an already unreliable service. Although the new system has improved the grammar, Mr El Imam said he was finding an increasing number of incorrect interpretations of certain words. "No matter how far you advance the technology, you will never be able to replace human translation, especially with a rich language such as Arabic," said Mr El Imam, who wrote his thesis for his master’s degree on the incorrect translation of metaphors in the Quran. He said translation problems arose from linguistic and cultural differences between languages that challenge even the best translators. "If the leading translators are still translating metaphors in the Quran incorrectly, are you telling me that Google will be able to translate them in the regular language?" Mr El Imam asked. "I doubt it." But Mr Jarrar said Google’s translation system was not designed to supplant the incredible nuances of professional translation. "This system can’t translate something sophisticated like a novel, with all its contextual and cultural subtleties," he said. "But we’ve heard some translators use it for a quick first pass that they can then refine." The more Google’s system is used and as it learns from suggestions from the Google Translate community, the technology would continue to improve, said Mr Jarrar. "This is only the beginning and we expect the quality of the translation to get better," he said. _____ Nuances vital to translation: The new version of Google Translate is an immense improvement of the previous one, translators say. English version of Arabic text before improvements: • Muashah art hair novelty, different forms of lyrical poetry in Arabic, among other things, in his commitment to certain rules in technology and its use vernacular language or Aloagamah in Khrjtah, then the strong Batsalh singing. After improvements: • Al-Muhash is an innovative poetic art, different from Arabic poetry in many ways, by its adherence to certain rules of technology, its use of Arabic or Arabic in its output, and its strong connection to singing. However, translators also say that interpreting a text requires an understanding of linguistic nuances beyond the scope of literal translation. Google Translate version of an excerpt from Khalil Gibran’s book Broken Wings: • I was 18 years old when love opened my eyes with its magical sight, and touched myself for the first time with his fiery fingers. Salma was the dignity of the first woman, who awakened my spirit to her good, and walked ahead of me to the heaven of the upper emotions where the days pass like dreams and the nights pass like weddings. Salma Karama is the one who taught me to worship beauty in its beauty, and she showed me the secrets of love by turning her back. She sang the first house of the poem of moral life. Human translation: • I was 18 years of age when love, with its magical rays, opened my eyes and, for the first time, touched my soul with fiery fingers. Salma Karamy was the first woman to awaken my spirit to beauty and to lead me into a paradise of heavenly emotions, where days gently go by like a dream and nights are alive with the delights of celebration. With her charm, Salma Karamy taught me to worship at the altar of beauty. Her affections showed me the secrets of love; and hers was the first song of eternal love I ever heard. tsubaihi@thenational.ae Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Technology Lost in translation?

Now, Google has published a list of everything that works with Home, and we expect this will grow over time. Here's what Google has published so far on its support site for Home.

Like in Amazon Echo we just have to say "Alexa". David Hyman Microsoft just recently changed the Xbox commands from Xbox to Cortona. Not only is it worse than before but I constantly say the old keyword. The thing with ok google is that it never really comes up during a normal conversation where as Siri and Alexa sound more like other names and leaves to false keyword activation XerBlade Having "Xbox" as the hotword was pretty much the dumbest idea they could've possibly had. Unless you are a lonely warrior who only plays video games by himself all the time (as game developers seem to think all gamers are these days since hardly anyone who isn't Nintendo builds local multiplayer anymore...), it is extremely likely that the word "Xbox" is going to come up in normal conversation extremely often while you are using the Xbox with your friends or family. In fact, I know from experience that it happens constantly. David Hyman True but my point was about the issues with changing hotwords, and the fact that Cortona is worse than what they had before Jarrett Lennon Kaufman In what way is it worse? "Hey Cortana" works pretty well for me on my computer and Xbox with NO false positives like before. trickinit It doesn't work very well for me. It's a lot slower to respond and it tends to get the command wrong a lot more than it used to with "Xbox". Anytime Cortana doesn't understand me, it switches to the browser to do a Bing search. That get pretty frustrating when I'm trying to record a game clip. David Hyman Yea! Try having Cortona try to find a TV show, that used to be solid with the old way and completely fails now Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That doesn't sound like a problem with the command, necessarily, but the software change overall. David Hyman It seems like it always has to phone home for even the simplest commands like turn off. It seems to fail to understand that command very often lzdking I keep switching back to Cortona after system updates because I really want to use it, but the lag time is too much. Very annoying to tell Cortona to pause a show and then have it take anywhere from 3 - 8 seconds to pause. I switched back to the Xbox commands because they are nearly instant. David Hyman Dude that's definitely a major issue. I keep using it so they get more data to hopefully improve it. I like the media capabilities of my Xbox more than Chromecast because I get hdmi pass through for my Comcast box and it has Amazon video. Two things that I can't get with a Chromecast XerBlade I wasn't going to correct you if you only said it once, but it's "Cortana." David Hyman Oh sorry auto correct Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That would be terrible. The word "Google" comes up a lot in conversation in 2016. No way I'd want that alone to be the keyword in my living room. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] It's 'Ok Google'. Do you really say those two words together outside of voice recognition interactions? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Did you bother to read the comment I was replying to? Damodara Kovie [dkovie] I feel a fool. My apologies, good sir. enoch861 At least those sound much much better than Ok, Google. catalysto Yes, "Alexa" is very easy to say and makes it feel like I'm talking to an actual person. "OK, Google" is awkward and alienating, at best. Matt Cortana is probably the best name actually. It's easy to say and is different enough that you shouldn't get a lot of false positives. I imagine Alexa could get annoying in households where someone is named Alexa, Alexis, possibly even Alex. wjrandon I'm tired of saying "ok google" as well. Marko Šaric Yeah. I wish that could be changed. At least "Hey Google!", as was shown at Google io. Lateef Alabi-Oki You can use "Hey Google" also. XerBlade At which point tech podcasters everywhere will have to find a new substitute phrase to use when they want to talk about it without activating the devices of everyone listening en masse. Lateef Alabi-Oki Hopefully, the voice training technology improves in these devices so that only registered voices can trigger the hotword. blassster And they need to tie the person's registered voice and query to the proper Google account. Custom hotwords per user would help. Lateef Alabi-Oki I believe Dieter Bohn said they were working on that in today's Verge podcast. If true, that'd be really neat. blassster I've never had this problem after they rolled out the training model part of the setup so long ago. XerBlade I never had that problem until they did that. Actually, they rolled out the training part of the setup alongside the "OK Google everywhere" feature. Neither existed before the other. So I highly doubt very many people had the issue BEFORE they rolled out the training model part of the setup, because they would literally have to be sitting either on the Google Now screen or (in the case of Nexus devices only at the time) on the home screen at the time when the hotword was heard, the chances of which are kinda low. blassster Oh, I thought the training model came later. I remember after training it (or, probably re-training it if you are correct) that it was solved. Early on for me it was the worst! youareme7 really? that's a Home thing I missed? I mean I want custom but at least hey google rolls off a little easier than ok google. Lateef Alabi-Oki I doubt they'd make it customizable since "Ok, Google" is free marketing and brand awareness for them. youareme7 Yeah, don't disagree but still a bummer, that syllable salad is a minor annoyance Lateef Alabi-Oki Yeah, I can see how it may be difficult to pronounce for non-English speakers. Maison Pulaski I doubt they would change the name of their flagship phone because _Nexus_ is free.... Oh wait.... Nevermind. Lateef Alabi-Oki You're right. This is Google we're talking about. We might wake up tomorrow and the hotword would be "Hey, Giri". By the way they're going to change the name of the Google Cast app to Google Home. Not confusing at all. Arthur J. hey google doesn't work Tuck Choate You don't have a Google home to test it on, yet, do you? Arthur J. I was speaking about Nexus Tuck Choate This discussion is about Google home. Arthur J. yeah, but why the command would be this on a device and that on another Tuck Choate It's primarily a voice device. AP even did an article on an APK breakdown on how they might give more control to users for voice actions. http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/19/google-app-v6-3-suggests-google-assistant-may-launch-limited-language-support-expands-user-defined-actions-apk-teardown/ Arthur J. Forgot that one, that would so nice if they expand it to all devices. As Youareme7 said, 'OK' an extra syllable and "hey" would be more discreet. Especially when you say in English US in a non english country Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Yes, but more syllables was purposeful. More syllables makes it easier for the software to understand and gives you fewer false positives. Ryan Hey google works, I have one. Its not as reliable as OK google though. Lateef Alabi-Oki I believe "Hey, Google" worked in the demos. I may be wrong though, but I thought it did. Arthur J. I didn't payed attention to that Matt It just worked on my phone. 6p YaKillaCJ Just worked on my watch too. Hey Google is a lot more natural than ok Google. Still should be able to name your device. It's only natural since U can nickname/hotkey people. That way my Phone, Remote (older phone), Tablet, Watch, and now Home doesn't go off at once. drksilenc It does work i use it at home all the time. It doesnt work from cell phone which is done on purpose so you dont get multiple google devices activating at the same time. Justin W Hey Google works for me with my phone. Not sure if it's me just not saying it clearly enough or if it's actually a supported hotword though. Marko Šaric Works for me too (just tried it out). On my g watch and Nexus 5x. Cool. Markus Ressel Still kind of awkward imo dhamp2g Pretty silly reason to me, but to each his own. Marko Šaric Will Google Home work in Europe? (By Europe I mean Croatia). Lateef Alabi-Oki No, because the EU will find an excuse to sanction them for another monopoly abuse claim. Marko Šaric Seriously though. I was thinking about getting one. But I would like to know if I could actually use the thing and not just admire it. Lateef Alabi-Oki I think it's US only for now. It might come to Europe next year. They probably want to get multilingual issues sorted out first before they introduce it in Europe. Marko Šaric That's a bit disappointing if true. I would use it in English anyway. Lars Jeppesen Of course it will work if you import it. I'm planning to.. Marko Šaric I'm planning to also. However, I would like to not pay 3 times the price after shipping and taxes. Any tips for import sites where you may have purchased items previously. I've never imported from the states, as I merely use Amazon.de or UK. Lars Jeppesen Why would you think that? You think it checks your location and refuses to work if outside the US? Lateef Alabi-Oki Nope. I'm just speculating. I could competely wrong. Gregory It might not be sold in Europe, but will it work in Europe? I also don't mind using it in English. Matt I want to know this too. I might get my US friend to bring one with him in December to the UK, if it's going to work that is. Lateef Alabi-Oki If Google Assistant works in Europe, and I believe it does, I see no reason why Google Home wouldn't. I doubt Google would deliberately region lock Home. Jens Törnblad It doesn't work with Android TV? RedPandaAlex I'm pretty sure they confirmed that it will worth with Android TV using the Google Cast feature. Lateef Alabi-Oki It works with any Google Cast enabled device, including Android TV. Christofftofferson I assumed it would as android tv is a Chromecast receiver. komal You have a nice post and i liked very much http://www.printablecalendar2017.us/2016/07/march-2017-calendar.html XerBlade It will cast to an Android TV device, yes, but you can't use it (yet) to control the Android TV interface with voice commands like you can with one of the Android TV voice remotes. So it's kinda halfway supported. 2×4 Missing: - 8tracks? - TP-Link Kasa? - Ecobee? Lazy Tango All my standing lights are connected through TP-Link Kasa... Partially because Alexa connects to it, but mostly because I can't afford Hue lights. 2×4 in my case, I use Kasa because solutions that require a hub haven't worked reliably enough for me. CUEBALL Same here. Hope Kasa integrates with Home in the near future. Kevin Sauer No Ecobee? No Caseta Wireless Lutron? The smarthome space is so annoying right now. "Buy this thing! It may work with some other stuff. I dunno. Good luck." wjrandon "Ok Google, start the Rooma"? Kevin Sauer Sure that sounds good Philip Worthington Maybe, although I suspect what you got would be closer to this... https://youtu.be/g8v6cZ21vlc thomasguide2 Shouldn't the roomba be starting by itself? Phoenix I see what you did there Fatty Bunter You can do this with a Harmony Hub and IFTTT right now by issuing the appropriate IR command for a given voice keyword. Obviously that requires more $, but hey it's possible. enoch861 This is why you just buy the Echo. It works with mostly everything. catalysto Yeah, except the Amazon ecosystem is nowhere near as robust as Google's (e.g., Calendar, Maps, et cetera). Amazon has the upper hand on hardware integration at the moment, but I have no doubt that Google will quickly catch up -- especially with this fairly impressive launch list (remember Echo launched with none). Matt Maps "Ok Google, Navigate to the store." "You're in your house dumbfuck, but here's a map to the store on your TV." catalysto So... What exactly is your point? You know Alexa doesn't have this information, right? Cory S it actually can do all those things. Albeit badly, but it does. cabbieBot best comment on AP possibly ever. Brandon V. Fletcher Echo's support grew over time. So will Google Home's. Hector Diaz I have 3 echo so with Smartthings. Really like it but echo is not that smart. shadowdude777 It really bugs me that Play Music doesn't work with the Echo. And this is ALL GOOGLE'S FAULT. If they would just expose an API like Spotify does, we could have support for Play Music everywhere that we have Spotify. I'd ditch Play Music today, because Spotify has a better desktop client, better social features, an app that isn't a lagfest, and better family pricing now, but I'd lose out on Play Music's ability to upload my own tracks, which is sadly quite important to me. :( Cory S Amazon blocks Chromecast products from even being sold on their store, and you think they would work well with Google on this? BRB I need to get back to watch Prime video on my TV....oh wait its Android TV and I cant because actively AMAZON BLOCKS IT. shadowdude777 Amazon doesn't have to do ANYTHING if Google didn't provide such a bad service with a locked-down API; that's the point. If there were a Play Music API, a third-party dev could write the Echo Skill that integrates with it, with no work on Amazon's part. All of these walled gardens are infuriating; Google needs to learn to play nice with other ecosystems. It would solve a lot of their problems if they just made it possible to integrate their services with other systems. Andy J Did you really just suggest that Google doesn't open up everything they can for developers? You have seen https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/ right? shadowdude777 You're joking, right? Are you really defending them and saying that "they're doing the best they can"? If they were opening up everything they can for developers, why is there no music API? Spotify has one. Why is there no Hangouts API? Why is there no Allo API? These are all services that NEED APIs to be taken seriously. Give me one good reason why they can't expose an API for these services. Andy J OK - well..... Hangouts & Allo = proprietary, just like WhatsApp doesn't have an API, Facebook messenger doesn't have an API. The music service doesn't have an API for any number of reasons ranging from - they don't want to expose the service via an API to - the contracts they have agreed with the studios and labels may well disallow it, don't make the mistake that all the music services have identical agreements with the labels because that is far from the case. Finally - don't fall in to the trap that every service under the sun should/does have an API - Netflix doesn't provide an API allowing you to consume their paid for content outside of the Netflix ecosystem. Amazon TV doesn't have an API allowing you to consume their video content outside of their service. shadowdude777 Google Talk used standards (XMPP) while Hangouts doesn't, and Allo doesn't. Yes, other walled gardens also don't provide APIs, but you shouldn't pretend that Google is some bastion of developer/consumer-friendliness when they're just as bad as every other company that thinks they're above playing nice with others. Slack has an API, Discord has an API, Telegram has an API etc. There's no way that Google was able to negotiate an agreement allowing for a feature like users uploading their own songs to Play Music, but not negotiate an agreement allowing for API access for premium members like Spotify has. This is a decision they made, considering they obviously have the pull to make an API happen if they actually cared. Yes, video streaming services don't provide APIs, and I'm not asking for Google to open up a Play Movies streaming API. But Play Music has no reason not to have one, nor do Google's multiple failing messenger apps. Andy J "Yes, video streaming services don't provide APIs, and I'm not asking for Google to open up a Play Movies streaming API." This is my point - why? Why aren't you asking for that? Your entire argument is that Google don't have enough APIs - why stop at demanding Play Music? I'm not saying Google should not open up an Play Music API - there is obviously something because there are unofficial apps that use an undocumented API - but why do you think it would be OK to not open up a video streaming API too - after all - YouTube has one, why shouldn't Play Movies - especially considering it uses YouTube on the backend anyway. Josh Hoffman How is the Spotify family pricing better than Google All Access? Play music 6 users for 14.99 plus Youtube Red. Spotify is 14.99 for 6 users but spotify only. shadowdude777 Didn't realize it was you + 5 people for Play Music, I thought it was 5 people total (so you + 4 people). Yeah, I guess GPM's pricing is better. Pranav Check IFTTT, they have a lot of connections that solve this issue Savage Alien Ecobee commands are HomeKit based. atlharry Not just HomeKit. Smartthings works as well so you could get to the Ecobee through Smartthings. Savage Alien Oh, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. youareme7 These are just the launch (pre-launch?) partners, it'll expand exponentially when they open it up in December. I use Wink for instance and I know they're working on it but weren't a "launch partner". dhamp2g They have some big ones on the list. It works with chrome cast, text , and Play music.....I'm in Lars Jeppesen Never heard of those products.... Ryan IFTTT gives you control over all of that. The setup kind of sucks, Ill admit, but the plus side you can customize the phrases that trigger things to something that is more "human" or fun. Kevin Sauer Thanks for your reply. I have already done all of that through IFTTT, but as you point out, it's a pain in the ass. I would prefer the manufacturers bake it into their product directly. YaKillaCJ @Ryan I did the same here. I just setup a lot using IFTTT, Pushbullet & Tasker. Sure U have to manually make the word commands but it works. Nothing like saying "Hey Google" and control nearly everything. Ryan Yeah, its definitely tedious. But odds are I will keep doing it after makers like Wemo and Lutron plug in because, what I have seen so far with 3rd party services, their actions are really limited. While I had to set it up its nice to be able to say "Hey Google, start a fire" to have it turn on my fireplace instead of something more literal. BAlGaInTl I paired mine with a Samsung SmartThings hub that was on sale for $50. I can control my Ecobee seamlessly through that. I don't think there is Lutron support yet though. MicroNix This is why Echo > Google Home right now and probably for some time. Android sites are hyping Google Home like its some great thing. It barely works with anything in a smart home right now. Let's revisit in a year or so. Until then, umm, no thanks. Gregg Long I hope Caseta comes through soon. A much better solution for lights that aren't table lamps. Gregg Long Yes much better - and they still offer a wall wart plug in for table lamps. And unlike solutions like Hue, you can use a caseta wall switch which works with regular decora plates to turn on and off the lights while still having retaining control through your app. With Wifi lights, when you turn them off at the switch your remote control turns off with them. eazyean1 Sonos? Lateef Alabi-Oki If you can connect the Audio Chromecast to Sonos, it might be able to work. I don't have a Sonos, but I heard someone talk about it on an IOT podcast yesterday. Christofftofferson Most of the sonos speakers don't have audio in jacks (only the play 5 does). Sonos does accept google cast from Google play if you have sonos on the android phone you're casting from. Also they annouced they're working with Alexa to get voice control in 2017... so hopefully they remain fairly agnostic between Google, Amazon and others. Lateef Alabi-Oki Honestly, I see no reason why Sonos can't write some actions for Google Assistant and Google Home. They'd be foolish not to, since it looks like Google wants Assistant and Home to be an open platform for developers. op12 They're definitely thinking about it, but who knows how long it'll be considering the Amazon Alexa integration took months... https://twitter.com/JohnLMacFarlane/status/733013734625415168 Benoit Bourdua Plex seems like something people would want to see there. Corbin Davenport If it had Plex support, at least for audio, I would buy one. Benoit Bourdua I play my music using Plex on Synology + Chromecast Audio. Not sure I'll buy one, but if there is no support for that combo it's a sure thing I won't. MicroNix Synology, what a great NAS. Worth every penny. Blake Mitchell I'm starting to regret getting a QNAP. komal You have a nice thought and very creative and awesome http://www.printablecalendar2017.us/2016/07/february-2017-calendar.html Soundjudgment Plex just finished its app update-release for iOS and iPhone/iPad. Google Home should be next. Morten Ulv Not before December when Actions on Google comes. Mike Marshall Senior director of Yahoo!, is telling visitors to start off "Work at home" practice, that People have been doing for more than a year now. This season only, I generated about $36k already with nothing but my laptop or computer as well as some leisure time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to five job.

This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Y3 Fatty Bunter WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW? TELL ME IMMEDIATELY. But seriously, this would be by far the biggest jump in capability for me and many others I know. Would love this so much, cant wait. Aaron Geier You can cast to the Google Home from the Plex app in Android. Chris McGrath they just released alexa support, i imagine google home isn't far behind it Mark555055 i would be shocked if Plex did not interface with Google home in the near future.

Will it work? Even with an iPhone? Boolean Corporation Netflix or bust Angst They (At the event on October 4th) said that Netflix was already on-board with making integration in the 'very near' future JSo So anything that works with the Chromecast should work with the Nexus Player, right? João Dias So does this mean that Google keep is getting an api? :D Andrew Gallagher Any idea how it will work in a multiple Google account household? Andy J Yup....... until they implement something - you know - sensible.... currently you have to find out who is logged in, find them, ask them to log out (using their phone), log in and perform whatever it was you wanted to do (which you could of done 10 times over with just your phone by the time you get logged in to it). I wish they had resolved this issue BEFORE selling it.... scasmflop Video list seems a bit light... I would guess that Google Play Movies should be in there as well. I thought I remembered them calling up "Stranger Things" during the on stage demo to insinuate netflix also working in some capacity. Thomas Paulsen After the I/O event I was expecting that we would see some cunning home automation examples. Google is full of engineers that like to cook-up some awesome things. But we didn't see that. The only native home automation partner appears to be Nest. No word on the level of integration. Say an object moves into the Nest camera view. Let me see a live stream on my Android TV. Instead we are getting SmartThings support. SM had horrible latency at one point. So not only does my command have to go through Google but also through SM and back. Not to mention SM security concerns. No word on Brillo and Weave standards. Very concerning. I'd by a Google Home supported door lock right away. Smart door locks have been a disappointment so far actually. Defenestratus Smart things no longer has horrible latency. surethom Hopefully by the time Google Home comes to the UK next Summer or later, I hope Wemo & lifx are supported, & also able to select Hot word, even Hey Google is better than Ok Google. trent Why no voice calls over hangouts. Seems like a perfect use case. Oh right ... Hangouts is now a class B deprecated product! sasidhar79 any chance of Google Assistant becoming available for devices other than Pixel? Lars Jeppesen Allo MrCalifornia I wonder if there will be two user support. Would be awesome if it could recognize the difference between my wife and I and let us use different calendars, etc. steelew Whose user account does it use? In a house with 4 people, separation is a must. They haven't made any mention of it, so I'm guessing it's just one account. Andy J yup (at a time). Andy J I hope to see Logitech Media Center on here - it already supports Chromecasts so I expect they will do something..... Defenestratus I use a harmony hub through smartThings which is integrated with Home so I can control my heat pumps. Greg DePasse I (and 100's of others - https://goo.gl/KVWzkI) would like to know if Google Home (and Assistant for that matter) will work with GSuite accounts (the new Google Apps for Domain/Work etc). Assistant currently access personal details in Allo for instance, so it's not promising for those of us that pay for GSuite accounts for our families. mcdonsco Hopefully Google doesn't pull an Amazon and exclude ecobee because of nest; so far it looks that way :-/ Dn Bro I think you could try using ifttt Đức Thành Would love to see some good podcast apps on that list. TuneIn is "Meh". Beast TuneIn is great for internet radio, I use it all the time :) Đức Thành I used to use TuneIn frequently, but then Pocket Casts happened. It's not perfect but it offers a significantly better experience. You should give it a try. Defenestratus Google Play Music does podcasts. Đức Thành I'm aware, but it does not in my country. xanok No Ecobee? doom Alexa can turn the temperature up or down on a Nest but can't turn the heat or cool on if it is set to off. If Google Home can do that, I'll switch right away. Beast I expect since Google bought Nest they will have full app integration as part of Google Home :) Emanuele Ricci I would really love to see an integration with Netatmo.

I have a TP-Link, which works fine with their app, but I've been holding off on buying anything more until I know it's compatible with Google Home. Having to unlock my phone, open the app, and then change the lights is too many steps for me to do with a smart device like lights. dhamp2g People are All these services with with very small followings when compared to google Eco system many of which who have never heard of in the general from non tech community this is aimed at the general population bill875 Support for Insteon would be nice. I have SmartThings as well for my Schlage locks, but Insteon controls some of the lighting in my house. DongoDongo Not trying to be negative but, can someone remind me why you need to "aumotate" your home, especially by voice? I can probably toggle the switch more than 10 times before you're done with a voice command. Adam Margeson Are you asking about reality, or what they're trying to sell me? They're selling me the ability to turn on/off the lights from the couch without having to get up. Not having to get up is not worth my health or however much they want for this and a couple of "smart lights". Beast Or in fact the total home automation, i.e. when you leave the house the lights turn off, when you come back they turn on, music can start to play when you come home, etc, etc. It isn't about convenience, it is about a new technological era.... :) Marko Šaric Is this an intentional oversimplification? Adam Margeson A little bit. I use Tasker to do all sorts of little automations of settings or interactions on my phone. But I'm not the average person - I like taking time to tweak and program things to make future interaction easier for myself. Most people aren't that enthusiastic about programming automation or will get frustrated with setting up rules that fit most situations properly. Example: "Arm my alarm system when I leave the house" -> the wife is still home when you walk out, the system still arms itself. "Do what I mean, not what I say," is something that comes to mind for how users want automation to work. When computer AI and sensing technology get to a much better state, we might be able to do that, but right now, proper automation takes a *lot* of patience to set up. Marko Šaric Fair enough. Defenestratus Because I can turn lights on and off without leaving my chair. For example, I Just told my Google Home "Hey Google turn on the christmas tree" and voila, its on. Its equally as useful when you want to turn on a whole room full of lights at the same time. in my Kitchen I have four different light switches that I'd need to tap in order to turn on all the lights. Instead I just say "Ok Google turn on all the kitchen lights" and bam. On. Likewise its great for dimming them. "Hey google dim the kitchen lights to 25%" Letting the dog out the back door, I go "OK google, turn on all the outside lights" turns on all of the fixtures outside. Now that I've lived with it for a few months, I don't know how I lived without it. (I have all of my switches linked through SmartThings) Leonardo Baez You don't "need" Its an option. Think of that disabled people who can switch lights, set temperature o turn on a tv just with their voice Tucker Sferro how convenient for Google that my Nexus 6 Google now voice activation from any screen is no longer available!! it visibly toggles itself off in settings, and other Nexus 6 owners have had the same issue for quite some time now. Beast Would be nice to get Hive integration, proper Cast to Sonos would be the selling point for me. Angus Marshall Your list is out of date already... Gerardo Sarabia Now if only they unified Assistant on Home and the Pixel... not gonna happen. Gotta keep things as inconsistent as possible, because Google. ChilZeg what kind of unification are you thinking??? Gerardo Sarabia Having the option of controlling other devices (chromecast, chromecast audio or chromecast built-in devices, for example) with Assistant on Pixel. Stenso Has anyone figured out how to use Reminders? "Okay Google, remind me to take the dog out?" "Okay, when would you like to be reminded? Say a place or time." "When I arrive home." "Your reminder has been set." Jon Fridman You can't use reminders via Google Home yet. I'm sure it's being worked on for a future release, or at least I hope so. Stenso This really disappointed me. I just kind of assumed this would work since it has Keep and Calendar hooks. It was a big reason I jumped ship from Echo. Fingers crossed it makes it in soon. Jon Fridman Due to an NDA I can't really comment on what Google is planning for the home in that regard. I have high hopes for my Google home and it's future abilities. BierKerl Doesn't your dog remind you to take it out quite aggressively when you get home? ;-) Leonardo Baez Lol 😂 Alec M Mine has serious issues streaming Netflix on my Asus Nexus Player. Has anyone else had the same experience with maybe a Roku or something similar? madmaglio Works fine with my gen 1 chromecast. The Home just start the stream. It's the device that would be having the issue. Alec M Yeah, I have some friends that have the small chromecasts and they work fine. I have a feeling that the issue is having a device that has Netflix as a standalone app installed. Bill Anderson Shouldn't Android TV be on this list? I know it's kind of covered by Chromecast, but then it wasn't supported until a day ago. Garrett Penfield Mine STILL doesn't work with Spotify... mrlex You spelt Philips wrong (only one l) YaKillaCJ Enabling IFTTT was a big 1. Thru this I am able to use Google Home to control Hook Automation which controls any RF device. It's making me spoiled. Vladimir Only Murica. Right? Any rumors when should it come overseas? Adam Carl Aren't you forgetting Uber? I can link my Uber account to my home Abhinav You can ask question on Quora too. JG Is there a way to get it to prefer one service over another? I haven't linked Netflix to the account the Home in the living room is connected to. Yet when I asked it to play "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" it only looks on Netflix for it. It use to have no problem pulling the album from Google Play Music (which is linked to the account). [The album BTW is basically an audio book if you don't have any video casting devices online] I got it to work after specifying GPM, but that's a bit of a mouth full. And since there is me Netflix account linked to it... Shouldn't it attempt to use an it has access to first? madmaglio I think if you say "listen to..." i think it will assume its music and not the film and use Play Music. Gregg Long There is a serious bug going on with Nest Thermostats. The Google Home can't find it - keeps saying it's unavailable. Even though Google Now can control it fine when you are out of the house. shayden Google home + Smartthings + Harmony Hub + IFTT for custom commands is all the home control I could ever want. I have an HDMI matrix and 4 TVs. I can just say "ok google set the secondary TV to Xbox" or "ok google set the sound to chromecast". And of course I can control all the lighting with my voice. And the one thing for me that puts google home far above the echo is my ability to play whole home audio with google home and chromecast audios. "ok google play my favorite music on first floor". Boom, done. PerhapsNever Ooooohhhh!!! How are you doing the input commands? I've been DYING to figure out how to expose actual Harmony controls to my GH. My setup is 3 Harmony Hubs, ST, Hue lights, and IFTTT. shayden You use IFTTT to bridge the home and the hub. The catch is whatever command you are trying to accomplish with the harmony hub has to be an activity. so I have made a ton of different activities just to do simple things like switch inputs or adjust volume. You setup IFTTT using google assistant as the "if". You can choose whatever activation command you want and can also put in different ways of saying it as well as a custom response back from the google home. you make the "then" the harmony activity that you want to run once the custom command is heard. PerhapsNever Ahhhh, gotcha. I only have about 5 activities on each of my hubs, but I never thought about making activities for a single action. GENIUS! Thanks for the reply! shayden I recommend using the desktop app vs the phone app when setting up all the activities. much easier and quicker to work with a mouse and keyboard. NoConcussion The Google Home app has been updated to include more than 50 "service" apps. Too many to list and probably memorize. Apps like games, psychotherapist, search capability, local events, social media, language training, news trends, pizza ordering, personal trainer and more. abc I'll check out Home in a few years. Let the fanboys do the full-retail price beta testing. dhamp2g Love to. Vandale Gentry You can order Domino's pizza from the Google Home! PorchSong BTW, it's "Continually" updated, not "continuously." But thank you for maintaining this list. Emanuele Ricci Still waiting for Netatmo :'( Abdulgader Badkook You forgot to mention akinator. It is available by saying "let me speak to akinator" Shahul Hameed Akbar Why isn't Shield not listed in streaming devices? I am able to cast music and YT videos from Google Home to it since December. Kevin Brosseau So the New Shield is not supported yet with casting Netflix to the box? Ruperto17 Netflix does not work with Google TV, only Chromecast at the moment. Google Home will tell me if I try to send anything to my Nexus Player. pookietookie Google Home can set calendar reminders now? dcdttu Do the Honeywell thermostats require SmartThings? (As in, are they Z-Wave?) If so, should they be a subset of SmartThings? If not, nvrmnd. Artem Russakovskii No, they're just Wi-Fi, like Nest. dcdttu Well that makes sense then. :-) Now I'm just waiting patiently for Wink to get the green light. Roy So am I missing something or is Android TV seriously not supported? Kostas 💪🎩 It's Bang & Olufsen James Ogle You've added Belkin Wemo, but it doesn't support their lightbulbs. Only their switches and power outlets. I've tried it, it doesn't recognise the Wemo Link hub or anything connected to it. bigwill_420 I see they didn't bother putting nvidia shield tv on the list. 😢 Leonardo Baez How do I use the services? mustbepbs Still can't add time to an existing timer. keithzg Remains only available in the US and UK. Dammit, Google, Canada is right here, on the same continent, and if you were worried about the spelling of "colour" on the packaging or something then you've already handled that with the UK, so what's the delay? iantrich You're missing quite a few services and iHeartRadio is already integrated Anthony Chandler Any word on Sonos integration? I get that they're competitors w/ Chromecast Audio, but I've heard that Sonos is looking for tighter integration with popular services...

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now Defense lawyers in the John Wiley Price public corruption trial will have a chance to requestion two key government witnesses using evidence prosecutors had failed to share with them, a federal judge ruled late Tuesday.  But what the defense team really wanted was a mistrial or for U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn to throw out testimony from the witnesses — a former lead FBI agent on the case and an FBI forensic accountant.  Lynn denied those motions. Prosecutors are required to give the defense all evidence relating to their witnesses before they testify so the defense can be fully prepared to question them during cross-examination. That didn't happen in the case of retired FBI agent Don Sherman and FBI accountant David Garcia, who both testified early in the trial. When Lynn learned Tuesday about the prosecution's mistake, she sent the jurors home around noon to give the government time to provide the defense lawyers with emails and other documents related to Sherman and Garcia.  Marlo Cadeddu, a lawyer for Dapheny Fain, Price's chief of staff and his co-defendant in the case, requested the mistrial. Another remedy she and Price attorney Shirley Baccus-Lobel sought was for Lynn to strike the testimony of Sherman and Garcia.  But Lynn called that "excessive" and said she would instead allow the defense attorneys to ask Sherman and Garcia additional questions on Wednesday after reading the new evidence that prosecutors provided. Lynn said prosecutors cannot have any contact with the two FBI  witnesses prior to them returning to the witness stand. She said she also won't allow prosecutors to ask the witnesses additional questions after the defense has finished with them, unless they convince her otherwise. Fain is charged with lying to the FBI in 2011 after she denied that Price benefited financially from her business, MMS Co., which sold promotional items like key chains and items needed in offices like TV monitors.  One of the documents prosecutors turned over to Fain's attorneys late Tuesday is a rough draft of notes FBI Agent Allen Wilson took when he and another agent questioned Fain about Price's involvement in her business. Wilson, the lead case agent, testified for the government on Tuesday morning about how the Price investigation began. He was the government's final witness. Wilson has not yet been cross-examined. Lynn made no attempt to hide her irritation at government prosecutors for the delay in producing evidence.  It was the second day in a row that prosecutors disclosed they had found additional evidence that wasn't shared with the defense. "This happened on the government's watch," Lynn said. "The record will reflect that the judge is showing signs of angst." Building a case During his testimony, Wilson told jurors that he used Google Street View as well as some old-fashioned surveillance techniques to launch the bribery, mail fraud and tax evasion investigation into Price in May 2010. He said a key factor was when the FBI learned that Price's 2008 personal financial statement filed with Dallas County did not include income Price had received from Kathy Nealy, his political consultant who also lobbied for companies seeking county business. Wilson said he and Sherman, his partner in the Price corruption case, also discovered that Price was getting money from Karen Manning, an art gallery owner, and from Fain's business. In April 2010, Wilson and Sherman drove by Price's Oak Cliff home and noticed a Chevrolet Avalanche in the driveway, he said. They ran the tag and it came back in Nealy's name, Wilson said. At the time, they thought Nealy was visiting Price, he said. On May 11, 2010, Wilson and Sherman entered Price's home address into Google Street View, which gave them photographs of the house. It showed the same Avalanche, he said, as well as an Aston Martin. That told them the Avalanche had been there since 2007 — when Price traded in the Aston Martin for a Bentley, he said. Wilson said surveillance was done on Price to learn his "day-to-day activities" and find out with whom he was associating. Kathy Nealy The cameras affixed to utility poles in front of and next to Price's house from May 2010 to July 2011 also allowed agents to observe his use of vehicles, Wilson said. The camera footage showed that Price was using a new 2010 Avalanche, also registered to Nealy, about 90 percent of the time, Wilson said. Agents also saw Price driving a 2005 BMW registered to Nealy, Wilson said. When a Price fundraiser was held in April 2011 at Manning's Millennium 2000 art gallery at the South Side on Lamar complex, agents were taking photos of people and vehicles coming and going, Wilson said. At some point, agents learned that AT&T was a large customer of Fain's MMS business from 2005 to 2008, Wilson said.  Price earned income from MMS during that time, Wilson said, and AT&T had a contract with Dallas County to provide inmate phone service. On retainer In June 2011, agents searched the homes and offices of the defendants. And Wilson and Sherman met with Fain in the Commissioners Court meeting room to ask her questions. Fain initially said Price had no role in the business of MMS, said Wilson. At the time, Wilson and Sherman had seen bank records showing that Price gave money to MMS 49 times from February 2005 to June 2011, Wilson said, for a total of $500,492. When asked about that, Fain denied that money was transferred from Price to MMS accounts, Wilson said. And Fain never said anything about a loan during the questioning, he said. "That would have been important information for us to know," Wilson said. Fain's defense has argued that payments to Price were for loans he gave her. Prosecutors say Price got more money out of MMS than he put into the business. Wilson said Fain was "cordial" and agreeable at the start of the interview, although she tried to change the subject when asked about Price's connection to MMS. When Sherman asked her about specific transactions between Price and MMS, Nealy became "agitated" and "decided to end the interview," Wilson said. She also accused the agents of trying to "twist" her words and "trick" her, he said. Sherman's stroke in the summer of 2012 "dramatically changed the course of the investigation," Wilson said. He said he assumed the lead agent role while other agents were brought in to help. Wilson told the jury that Nealy had Price on a "type of retainer" to provide her with help in getting county contracts and other approvals for her clients. The multiple payments from Nealy to Price over time were a "one-way street," he said, adding that the two had an "exclusive relationship." Also Tuesday, Price's attorney told Lynn she intends to call Nealy as a defense witness. Nealy's attorney said her client will invoke her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.

The registration was granted, and renewed in 2008 for four years. It was later renewed for another eight years, till 2020. In September 2010, Google sent him a cease and desist notice. It claimed that he had not only copied its well-known mark Google, but also adopted a nearly identical writing style, font, colour scheme, and layout. When a further legal notice failed to elicit a response, Google filed a complaint against him under the .In Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (INDRP). On May 6, 2011, an arbitrator appointed by the National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) ruled in favour of Google. Confusingly similar On examining the complaint made by Google Inc. against the petitioner, it had found the domain name ‘googlee.in’ to be confusingly similar to Google’s mark. Not ready to give up, Mr. Khatri took the matter to court. In his petition before the Delhi High Court, Mr. Khatri said Google protested too much about the letter ‘e’ being added to its domain name, and asserted that ‘googlee.in’ is not confusingly similar to ‘google’. So, is a ‘googlee’ a wrong one? A cricket enthusiast might say, “Yes, of course”. In the virtual world too, the answer is well, yes..., said Justice S.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 48 Plus 1 on G+ 186 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure.

Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 4, 2017 at 2:28PM Virtual reality (VR) may be off to a slow start with consumers, but investors only need to scratch beneath the surface to see how many technology companies are already pushing ahead on VR.    The combined augmented reality and virtual reality market is expected to be worth $13.9 billion this year -- but in just three years, it's forecast to grow by an order of magnitude reaching $143.3 billion in 2020, according to IDC. And while much of the focus is on headsets and controllers right now, it's likely to be software makers and platform creators that benefit the most.  Image source: Oculus. "AR and VR headsets get most of the media attention right now, but the hardware is only as good as the software and services running on it," Tom Mainelli, IDC's program vice president for devices and AR/VR, said recently. That's why investors would be wise to consider Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for their VR potential. Forget that these are among the biggest players in the broader tech space for a moment, and focus instead that they are pursuing VR from a different angle than most of their competitors.  Why Alphabet is a top virtual reality stock Ignore Google Cardboard. You can even set aside Google's latest headset, Daydream View, if you'd like. Instead, think about hundreds of millions of smartphone users going to a Google-created platform for nearly all of their VR content.  Google launched its VR hub, Daydream, last year, and while it hasn't taken the smartphone market by storm yet, it doesn't have to -- at least not yet. This first iteration of Daydream was just the opening gambit in its long-term strategy to become the VR content hub for mobile users.  Remember that Alphabet built out its dominance in the smartphone space not with hardware, but with a platform (Android); Daydream could ultimately work in the same way. Already, there are over 100 Daydream VR apps available to customers, offering everything from gaming to movies, from the NBA and NFL to The New York Times, and more.  The big opportunity here is that no one else has the same reach that Alphabet does in the smartphone space. Daydream could become the gateway that brings more users into VR, and Alphabet could monetize this advantage in the same way it does with Android -- through ads and paid apps (about one-third of the Daydream apps cost money right now). Alphabet is keenly aware of the capacity for software and services to generate massive revenues, and I think the company's early focus on mobile VR -- through Daydream -- is an attempt to get out ahead of all of its competitors.  Why Facebook is a top virtual reality stock Just as we did with Alphabet, let's set aside the case for Facebook's VR hardware --- through the Oculus Rift -- for now. Instead, focus on the company's long-term view for VR: "This is a good candidate to be the next major computing platform. It's worthy of a lot of investment over a long period," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Bloomberg interview last year. Zuckerberg admits that VR could take 10 years or longer to take off, but  his company didn't spend $2 billion on Oculus solely to sell cool headsets -- Facebook's also using the hardware to accelerate the development of software and services. While it's easy to get caught up in the Rift hardware, its weak sales numbers, and the recent departure of Oculus' founder Palmer Luckey from Facebook, remember that the social media powerhouse is still at the beginning stages of its VR push. It first wanted to enter the hardware market to help spur demand for software. As Zuckerberg noted last year, "The next phase is building the next great software experiences." Long-term investors looking for the top stocks in VR would be wise to focus on these software plays -- and remember that it's likely to take awhile for this market to truly come into its own.

However, their responses suggested that they probably don't fully understand how it's being used today, including in the customer service realm. Researchers polled 6,000 adult consumers in the United States, the UK, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Seventy-two percent of the survey participants said they understood what was meant by "artificial intelligence." While 32 percent said they weren't sure if they had interacted with AI, 34 percent said they had. Another 34 percent said they had never had an AI interaction. However, 84 percent actually had come into contact with AI, based on the devices or services they actually used, such as virtual home assistants, intelligent chatbots, or systems that incorporate predictive suggestions, including Google search and spam filters. Perception vs. Reality Only 41 percent of respondents knew that AI powered the technology used in Google Home or Amazon Alexa, even though both products have been marketed as bringing intelligent assistants into the home. However, 57 percent recognized that Apple's Siri was based on AI. Researchers polled a roughly equal number of men and women. Eighty percent of the male respondents and 66 percent of the women thought they understood the meaning of "AI," but 60 percent of the women correctly identified that Siri was AI-powered compared to 54 percent of the men. Forty-three percent of the women said Alexa used AI, compared to 38 percent of the men. "We didn't provide a definition of 'AI' on purpose," noted Pegasystems CTO Don Schuerman. "We wanted to know what consumers associate with AI without leading them on," he told CRM Buyer. Respondents were't tested on their AI knowledge, but "given how complex AI is, we were surprised that 72 percent said they understand it," Schuerman noted. "Most consumers' perception of AI is tied to the image Hollywood has provided -- robots and intelligent mainframes," noted Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. They "don't see the impact AI is playing in the technologies they use," he told CRM Buyer. "If you pick up a smartphone and say, "Hello Google," there's no way to determine if the response was programmed or learned." That's changing because of increasing press coverage and the growth in the use of digital assistants, McGregor suggested. What People Think AI Can Do Asked what AI could do, 57 percent of the respondents said it could learn; 51 percent said it could think logically; and 50 percent said it could solve problems. Thirty-seven percent said it could interpret speech; 35 percent believed it could replicate human interaction; 31 percent feared it could replace humans in jobs; and 30 percent thought AI could store lots of data. Nineteen percent believed AI could play games. Exposure to AI can help reduce fear of the technology, the survey results suggest. Thirty-nine percent of non-AI users expressed neutral attitudes toward the technology; 25 percent said they were comfortable with it; and 36 percent said they were uncomfortable with AI. However, 55 percent of those who used AI said they were comfortable with the technology; 26 percent were neutral; and 19 percent were uncomfortable. Opportunities for Business Growth Nearly 40 percent of the respondents thought that AI would improve customer service. However, 38 percent did not believe that AI already delivered the same or better service than humans, while 27 percent thought it did. "Typically, AI is used in isolated pockets with limited functionality that doesn't follow the customer from initial contact to final outcome," Pega's Schuerman observed. "There's a lot of hype in the industry about AI in customer experience, but the customers just aren't seeing it yet." The proper use of AI can help businesses maintain or increase growth. For example, Sprint, which deployed Pegasystems' AI-based Pega Customer Decision Hub in just three months, saw its retention offers double, slashing post-paid churn by 50 percent, Schuerman said. The most important thing businesses can do, he suggested, is "make sure their AI-powered customer engagements are truly exceptional ones."

Joe Mullin - Apr 4, 2017 6:50 pm UTC Anthony Levandowski giving a presentation in Japan in 2011, when he worked for Google. shinnygogo reader comments 78 Share this story New legal filings in the Waymo v. Uber litigation lay out more of Google's allegations against ex-Googler Anthony Levandowski, who now heads up Uber's self-driving car unit. According to a Google document filed in court yesterday, Levandowski created "competing side businesses" as early as 2012 while he was still working for Google. That's when Levandowski is said to have incorporated a company called Odin Wave LLC, with a physical address at a building he owned in Berkeley, California. Further ReadingJudge steams as Uber exec withholds documents and pleads the 5thOdin Wave submitted an order to a hardware maker asking for a "customer-fabricated part" similar to what Google used in its self-driving cars. Google employees investigated Odin Wave, noted the connections to Levandowski, and questioned the engineer about it, but Levandowski denied having any ownership, according to Google lawyers. Google claims Odin Wave later merged with another LLC called Tyto Lidar, which ultimately became part of Otto—Levandowski's startup that was later acquired by Uber for $680 million. Levandowski not only started work on his competing self-driving car business while he still worked at Google, he tried to recruit more Googlers to join him, according to the filing. He worked together with a partner who also was at Google and whose name is redacted from the filings. However, as TechCrunch notes in its review of the new documents, the work history described matches that of Otto cofounder Lior Ron. Further ReadingGoogle’s Waymo sues Uber, alleging theft of trade secretsThe filing also notes that Levandowski received incentive payments from Google, but it redacts the amount in the public filing. Bloomberg reported that the incentive payments totaled more than $120 million. Google's Waymo division sued Uber last month, claiming that Uber's self-driving car technology is built on trade secrets illegally stolen from Google when Levandowski departed. Levandowski is not a defendant in the lawsuit and has separate counsel from Uber. According to news reports about a closed hearing last week, Levandowski's lawyer said his client would exercise his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid discussing documents related to the case. Waymo also submitted a letter to US District Judge William Alsup stating that Uber is willfully violating a court order to hand over key documents in the case. "Waymo notes that Mr. Levandowski remains—to this day—an Uber executive and in charge of its self driving car program," writes Waymo lawyer Charles Verhoeven.

He says it was meant to connect people and even though the web is now filled with "misogynistic bullies" and "nasty people" he's still optimistic about its potential. (Jesse Costa/WBUR) Each year, the Turing Award — named for World War II codebreaker and British computer scientist Alan Turing — comes with a million-dollar prize, courtesy of Google. This year, it's due to the recipient that Google even exists. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a paper at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) titled, "Information Management: A Proposal." And while the title isn't particularly flashy, the outcome has captured the entire world's attention: the world wide web. Originally, Berners-Lee was proposing a system to alleviate the problems created by the many different computers that CERN researchers used in their work. It wasn't always called the world wide web, however. Berners-Lee also considered "Mine of Information," "The Information Mine" — which was discarded because of its acronym, TIM — and simply, "The Mesh." "World wide web" won out, despite the fact that early journalists wrote to him saying it wasn't really "WWW", but "WW," because worldwide was technically one word. The web has changed significantly in the nearly three decades since its inception. When asked how he feels about the the threats to the web, including net neutrality, privacy and misinformation, Berners-Lee says, "I am optimistic." He also says the solutions are already beginning to be created but, "it's only gonna happen because lots of people care about [the web] very, very much. And that's not just people writing code." You can also hear our interview with 2014 Turing Award recipient, Michael Stonebraker here. Guest Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, director of the World Wide Web Consortium.

Here’s how to access it… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services Google Allo has some “bots,” the most prominent of which being Google Assistant which is accessible via the “@google” command within a chat. This allows you to ask questions to Google directly, which are answered within the stream of the app. Oddly, though, @google is currently the only option that appears when you type “@” in Allo. The “@yesno” bot is both oddly-named and somewhat hidden. Here’s how to make a yes/no poll in Allo: Open Google Allo Type “@yesno” Add the question you want to ask Send the message From there, @yesno will create the poll (but not before asking if it can close the previous poll if you already have one active). Everyone active in the conversation will be able to answer either yes or no (including yourself), with the results updated in live time. When you’re done, there’s a button you can tap that looks a lot like the “Done” check mark you might be familiar with if you use Inbox by Gmail. When you’re holding a group poll, anyone can start the poll and anyone can tap to end the poll as well. Additionally, if you tap the “X” to dismiss the poll, you have to tap the “yesno” icon at the top-right of the screen next to your group’s current avatar.

There were some pretty intense clashes – Philippe Poutou certainly made François Fillon and Marine Le Pen feel his presence – but it was, in the main, civilised and orderly, despite the number of candidates and variety of arguments. Thanks for joining us this evening. Et bon nuit! Updated at 7.02pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.53pm EDT 18:53 Candidates summarise their position • Fillon says France is in a serious situation in a dangerous world and in order to rediscover the “taste of happiness” a profound change is needed. He says he is the only candidate who can do it – bringing together the right and the centre. He tells voters if they don’t want the chaos of extremists or a continuation of François Hollande they should choose him. He ends with a bold demand: “I ask [the French] to trust me.” François Fillon (@FrancoisFillon) Je suis aujourd'hui le seul candidat qui propose l'alternance et qui peut la mettre en œuvre avec une vraie majorité. #LeGrandDébat April 4, 2017 • Macron says he is asking voters to turn the page, not just on the last five years but on the last 20. He is calling for a new, efficient, can-do France where all sections of society are liberated. He says the most vulnerable will be protected, and others will be liberated by education and culture. “I have confidence in you,” he says. “I have confidence in our country.” Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) Je veux porter un projet d’émancipation, un projet qui vous redonnera la fierté d’être Français. #Macron2017 #LeGrandDébat pic.twitter.com/MP8s6YZgVq April 4, 2017 • Le Pen calls on French who think they are part of a people and a culture in danger. She tells them they are the owners of the country, and they have rights. There is no reason to despair, she tells them. It is possible to come through this and regain our sovereignty. I want to put France in order, in your name, she says. Marine Le Pen (@MLP_officiel) "Français, usez de cette liberté pour me permettre de remettre la France en ordre, au votre nom : #AuNomDuPeuple !" #LeGrandDébat April 4, 2017 • Mélenchon concludes by explaining that France must end the reign of the ultra-rich and emphasising that they must move towards environmentally friendly methods of production and consumption. He says that the republic is about a life of community and that this election is of course about changing the president, but first and foremost about rediscovering happiness. CNEWS (@CNEWS) #LeGrandDébat : la conclusion de @JLMelenchon, candidat de La France Insoumise pic.twitter.com/qfb8pgL3LT April 4, 2017 • Hamon calls for voters to choose the future of collective intelligence and ecological transition that he proposes. He says that the people “embody the most beautiful face of the republic” and seeks to unite them regardless of religion, which has always been the project of the left. Benoît Hamon (@benoithamon) Ils veulent vous désunir, je veux vous rassembler. Seul on va plus vite mais ensemble on ira plus loin #HamonElysee pic.twitter.com/OH9Cj0zaND April 4, 2017 • Poutou concludes by encouraging the social movement in Guyana, where he says their wealth is monopolised by the French state, and by reaching out to all those who are exploited globally, not just in France. He wants the French to regain their confidence in social movements and to make the rich pay. • Arthaud concludes by addressing the workers and calling on them to remember the struggle of the collective. She refers to pensions in particular and her concern that the next president could cut pensions. • Cheminade says France can only be happy if it overcomes the oppression of capitalism and insists a vote for him is a vote for the future. • Dupont-Aignan concludes by citing Einstein: it is not those who have created the problems that can solve them. He says he believes in a humanistic patriotism and he can not stand to see it submissive and divided. He wants to gather the French together for the longevity of the Republic. • Asselineau says to finish that he is the only candidate who would ensure an immediate “Frexit”. He tells voters not to be afraid and to have confidence that France will renew its great history as the British people have just done. • And finally, the jolly giant Lassalle says he wants a France that invests in its youth – and says that as president he would invest in the learning of languages and military service. Updated at 7.00pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.21pm EDT 18:21 Candidates asked: What is your social model? FRANCE 24 #Politique (@PolitiqueF24) #LeGrandDebat - Place à la 3ème partie du débat : comment mettre en oeuvre votre modèle social ? ➡️ https://t.co/e3cnlQlge8 April 4, 2017 • Le Pen says that public services come in for a lot of criticism. She says public service must not be for profit. She wants to improve public services – so they benefit the French, bien sur. • Fillon agrees with Cheminade that France is headed for a financial crisis. He therefore wants to rebalance public finances and says this would require exceptional measures, namely eliminating 8% of jobs in the public sector at the rate of 1.5% per year. • Macron says it is time to stop lying to the French people. Public services are “the foundation of our equality”, but they need reform, otherwise it is future generations who will have to pay. To save as much as €60bn, he suggests that local and regional authorities should not replace retiring civil servants. He also wants to abolish the housing tax for 80% of French people. • Mélenchon calls for recruitment of more civil servants in the health and education sectors respectively. • Poutou wants to declare a “state of social emergency” as a result of unemployment, bad pensions and difficulties in accessing housing. He takes another swipe at Fillon, who he says is preoccupied with debt “except when he draws in the cash for his family”. He wants to cancel France’s debt and to tax the ultra-rich. • Lassalle agrees with Arthaud and denounces those with large fortunes. His big plan is to put an end to petrol and says there are plenty of jobs to be had in solar power. The French Report (@thefrenchreport) "I propose to defend our public services by modernising it"#macron2017 #LeGrandDebat April 4, 2017 • Asselineau argues that the EU is responsible for the dismantling of public services. He proposes the renationalisation of French public services. He wants social security to be included in the Constitution and to introduce “pay-as-you-go” retirement. • Dupont-Aignan says there must be an end to the privatisation of public services, calling for motorways to be renationalised. But the answer is not more public servants. • Hamon vigorously attacks Fillon on his proposal to reduce the number of civil servants. He says during the financial crisis, it was the civil servants who held the country together. He says that Fillon must respect those who will implement policies for the civil service, especially seeing as he wants to be head of state. Hamon touches again on the issue of burnout when referring to those civil servants working in hospitals, schools and police stations. He says France should recruit more civil servants.

Arthaud and Poutou represent workers’ rights as one might expect from leaders of the Workers’ Struggle party and the New Anticapitalist party; the poor, the badly paid, those at the bottom of the social pile, the “dictatorship” of the rich and of capitalism. At the other end of the scale, are former ministers Fillon and Macron, in their well-cut bespoke suits and ties who talk of finance, business, investment, efficiency, responsibility … In the middle are leftwingers Mélenchon in his Mao jacket and Hamon, in off-the-peg suit and tie, who focus on workers but also ecological issues, democracy, working hours, social services … There are traditionalists Dupont-Aignan, Asselineau, Cheminade, Lassalle: Eurosceptics, nationalists who have their pet subjects. Then there’s Le Pen, who takes a bit from each – nationalist, protectionist, anti-Europe, anti-globalist, defence of workers (as long as they are French) – and adds her trademark dose of anti-Islam, anti-immigration, and economic and social patriotism. Updated at 6.33pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.24pm EDT 17:24 Macron and Fillon trade blows on reform of the political system. Macron says reform is crucial, that he will reduce the number of parliamentarians and the number of laws they make. Fillon hits back, saying that even if there are corrections to make, they are not a priority. They would be a diversion from economic and social policies which – at this moment – are more important. Updated at 5.31pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.15pm EDT 17:15 It’s now Macron’s past career at Rothschild bank thrust into the spotlight by Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who asks him: “Should we not stop with these banks that dethrone our industry?” Macron defends his previous banking job, explaining that he had a job and practiced a profession, “I had a job, I practiced a profession” and that he sees nothing wrong with that. In response to Dupont-Aignan’s interrogation, Macron recognises that although there is a need for transparency and accountability, there cannot be too much suspicion. He says that there will always be banks and that he would guarantee their total independence. Thomas Ménagé (@Thomas_Mng) Le thème de l'exemplarité : Nicolas @dupontaignan le seul à s'être engagé avec une charte éthique en 10 points ! pic.twitter.com/aikPzMVFwH April 4, 2017 Meanwhile Hamon calls for an end to the “unbearable privileges” of politicians who can get away with things that ordinary French citizens cannot. He says there should be complete transparency when it comes to donations to electoral campaigns. Arthaud also attacks Le Pen and Fillon, saying that workers have to take accountability while they do not. Workers are encouraged to stand up and take responsibility for their actions and therefore so should politicians. Macron is all for the transparency in the public lives of politicians. He would prohibit family members being hired by politicians, an obvious dig at Fillon.

He says an exemplary president is one that tells the truth to France about itself and the world. He says he has been judged without a trial by journalists, but he is “not intimidated”.

It’s worth noting that Poutou means “kiss” in French, and the politician is sometimes mocked for this. But as Kim puts it, “he’s the outsider’s outsider”. On Fillon, he says the more you look, the more stories there are and accuses Fillon of telling the public they must tighten their belts while stealing from public funds. Oof. Then he accuses Le Pen of stealing from the European public funds. The background is that Le Pen refused to turn up to a summons to answer questions about European parliament funds being used to pay for FN party staff, including, it’s reported, her personal bodyguard. Fillon is formally under investigation for paying his wife and two children hundreds of thousands of euros for jobs they allegedly did not do. Hamon says it’s rich to see Le Pen presenting herself as a victim, when she victimises Muslims, immigrants etc. Updated at 5.13pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.41pm EDT 16:41 How to protect the French? We are now on the second theme of the debate: how to protect the French people. • Macron says that to protect the French people some military intervention will be necessary, adding that we all face the threat of terrorism and that one cannot deny that “Islamist terrorism” exists. He argues that France’s military intervention in Syria is vital, but that there needs to be a change in how security is organised on French soil. He suggests a reconstruction of territorial intelligence, as well as stressing the importance of cyber-defence. Macron refers to the recent attacks in Westminster and St Petersburg before insisting that we target the source of the problem. MacronInEnglish (@MacronInEnglish) "I want to eradicate the terrorist threat at its source" #macron #LeGrandDebat #TeamMacron #macron2017 https://t.co/q0oM3maRcb April 4, 2017 • Le Pen argues that terrorism cannot be prevented unless France’s borders are made secure. She accuses Fillon of cutting police and army numbers as prime minister (which he later denies, saying army numbers are the same today as in 2012). Le Pen says that France has become a “jihadi university”, causing an exasperated interruption from Hamon who says that she would say that as it suits her and helps her cause. Kim Willsher (@kimwillsher1) #LeGrandDebat Security/terrorism are Le Pen's subjects. Enable her to get worked up about migrants, Islamists, borders, etc., April 4, 2017 • Fillon says France must fight totalitarianism but it will be “a long fight” that requires the strongest and largest global alliance possible. He says he will stop jihadis coming back to France and deport those who pose a risk. Antonio Barroso (@abarrous) Le Pen going hard against Fillon on security issues. She knows he is the main contender on that front #LeGrandDebat April 4, 2017 • Hamon says there is no miracle solution or “quick fix” to terrorism and that in Russia, where there is less public freedom, attacks are still not prevented. He says the French must fight terrorism united and suggests a small increase in spending on armed forces and security services. • Melénchon says that France must leave its state of emergency and echoes Hamon’s argument that the country should remain united in the face of terrorism. He also insists France must “punish the accomplices” of the terrorists. • Poutou wants to end the state of emergency and to disarm police, saying that police kill youths rather than fighting terrorism. In order to put an end to terrorism, he says, France should stop its military interventions “in the Middle East and Iraq” and to end the sale of weapons “in Qatar and Saudi Arabi, which finance terrorism”. • Asselineau says he wants France to quit Nato and the EU. He also wants to put an end to “complacency” towards the Emirates, “which serve as a financial base for the Islamists”, in order to fight effectively against terrorism. • Lassalle, who has previously met Bashar al-Assad in Syria, encourages talks with the Syrian president and an immediate withdrawal of French forces from the Middle East. He also says he will create a fourth army to fight cybercrime, because they are young people who “want to destroy our civilisation”. • Cheminade argues there should be more emphasis on the fight against arms, drugs and oil traffic in order to neutralise Islamic State “once and for all”. France must treat terrorism “at its source”, intervening in Chad and Mali. He calls for a coordinated international policy, even if this means working closely with Trump and Putin.

We had a lot of sound and fury, but no clear winner. Fillon seems to be trying to appear statesmanlike, lots of sardonic smiles, but keeping out of arguments. Hamon struggling, lacking the passion he shows at rallies. Mélenchon continues to combine being combative with humorous asides and interjections, and coming out of the debate well. Macron earnest, but not really hitting the mark. Le Pen … is just being Le Pen and sticking to her line.

Macron, with his eyes on the prize of a second round victory against Marine Le Pen, directs his final comments directly at the Front National leader. He cites Mitterrand’s “nationalism equals war” . He adds that France is not Switzerland, or North Korea. He puts the point to her, while she rolls her eyes. Fillon, ever determined to bring the debate back to the economy, says that Le Pen has no economic plan. The only plan she has is to leave Europe, which will melt away when the French public vote to stay in any referendum she would hold.

Cheminade says that a “financial tsunami” is coming. In response to Cheminade’s desire to implement article 50 immediately, citing the daily suicides of farmers as a reason enough “to act”, Le Pen affirms that the difference between the two is that she wants a referendum and he doesn’t. Jean Lassalle reiterates that France needs room to make changes, but without a “Frexit”. He takes aim at Macron, arguing that there is now “no government or European authority”. Arguing that he has not spoken enough in this first part of the debate, Mélenchon says that “no one” in the previous two governments had opposed the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and claimed that it was now necessary to adopt “a reasonable attitude with an alternative proposal”. He says renegotiate European treaties and then ask the French if they agree.

Among the top five, however, three are pro-Europe (with or without reforms) Macron, Fillon, Hamon; and two are Eurosceptic, Le Pen who wants out totally, and Mélenchon who wants to “renegotiate” the European treaties. Asselineau mentions the B-word: Brexit. Says he is the only candidate for Frexit. Wants France to invoke article 50. In contrast to the Eurosceptics, Hamon says he wants to continue with the challenge of building Europe. However, he opposes Germany’s austerity policy, proposing instead a democratisation of the countries in the eurozone. He believes Germany would work with France to improve democracy in Europe. Fillon also argues that France needs Europe, when up against the US and China. He insists that a European currency that can compete with the supremacy of the dollar and the future of the Chinese currency must be worked on. He also says that the prohibition of free movement of workers is “absurd”, although he emphasises a need for the sovereignty of Europe, which in turn will ensure the sovereignty of France. There has been an ill-tempered exchange between Dupont-Aignan and Fillon. Fillon says Dupont-Aignan isn’t going to get the power to do anything, but Dupont-Aignan says that’s up to the voters.

He was the founding editor of the Russian business daily Vedomosti and founded the opinion website Slon.ru. Read More. @Bershidsky April 4, 2017 11:02 AM EDT a | A By Leonid Bershidsky This year, Android is donning the crown of the world's No. 1 operating system, both in terms of the number of devices that use it and the revenue its ecosystem generates. As an Android user, I don't really mind -- but there are ominous aspects to its growing dominance and a possibility that better technology may not get the recognition it deserves. StatCounter, the web analytics company, reports that Android devices accounted for 37.93 percent of global internet traffic, just ahead of Windows' 37.91 percent. That's remarkable, considering that most people use some version of Windows on computers at work. Given the mobile operating system's momentum as people spend more time on their phones, the scale will soon tip further in Android's favor. On the revenue side, Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, has long been the dominant moneymaker. AppAnnie, a firm that keeps tabs on the app economy, predicts, however, that it will be displaced by Android this year. While Apple's App Store will still collect almost twice as much revenue as the Google Play store, owned by Google's parent Alphabet Inc., third-party Android app stores will make sure that the Google operating system tops iOS. Android, King of the App Universe Annual consumer spending in app stores   Source: App Annie *Forecasts Alphabet doesn't say how much it's making from Android, nor does Apple break out the App Store in its financial reports. Last year, Oracle, which sued Google for copyright infringement, disclosed a number in court: It claimed the Android revenue reached $33 billion between 2008 and 2015. There is no comparable number for Apple, but Android has a certain business model advantage: Part of the revenue comes from Google's main business -- ads shown to users in the Google apps that come with Android. That revenue stream, which Apple doesn't have, may well compensate for Alphabet's lack of control over the third-party stores. Android is the ugly duckling of the operating-system world. It's technically open-source and free to use, so device makers like to tweak it. That creates chaos and often lowers the quality of the user experience, which advanced users try to fix by messing with the system themselves. Because of the variety of Android flavors and hardware on which the system runs, updates are intermittent for most users -- those who don't own a Google-branded or co-branded device. Though the general interface design has approved in recent years, it can sometimes feel raw and less convenient than that of Apple's sleek iOS. Many, including myself, like Android because it can be an exciting set of building blocks for a little boy (or girl). That it's winning the operating system race is exciting to those who, like me, have argued that the open-source approach is the most progressive. Besides, Alphabet's push to turn phones into virtual reality devices is an interesting vision for the future of a gadget that's getting harder and harder to improve. But Android's emerging dominance is also worrying for two reasons. One is privacy. The reason Android is free is that Google, Alphabet's main unit, is an advertising company that collects lots of data about users. Given the erosion of privacy protections, I'm not sure Google is the platform on which I'd like to do most of my personal computing. The other problem with Android's ascendancy is that it's not a good operating system for desktops and laptops. The three major operating-system makers -- Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft -- have chosen distinct approaches to handling different kinds of devices. Apple creates a separate system for every device category -- the MacOS for laptops and desktops, the iOS for phones and tablets, and separate systems for wearables and set-top boxes. Alphabet is trying to make a mobile system usable on devices equipped with a hardware keyboard. Android apps run on Chromebooks, and Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 smartphone can be turned into a desktop machine by using a special dock. But many of the apps run in phone size in the middle of a big screen, and many desktop apps to which Windows and Mac users are accustomed are not available for Android. It's an irritating compromise. Microsoft has the most promising approach: It's trying to port its desktop operating system to mobile devices. That its Surface laptop-tablet hybrids run the full version of Windows is a major competitive advantage over competing products using iOS and Android. Microsoft has also tweaked Windows so that it can now run on ARM processors, the architecture used in mobile devices. This appears to be the most promising approach to the seamless use of the same apps across various devices. But Microsoft has botched its smartphone project so badly that even selling phones with the full version of Windows -- which will truly turn the pocket device into a scalable computer -- would probably be an uphill battle.  If Android's dominance keeps growing and Microsoft cannot sell the public on its superior vision, that will mean a victory for suboptimal technology, something I, for one, would be sorry to see.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Inventor of World Wide Web wins computing’s ‘Nobel Prize’ Tue Apr 4th, 2017 11:14am BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By MICHAEL LIEDTKE / Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO — Most people who search on Google, share on Facebook and shop on Amazon have never heard of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year’s recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing’s version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. “It’s a crowning achievement,” Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help.” The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee’s efforts to make the internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video — everything, really, beyond plain text — online. SPINNING THE WEB Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world’s first website, http://info.cern.ch. Besides coming up with the web’s technical specifications, Berners-Lee “offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole,” said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he’d laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. CAUGHT IN THE WEB The web’s widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the U.S. and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the web will become less accessible in the U.S. if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting “net neutrality.” That’s the principle that internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, “it’s going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realize it’s important,” Berners-Lee said. “It allowed America to benefit from a thriving internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America.” Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a “recurrent threat.” He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn’t have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is “really important to the future of society,” he says. “As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person.” BEYOND THE WEB Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn’t sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. “Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so It’s only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us,” Berners-Lee said. “So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences.” This is the 50th anniversary of the A.M. Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany’s codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web.   Most Read Street Smarts Survey of US 2 trestle commuters will help guide future fix LAKE STEVENS — The state launches a survey Monday aimed at those… Apr 3rd, 2017 by Melissa Slager Arlington takes steps to solve homelessness, addiction ARLINGTON — City leaders want to take inventory of local resources for… Apr 3rd, 2017 by Kari Bray Lake Stevens works to accommodate influx of kindergarteners LAKE STEVENS — As work continues on a new elementary school here,… Apr 3rd, 2017 by Kari Bray ‘Phony Pony Bandit’ drops $6.3 million lawsuit against county EVERETT — A man who was shot by police while robbing a… Apr 3rd, 2017 by Rikki King Calling BS: UW course aims to counter a profane new problem Students couldn’t help but chuckle as University of Washington biology professor Carl… Apr 4th, 2017 by Quinn Russell Brown © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

Feedly’s reader app now caters to knowledge workers with launch of boards, notes & annotations Posted 13 hours ago by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story This new sentiment index aims to help founders time their fundraising Following the death of Google Reader several years ago, there was a brief renewed interest in alternative RSS readers – news readers that let you track updates from blogs or other websites in a single interface. While there was a lot of hype around Digg’s entry into the space, it’s Feedly that has best picked up the Google Reader mantle, and continued to roll out features aimed at those who ingest, save and reference a large number of news items on a regular basis. Today, Feedly is adding to its feature set again with a series of updates that turn its reader into a more powerful knowledge board creation tool. Like most RSS readers on the market, Feedly already allows you to subscribe to feeds, organize them into folders, mark content for later reading, share posts across social media, and tag articles for later access, among other things. Today, Feedly is introducing Boards, a feature that makes it easier to organize the stories you want to save for yourself, or share with others on a team. This latter addition, Team Boards, is ideal for business users and co-workers who want to track stories about clients, projects or other interests. The functionality of Boards replaces tags for all users – Basic, Pro (a paid tier) and Teams. Instead of clicking a button to tag an article, you now click a star icon instead to add it to a board of your choosing. If it’s the first time you’ve used boards, Feedly will ask you to create one by entering in a name. Like tagging, however, you can save a story to multiple boards. And you can still save stories to read it later-style services, like Pocket and Instapaper, if you choose. The Teams product is where Boards can become even more useful. You can track website feeds, Twitter feeds for accounts, lists and hashtags, as well as Google keyword alerts. When you save one of these items to a Board, you can now mark it up with added context. For example, you can highlight key parts of an article and annotate the article with your expanded thoughts or ideas. Plus, you can notify fellow teammates using integrated Slack and email mentions. This curated set of content can additionally be used to build out email newsletters based on the stories you’ve saved in the Boards. Items can also be shared out to social media, including through Buffer, LinkedIn, and Hootsuite, either immediately or on a scheduled basis. An API is available, too, with integrations into workflow systems like IFTTT or Zapier. What’s interesting about Feedly’s development over the years is that it demonstrates the potential that Google squandered by shuttering its own RSS Reader, instead of realizing how it could have been modernized to become a paid toolset for researchers, knowledge workers, and businesses. It also ties in nicely with the growing interest in email newsletters as a way to reach an audience. Boards, Notes, and Highlights will also work on any device including the web and mobile, via the Feedly app. Basic accounts can only create up to 3 private Boards. For unlimited boards, you’ll need to upgrade to Pro ($5/mo.) or Teams ($18/mo. per user).   0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Feedly Description Feedly is a news aggregator application that compiles news feeds from online sources for users to customize and share with friends.

[Shutterstock - Studio_Loona]    Clerical Mistake Unmasks One Of The Men Behind A Massive Google Lawsuit Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 1:54 PM 04/04/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5572423 The name of one of the cofounders of a self-driving startup owned by Uber called Otto was mistakenly revealed after court documents failed to completely conceal all aspects of his identity in a lawsuit with Google. Lior Ron’s name was blackened out (redacted) in almost every area of the 68-page document, reports Business Insider. But on the final page, his first name is showed in one portion, with only the last name obscured. Just underneath this section, his last name is revealed in the formal title (Google v. Levandowski and Ron) of the demand for arbitration. Uber adamantly attempted to keep Ron out of the spotlight after Waymo, the driverless car company owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company, issued a lawsuit against Uber, Otto and the other cofounder Anthony Levandowski. Waymo accuses Levandowski, amongst other things, of stealing the company’s blueprint for the LiDAR sensor, which helps a vehicle map the environment around it, and thus is a critical component for autonomous functionality. (RELATED: Google Says Employee Was Secretly Building Another Company While They Paid Him $120 Million) Ron, though, is part of the lawsuit because Google alleges that while Levandowski was still working for the tech conglomerate, the two conspired to poach employees by using confidential employee data, like salary information, according to Business Insider. (RELATED: Uber Exec Refuses To Testify After Google Sues Company For Stealing Self-Driving Tech) Ron was supposed to keep a low profile in the case, since the vast majority of the accusations are levied against Levandowski, with the purported transgressions occurring while he was at Google.

They’re not as good as Jose Mourinho would have you think. But they are still unbeaten in the league since October, Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s last-gasp penalty rescuing them, so that’s something. But they’re still fifth and they’ve missed another chance to put pressure on Manchester City. They’re four points behind them. As for Everton, they’ll be kicking themselves. They led for so long, didn’t make the most of several late counterattacks and gave away an equaliser at the death. They stay seventh and that’s probably where they’ll be after 38 matches.

United have a free-kick on the right now. Meanwhile a replay of Ibrahimovic’s disallowed goal suggests he might have been onside. It was very tight. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.33pm EDT 16:33 75 min: Rojo and De Gea almost get themselves into a mess after dithering with a bouncing ball, almost letting in Lukaku, but the Argentinian mops up before calamity descends upon United.

This has been a tortured attacking performance. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.24pm EDT 16:24 66 min: United have made all their substitutions now, so we won’t be seeing Anthony Martial this evening.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.23pm EDT 16:23 65 min: Before Everton can take the corner, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the lesser spotted Luke Shaw come on for Michael Carrick and Ashley Young. Nothing comes from the corner.

It was a half chance at best.

The travelling support is noisy. Mirallas whips it in and Barkley sends a low header straight at De Gea. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.15pm EDT 16:15 57 min: The players of both teams are engaged in philosophical debate after Mirallas decides to attack from a drop ball, provoking Young into clattering him. Eventually Young, who was involved in a spot of nonsense with Holgate a few minutes earlier, is booked. The temperature is rising. The players clash. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters Updated at 4.21pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.13pm EDT 16:13 55 min: Young’s free-kick is flatter and more dangerous this time.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.07pm EDT 16:07 50 min: Barkley is losing the ball a lot. He has to do better in tight spaces when he’s under pressure.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.43pm EDT 15:43 43 min: Barkley crumples in a heap on the edge of the United area. The free-kick goes to United.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Google Play will stop supporting Gifts, Requests, and Quests on March 31, 2018 Emil Protalinski@EPro April 4, 2017 10:41 AM Tags: Android, Google, google play, Google Play Games Services Google is cutting more features from its mobile game developer offering Google Play Games Services (GPGS). The company plans to stop supporting Gifts, Requests, and Quests on March 31, 2018. That gives Android developers 12 months to plan for their removal. Google says developers use engagement and reporting tools extensively, but cites “lower usage” for Gifts, Requests, and Quests. The company did not specify how many developers or games would be affected by this feature cut. GPGS offers tools to build, analyze, and retain gamers. Google said the change comes after “listening to developer feedback and examining usage” and that it will be able to “focus on making our offering more useful.” The plan is to continue supporting features such as Sign-in, Achievements, Leaderboards, and Multiplayer. That could of course change, but Google insists it is committed to supporting game developers: Play games services remains an important part of the tools we provide developers, and we’re working hard on future GPGS updates. We continue to be strongly committed to providing high quality services for Games, including new tools such as official Firebase support for Unity and C++ developers, and integration with Firebase Analytics. These changes allow us to focus our efforts on the services developers value most to build high quality, engaging games. This is not the first cut Google has made to GPGS. In December, the company announced that it was ending support for the creation of new iOS accounts, the latest Native SDK release (version 2.3) would no longer support integration with iOS, and the iOS SDK would not be supported nor updated.

On Tuesday, the company announced Espresso, a system that provides increased network performance to users of the company’s applications. It works by applying software-defined networking to the edge of the tech titan’s network, where Google connects to the peer networks of other internet service providers. Rather than rely on individual routers to figure out the best way to direct internet traffic, Espresso hands off that responsibility to servers running in the data centers that Google operates at the edge of its network. [ Further reading: Amazon Web Services vs. Microsoft Azure vs. Google Cloud Platform ] Espresso aggregates all the data about network performance from across its peering points and uses that to dynamically direct traffic to users. That allows Google to offer major performance improvements, instead of sending users information from a static point based on their IP addresses or the addresses of their DNS resolvers. “And we’ve actually pulled the brains of the routing protocol out of individual routers,” Google Fellow Amin Vahdat said. “So we no longer have all of the functionality residing on high-end routers, we actually can leverage more commodity devices, more commodity network elements, and push all of the functionality out of the router boxes onto our server banks.” Google A Google data center. Espresso is the fourth major software-defined network project Google has announced publicly. It builds on the company’s Jupiter data center interconnect project, Andromeda network function virtualization stack, and B4, a globally deployed software-defined wide area network. The system has been running in production at Google for longer than two years, and it currently handles about 20 percent of the company’s traffic. The company’s legacy networking infrastructure handles the other 80 percent, but all new capacity uses Espresso. Vahdat didn’t provide an exact timetable for when Espresso would handle all of the company’s traffic, but said the transition is “moving quickly.” Google is touting the performance benefits of Espresso not just for its consumer customers, but for the companies that choose it to provide cloud services. Companies transferring information between their on-premises data centers and Google Cloud Platform will see improved performance as a result of Espresso, Vahdat said. In addition, they will benefit from Google’s networking investments when serving information from the company’s cloud over the public internet, he said. Google handles roughly a quarter of the world’s internet traffic and has touted that expertise as a key part of its value to customers, compared to companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

According to some Galaxy Note Edge owners, it also brings battery life problems along with it. With that in mind, we want to take an in-depth look at how to potentially fix bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life before and after Android 5.0 Lollipop. In September, Samsung took the curtain down from around its Galaxy Note Edge. As expected, the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge debuted with all sorts of bells and whistles including a new design, an improved display, a solid camera, and Android 4.4.4 KitKat. At the time, Android 4.4.4 KitKat was the most current version of Google’s mobile operating system. Given the Galaxy Note Edge’s status as a flagship, it was no surprise that it was among the first Samsung Galaxy smartphones to get Google’s new mobile OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop. The Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop update started rolling earlier this year and it delivers some big time features to Galaxy Note Edge users. Some have already gotten a taste of the changes, others are still waiting for the update to start rolling out. While the Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop update brings some huge changes to the device, it also brings Android 5.0 Lollipop problems including the usual array of battery life issues. Complaints about bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life have started to pick up as the software’s moved out to more variants and more regions around the world including the United States. Battery life issues always seem to plague Galaxy users after a new Android update though most of the time it’s not the actual update that’s causing the problems. Apps and other services are usually the culprit. For the moment, these Galaxy Note Edge battery life problems appear to be somewhat isolated though we do expect them to grow as more updates roll out. How to Fix Bad Galaxy Note Edge Battery Life With that in mind, we want to try and fix bad Samsung Galaxy Note Edge battery life for you. This guide delivers help to get better battery life on Samsung’s current flagship. These fixes should work if you’re on Android 4.4 KitKat or if you’re on Android 5.0 Lollipop. We’ve geared this towards Android 5.0 Lollipop users but we know that plenty of people remain on the older version of Google’s software. Find Apps Eating Up Your Battery The first recommendation we always make to people suffering from bad battery life is to check out third-party applications before doing anything else. Some people listen, some don’t. If you want to fix your bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life, you’re going to want to keep an eye on your applications for potential problems. Third-party apps have a tendency to put a huge dent into the battery life on smartphones regardless of the software that’s running on board. If you use an application a lot, it’s going to drain your battery but there are also times where bugs or issues might cause an app to go rogue and start abnormally draining the device’s charge. The first thing you’ll want to do is head into your settings and start taking a look at the effect that Galaxy Note Edge applications are having on the device’s battery life. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, it’s time to dig in. If you think an app is draining more battery life than it should be, try reinstalling it to see if that corrects the issue. If the problem persists, try uninstalling it to see if that has a positive effect. If you can’t figure out which app might be causing trouble, you’ll want to boot the Galaxy Note Edge into Safe Mode in an effort to single out potential troublemakers. Booting the device into Safe Mode disables third-party apps and allows you to isolate apps that could be causing the problems. Here’s how to boot the Galaxy Note Edge into Safe Mode: Power down the device. Then, press & hold the Power button and volume down key. Once it boots up, you can let go of the power button but keep the volume key held down. When you have successfully entered into Safe Mode, you will notice the text ‘Safe Mode’ at the bottom left corner of the screen. Restart the Galaxy Note Edge If you start noticing weird battery drain and or your Galaxy Note Edge starts heating up, you should try performing a simple restart to see if that returns things to normal. Most of you know how to restart the Galaxy Note Edge but we’ll remind you anyway. Hold down the power button, confirm that you want to turn it off, and then hold the power button down to turn it back on. We recommend doing this a few times a month to flush your device’s cache. Disable Unnecessary Services If your apps aren’t the problem and a simple restart doesn’t work, it’s time to start fiddling with some settings and working on some of your daily habits. In our experience, disabling features when they aren’t in use tends to have a positive impact on overall battery life. We recommend shutting off Wi-Fi connectivity when you don’t need it, Bluetooth connectivity when you don’t need it, NFC when you don’t need it, GPS when you don’t need it, and cellular data when you don’t need it. You can turn all of those off from inside the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge’s settings and you can easily monitor them with a quick swipe down from the top of the device’s screen. One thing that we’ve noticed is that poor cellular coverage is often to blame for bad Android battery life. When your Galaxy Note Edge needs to search hard for a signal, it runs the battery down faster, so keep that in mind when you’re in spotty areas. You may need to turn on Airplane Mode when there isn’t a strong 4G or LTE signal in the area. Try Using a Black Wallpaper Switching to a black wallpaper could help deliver better Galaxy Note Edge battery life thanks to the way Samsung’s Super AMOLED displays consume power. The device does not come with a default black wallpaper but you can search online for one. There are tons of them out there. After you’ve downloaded one, go to Settings, Wallpaper, Home and Lock Screens, More Images, and then set your black Galaxy Note Edge wallpaper. It’s a quick fix but there’s a chance that it will help. Start Using Its Built-in Software Features The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge comes equipped with two software features that you should know about if you’re experiencing bad battery life or if you’re concerned about the potential for bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life. If you head into the device’s Settings, you’ll notice two features. One is called Power Saving mode. The other is called Ultra Power Saving Mode. These features allow you to block background data and turn on grayscale mode which can help to limit the amount of juice being sucked up. You can also slow down the processor, reduce screen performance, turn off the lights on the buttons, and turn off GPS to save battery life. We also recommend getting familiar with the the Galaxy Note Edge’s brightness slider. The Galaxy Note Edge’s powerful display can suck up battery life so you’ll want to monitor the brightness of the screen if you’re starting to notice bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life. If auto-brightness isn’t working out, try doing it manually. Replace the Stock Launcher You also might want to consider replacing the stock TouchWiz launcher on the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge with something new. Samsung’s TouchWiz launcher has been known to hinder performance and it can be replaced. There are tons of different launches to choose from though the Nova Launcher is one of Android’s most popular choices. Give that a try if these other simple fixes don’t work out. Downgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat If you’ve already moved to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and some of you have, note that you can return to Android 4.4 KitKat in the event that Android 5.0 isn’t to your liking. We recently put together a guide on how to accomplish this so that’s going to be a great starting point for those of you that want to drop back down to Android 4.4. Factory Reset the Galaxy Note Edge If you don’t want to downgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat and you can’t find any fixes for your battery problems, you can factory reset your Galaxy Note Edge. This will wipe all of your files so you’ll need to make a backup before going this route. To factory reset the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, go into Settings, User & Backup, and select Backup and Reset. From there, select Factory Data Reset. From there, select Reset Device and then Delete All. If nothing works, contact your carrier or Samsung. If you’re under warranty, you might be able to finagle your way into getting another device, or at the very least, a replacement battery. 9 Responses 05/20/2015 Jim Carter Reply The Lollipop update was certainly responsible for my battery/overheating issues as evidenced by flawless KitKat performance followed by immediate post update issues. There were no app additions, subtractions or updates. Upon seeing such stark evidence, I did a factory reset and all was well once again. Smartphones are no different than Windows PCs when it comes to OS updates. A clean install versus one OS on top of another is always the best choice. 05/26/2016 Carl Reply Soon tired of the remedies for fixing battery drain after an update.. If it wasn’t a problem before the update why should I have to go through all this crap of uninstalling all these apps BLACK WALLPAPER WTF? I didn’t buy this phone to make all kinds of changes these are not fixes but down grades on an expensive phone, this is useless info. 09/26/2016 Adam Reply I agree with Carl ^^^ 10/09/2016 Sergey Reply Usless article, misleading title. 10/29/2016 Deneiro Reply My phone is one year old, still making payments , went to Verizon , they told me to go buy a new battery, 30.00 dollars later I’m still pissed off 01/03/2017 Douglas Edwards Reply My Note Edge reboots when I still have 68% battery. A full charge with light to medium use last about 5 hours. I am considering tossing this and getting an IPhone. 02/10/2017 Bea Reply Yup, as well, Im still paying for my phone and it randomly shuts off and continuously reboots itself until I connect it to a charger. The jacked up part about it is I call T-Mobile and they suggested buying a new 30$ battery. WTF man! AND, I cant even talk on the damn thing in my house; shotty connectivity and doesnt matter if its wifi or data. Im just done with T-Mobile and Samsung…I will have to find another device that actually works as expected. Oh and my bill is over 200$ a month for two phones. 03/04/2017 Joe Reply Having the same problem with my Edge – starts resetting itself at around 37% – even with a brand new battery. Been doing a bit of research, and many are blaming the “fast charger” for the short battery cycle. For what it’s worth, I’m now draining and charging my batteries with a standard charger to see if it helps with the problem. 04/04/2017 Guto M Reply What do SAMSUNG says about this F…ink issue ? Or they just tell something when battery starts to explode in customers’ faces ??? Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Thinkstock More like this Triple your privacy with a Chromebook and two VPNs 14 eyebrow-raising things Google knows about you Defensive Computing for email attachments Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing Modern browsers offer an increased privacy option that goes by a number of different names: Incognito Mode in Chrome, Private Browsing in Firefox and Opera, InPrivate Browsing in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, and Private Window in Safari. Since all of these do more or less the same thing, so I’ll just use Chrome’s “Incognito Mode” moniker as shorthand to refer to all of them. When you open an incognito window in Chrome, the most popular browser choice, there is a description that explains the limits of what is protected from prying eyes. Judging from a number of conversations I’ve had, this description is often ignored. A surprisingly high percentage of people mistakenly think that going incognito hides their activity from all prying eyes. As Google’s description of incognito mode makes clear, this is not the case: “Pages you view in incognito tabs won’t stick around in your browser’s history, cookie store, or search history after you’ve closed all of your incognito tabs. Any files you download or bookmarks you create will be kept. However, you aren’t invisible. Going incognito doesn’t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the websites you visit.” There are two types of privacy to consider: local privacy and online privacy. Only your local privacy, what people can see on the computer where your browsing takes place, is effected by switching to incognito mode. Your online privacy is not impacted in any way. Basically, incognito mode just means that the browser doesn't save cookies, temporary internet files or your browsing history when you are in incognito mode. The main thing it does is hide your browsing history from other people who use the same computer. Not all of reasons someone might want to do this are nefarious; I used incognito mode when I was shopping for Christmas presents on a shared computer this past year, and successfully managed to keep the gifts I searched for and purchased a secret. There are other uses for incognito mode apart from keeping your browsing history secure from prying eyes. For example, you can be logged into your main Google account, then open an Incognito Window and use it log into a separate or secondary Google account at the same time. The same is true for other accounts that you might not want tracking your every online move, such as Facebook.  Many users have a mistaken understanding about the limits of what incognito mode can do. Despite the clear warnings offered when opening an incognito tab, some still think that it hides their online activity from everyone, including their ISP or employer, when this is obviously not the case. Perhaps it is the “spy in a fedora” icon that Google uses for incognito mode leads some to this mistaken conclusion, but it does absolutely nothing to keep your ISP or employer from seeing exactly what you are doing online, and this mistake could potentially lead to some embarrassing conversations at the office. In addition, software that is installed on your computer can also circumvent the privacy protections of going incognito. Parental monitoring software is generally unaffected by incognito mode, for example. Spyware that is installed on a computer may also continue to collect information despite the use of incognito mode.  Incognito mode and other private browsing modes are useful and they do provide a real level of local privacy protection that is easy to take advantage of. As long as users are aware of the limitations and do not expect a magic bullet that completely hides their online activity, it can be a useful tool that is simple to use. But if you want real online privacy, you are going to have take some extra steps.  This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Today, Google confirmed that it will be making some changes to those tools, including ending support for its iOS SDK. See also: Best racing games for Android 1 week ago In a blog post, Google said it ended support for adding new iOS accounts to Google Play Game Services in December, due to what the company claims was the low use of those tools on Apple’s mobile operating system. Going forward, it will no longer update or support the iOS SDK, nor will its native SDK release support any integration with iOS. It appears that game developers can still add web support for any games made with Google Play Game Services, along with Android of course, but the removal of iOS support means the tools are not quite as “cross-platform” as once advertised. In addition, Google claims that after examining data from games made with the tools, developers apparently don’t use the Gifts, Requests, and Quests features in Google Play Game Services as much as others. Therefore, the company has decided to slowly end support for these features. It will officially deactivate them after March 31, 2018, which should give any game developers who use Gifts, Requests, and Quests in their titles plenty of time to remove them. Games that used the Gifts feature allowed gamers to send in-game items to friends, while Requests allowed gamers to ask others to send them in-game Gifts. The Quests feature let game developers create new time-based objectives for players in their games without making them download an update. Google Play Game Services will continue to support features like achievements, leaderboards, multiplayer and sign-in for game titles. Even with these changes, Google says it is “working hard on future GPGS updates” and that it remains committed to offering game developers “high quality services”. Hopefully we will learn more about the company’s plans for game development and tool updates in May as part of its the 2017 Google I/O conference.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Roger Siegenthaler You do know what frand is... the point of frand is so standardised systems can't be abused by the patent holders (Qualcomm)... There's nothing that apple does that should be standardised and therefore nothing they could contribute to the frand pool. Drakenoid There actually are things Apple can contribute but they don't, like their processor tech. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Funem Microsoft make money on Android phone sales due to patents. In theory they have nothing to gain from joining as they would lose they money. Syukri Lajin they are trying to put their products into android phones. and getting in good term with android makers is the first step to this. they might be losing money for the patents, but they can offset it by putting their software and services into the phone,which is also better for long term profit. the bad news for us is that we'll get more bloatware. lol Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Gerardo Sarabia Did you even read my comment? First thing I said is I know it had nothing to do with Android/PAX. YuCMi That doesn't change the validity of the rest of my comment. The beginning of your second sentence confused me, which is why I did not pick up on you saying Waymo is unrelated. Still though, your comment was completely off topic from Pax. Infringing on patents can happen involuntarily, and are more of a case of copying or reproducing. What happened with Waymo is actual theft, breaches of legal contracts, and conspiracy, among other things. Gerardo Sarabia Yeah... who cares how it happened. Either you are copying or not. Either you are open about sharing those ideas so costumers benefit from competition, or you aren't. I understand the difference, don't get me wrong, but this has been the argument Google (now Alphabet) has been giving the media and users for a long time. Now that I think about it, it actually has a lot to do with PAX, big coincidence PAX is happening now that Google is making hardware, they need freedom around those patents more than ever, not for Android but for themselves. Basically Google can get away with entering iOS/Apple's market and even use Oracle's Java in order to do so, but Uber shouldn't? I understand the difference from stealing and copying but there's clearly some conflict on these ideals. Maybe Waymo should just sue the guy that stole those files instead of Uber if that's the problem. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross.

Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel. Drakenoid I would love Android Pay with MST!!! That would be dream come true! Also fast wireless charging!!! Though I am sure Samsung doesn't hold the patent for hybrid wireless those are held by the alliances.

Berners-Lee, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, is this year's recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing's version of the Nobel Prize. The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune thanks to Berners-Lee's efforts to make the internet more accessible and useful. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Inventor of World Wide Web wins computing's 'Nobel Prize' Last Modified: Tuesday, April 04, 2017 12:58 PM By Michael Liedtke / Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO-- Most people who search on Google, share on Facebook and shop on Amazon have never heard of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year's recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing's version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. "It's a crowning achievement," Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. "But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help." The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee's efforts to make the internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video — everything, really, beyond plain text — online. SPINNING THE WEB Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world's first website, http://info.cern.ch . Besides coming up with the web's technical specifications, Berners-Lee "offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole," said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he'd laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. CAUGHT IN THE WEB The web's widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the U.S. and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the web will become less accessible in the U.S. if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting "net neutrality." That's the principle that internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, "it's going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realize it's important," Berners-Lee said. "It allowed America to benefit from a thriving internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America." Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a "recurrent threat." He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn't have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is "really important to the future of society," he says. "As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person." BEYOND THE WEB Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn't sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. "Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so It's only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us," Berners-Lee said. "So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences." This is the 50th anniversary of the A.M. Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany's codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | April 4, 2017 -- 17:00 GMT (10:00 PDT) | Topic: Networking Google on Tuesday shared details of Espresso, the latest pillar of its software-defined networking (SDN) strategy. For more than 10 years, Google has been building its own network infrastructure to support new, effectively real-time services that span the globe. Espresso is the fourth part of its SDN strategy, extending its SDN approach to the peering edge of the network -- where different networks freely connect with each other. Espresso has been in production for more than two years and routes 20 percent of Google's total traffic to the internet, Google Fellow Amin Vahdat said in a blog post. "It is changing the way traffic is directed at the peering edge, delivering unprecedented scale, flexibility, and efficiency," he wrote. Vahdat said Espresso innovates in two key ways: First, rather than connecting a user to a static point based on their IP address (or the IP address of their DNS resolver), Espresso allows Google to dynamically choose from where to serve them. That allows Google to balance traffic based on actual performance data and to react in real-time to failures and congestion. Second, Espresso enables Google to separate the logic and control of traffic management from the confines of individual router "boxes." "Rather than relying on thousands of individual routers to manage and learn from packet streams, we push the functionality to a distributed system that extracts the aggregate information," Vahdat explained. Espresso builds on other layers of Google's SDN strategy, which include Jupiter, a datacenter interconnect, and Andromeda, a Network Function Virtualization stack. Google views network as a critical part of infrastructure, Vahdat wrote. "Our network continues to be a key opportunity and differentiator for Google, ensuring that Google Cloud services and customers enjoy the same levels of availability, performance, and efficiency available to 'Google native' services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail and more," he said.

The surveyors had the teens grade the companies on a 1-through-10 “coolness” scale. They also tracked how “aware” the kids were of all 122 brands — which ones they'd heard of and which ones they hadn't. The folks at Google crunched these numbers and put them all in a glossy scatterplot that tells us two things at once: the brands teens know, and the ones they think are cool. That chart's below. The labels are tiny, but I'll walk you through the high and low points. (And you can always open up Google's original report and poke around yourself.) Google/YouGov The No. 1 coolest brand in America? YouTube, according to the teens. Netflix comes in second place, and Google comes in third. And most other brands aren't even close. Now if you're somewhat skeptical about a Google-commissioned survey showing Google and YouTube — which Google acquired in 2006 — in the top tier of teen coolness, you should be. Neither Google nor YouGov responded to requests to share the topline questionnaire of the survey. The question wording would help us see if anyone is putting their thumb on the methodological scales, so to speak. So some gain-of-salt-taking is warranted here, particularly with respect to the Google products that appear in Google's chart. On the other hand, most of the interesting findings concern all the non-Google brands. Like Oreos, which teens rank the coolest non-tech company. “Teens go crazy for Oreos!” the report's authors write. “Oreos are cool because of the variety of delicious flavors and the cute/funny marketing.” Noted. The only other non-tech brands to crack the top 10: Nike and Doritos. Moving away from the top of the chart, the rankings let you draw all sorts of neat coolness comparisons between the brands you love and/or hate. Dominos is cooler than Pizza Hut. Coke is cooler than Pepsi, but neither is as cool as Gatorade. The Facebook Messenger app is less cool than Facebook itself. (As one perceptive Twitter user put it yesterday, “Idk why Facebook messenger is considered less cool than Facebook and I also don't know why I agree.") You want more cool? Axe Body Spray is cooler than Sunglass Hut. Sunglass Hut is cooler than JC Penney. JC Penney is just a hair cooler than Red Bull (ouch). Every single company is cooler than gonzo journalism outlet Vice (double ouch), with one exception: the Wall Street Journal, which teens rated the least-cool brand of all. “Well kids,” retorted WSJ reporter Mike Bird, “the bond market doesn't think you're cool either.” The Washington Post was not included in the report , presumably because it's so cool it would have broken the chart's x-axis. The report also included a throwaway section on which brands millennials think are cool, but nobody cares about them because millennials have not been cool for at least several years now. Fun fact: The oldest millennials (born 1980) will be eligible for AARP membership (age 50) in approximately 13 years. “Gen Z believe and rely on brands to shape their world,” the report concludes. “As professionals, we should see this as our challenge—to live up to the standard Gen Z has set for us and to continue to inform, inspire, and create products and marketing that facilitate the world in which they want to live.” Like Oreos, apparently. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address.

They include: • Retrofit Kits for Existing Fleets • Autonomous Trucks • Automated Last Mile Delivery Services • Platooning and Guided Highways It should be noted that autonomous does not necessarily mean “driverless.” There’s a difference between eliminating human error and removing humans from truck cabs. The technologies outlined below may not displace the truck driver in all situations. However, they do change the discussion around hours of service and the role the driver plays in operating the vehicle. With that in mind, here is an overview of these technologies. Retrofit kits for existing fleets Otto, a U.S. start-up owned by Uber, that has ex-Google, Apple and Tesla employees working for it, has developed a kit that can equip existing trucks on the road. “We are developing a suite of sensors, software and truck enhancements coming together in a product that can be quickly outfitted on existing trucks,” Otto co-founders Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, wrote in a blog post. Otto said that it is testing the technology on highways and it recently completed an autonomous demo on a public highway. Otto envisions drivers that can put their trucks in “cruising” mode, as they call it, and technically go off duty, getting some sleep in the berth behind the driver’s seat; the truck could drive itself for hours—with the driver still collecting the usual rate per mile. But for now, drivers are still needed — not only to oversee the driving, but for all the things that happen either side of onramps and off-ramps, like the city driving and logistics, the docking and parking and weighing and so forth. These trucks would be automated but not “driverless.” Uber plans to develop an app, similar to their taxi app, to facilitate the communication between companies with capacity and shippers with freight to move. Autonomous trucks Semi-automated Self Driving Trucks (“saSDTs”) are those capable of automated driving under supervision and under limited circumstances like driving long distances on an interstate. Fully automated Self Driving Trucks (“faSDTs”) are those that can leave the truck terminal and travel to a destination without human intervention or presence in the truck cab. While some manufacturers may start with semi-automated vehicles, it is likely that all truck manufacturers will try to move as quickly as they can towards saSDTs/faSDTs. There are a host of companies testing technologies in this space. They include Daimler, Volvo, Tesla, Volkswagen, and Google’s Waymo division. Embark, a startup based in San Mateo, California, recently featured in Transport Topics, is working to build self-driving technology that would allow trucks to run on highways with no human input. CEO and co-founder Alex Rodrigues said Embark’s goal is not simply to assist drivers, but to enable completely unmanned trucks to travel on highways, from exit to exit, while continuing to rely on humans for city driving. Embark’s system uses onboard radar, cameras and lidar sensors in conjunction with military-grade GPS to monitor the truck’s environment and track its position. Self-driving software processes that information using a form of artificial intelligence that allows the truck to learn from its own experience, the company said. Embark’s vision for driverless trucks differs from the technology concepts espoused by truck manufacturers, which have been demonstrating driver-assist technologies that help rather than replace the human operator. Automated last mile delivery services Some companies are looking at incorporating last-mile solutions into the automated shipping industry by literally bringing items to your door: Google just patented a concept for a driverless truck that delivers items to your door, and a company called Starpoint developed a scooter-sized delivery bot, theoretically deployed from a smart truck, that rides down the sidewalk to deliver your packages. Platooning and guided highways One approach being examined is “platooning” that would enable a number of trucks to travel along a highway together, all controlled by the first vehicle. It requires development of a new technology called “lane-keeping” that is under development. The challenge at this point comes when the lead truck needs to change lanes on the highway. The trucks following behind must then have drivers fully engaged to perform the lane change. Silicon Valley firm Peloton Technologies has developed advanced platooning software, which lets trucks “link” up in lines while on the highway. Today, almost all commercial cargo moving less than 500 miles is transported by truck. Cargo trucks share public roads with private vehicles. The volume of cargo traffic and private vehicle traffic in many areas has grown faster than the public road infrastructure. Truck traffic over congested public roads contributes to major economic challenges for businesses and cost to the taxpayer. The Freight Shuttle System (FSS) concept was initiated at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute for the purposes of finding a low-emissions alternative to moving freight and relieving congestion created by trucks in heavy freight corridors. FSS moves truck trailers up to 53 ft., domestic intermodal containers up to 53 ft., and all sizes of ocean shipping containers via emissions-free, electric-powered transporters on elevated guideways in the medians of highways or other rights-of-way over distances of up to 500 miles. It has been designed to integrate into today’s intermodal network. The Freight Shuttle System is currently focusing on high volume locations, such as the I-35 corridor in Texas. They are working on cross-border projects in El Paso and Laredo. These shuttles can be operated 24/7 without drivers. Clearly autonomous trucks is a very “hot” area with great potential for saving truckers billions of dollars in operating expenses in the years ahead as these technologies gain adoption.  As we can see, there are a number of technologies and servcies that are being developed to address these opportunities.

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: April 4, 2017 11:56 am Follow @AuroraSentinel SAN FRANCISCO | Most people who search on Google, share on Facebook and shop on Amazon have never heard of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year’s recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing’s version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. In this Monday, April 3, 2017, photo, Tim Berners-Lee poses outside his office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) In this Monday, April 3, 2017, photo, Tim Berners-Lee poses outside his office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. Berners-Lee, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, is this year's recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing's version of the Nobel Prize. The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune thanks to Berners-Lee's efforts to make the internet more accessible and useful. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) “It’s a crowning achievement,” Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help.” The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee’s efforts to make the internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video — everything, really, beyond plain text — online. SPINNING THE WEB Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world’s first website, http://info.cern.ch . Besides coming up with the web’s technical specifications, Berners-Lee “offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole,” said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he’d laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. CAUGHT IN THE WEB The web’s widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the U.S. and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the web will become less accessible in the U.S. if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting “net neutrality.” That’s the principle that internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, “it’s going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realize it’s important,” Berners-Lee said. “It allowed America to benefit from a thriving internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America.” Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a “recurrent threat.” He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn’t have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is “really important to the future of society,” he says. “As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person.” BEYOND THE WEB Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn’t sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. “Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so It’s only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us,” Berners-Lee said. “So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences.” This is the 50th anniversary of the A.M. Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany’s codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web.

Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 05 April, 2017 03:00 - - - - print email Comments Google is working to accelerate the performance of its applications over the internet by building out a software-defined network at broad scale. On Tuesday, the company announced Espresso, a system that provides increased network performance to users of the company’s applications. It works by applying software-defined networking to the edge of the tech titan’s network, where Google connects to the peer networks of other internet service providers. Rather than rely on individual routers to figure out the best way to direct internet traffic, Espresso hands that responsibility off to servers running in the data centers Google operates at the edge of its network. Espresso aggregates all the data about network performance from across its peering points and uses that to dynamically direct traffic to users. That allows Google to offer major performance improvements, instead of sending users information from a static point based on their IP addresses or the addresses of their DNS resolvers. “And we’ve actually pulled the brains of the routing protocol out of individual routers,” Google Fellow Amin Vahdat said. “So we no longer have all of the functionality residing on high-end routers, we actually can leverage more commodity devices, more commodity network elements, and push all of the functionality out of the router boxes onto our server banks.” Espresso is the fourth major software-defined network project Google has announced publicly. It builds on the company’s Jupiter data center interconnect project, Andromeda network function virtualization stack, and B4, a globally deployed software-defined wide area network. The system has been running in production at Google for longer than two years, and it currently handles about 20 percent of the company’s traffic. The company’s legacy networking infrastructure handles the other 80 percent, but all new capacity uses Espresso. Vahdat didn’t provide an exact timetable for when Espresso would handle all of the company’s traffic, but said the transition is “moving quickly.” Google is touting the performance benefits of Espresso not just for its consumer customers, but for the companies that choose it to provide cloud services. Companies transferring information between their on-premises data centers and Google Cloud Platform will see improved performance as a result of Espresso, Vahdat said. In addition, they will benefit from Google’s networking investments when serving information from the company’s cloud over the public internet, he said. Google handles roughly a quarter of the world’s internet traffic and has touted that expertise as a key part of its value to customers, compared to companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry The pros and cons of an Android-powered world: Leonid Bershidsky The pros and cons of an Android-powered world: Leonid Bershidsky There is no comparable number for Apple, but Android has a certain business model advantage: Part of the revenue comes from Google's main business -- ads shown to users in the Google apps that come with Android. By: Bloomberg | Published: April 4, 2017 10:53 PM This year, Android is donning the crown of the world’s No. 1 operating system, both in terms of the number of devices that use it and the revenue its ecosystem generates. (Reuters) This year, Android is donning the crown of the world’s No. 1 operating system, both in terms of the number of devices that use it and the revenue its ecosystem generates. As an Android user, I don’t really mind — but there are ominous aspects to its growing dominance and a possibility that better technology may not get the recognition it deserves. StatCounter, the web analytics company, reports that Android devices accounted for 37.93 percent of global internet traffic, just ahead of Windows’ 37.91 percent. That’s remarkable, considering that most people use some version of Windows on computers at work. Given the mobile operating system’s momentum as people spend more time on their phones, the scale will soon tip further in Android’s favor. On the revenue side, Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, has long been the dominant moneymaker. AppAnnie, a firm that keeps tabs on the app economy, predicts, however, that it will be displaced by Android this year. While Apple’s App Store will still collect almost twice as much revenue as the Google Play store, owned by Google’s parent Alphabet Inc., third-party Android app stores will make sure that the Google operating system tops iOS. Alphabet doesn’t say how much it’s making from Android, nor does Apple break out the App Store in its financial reports. Last year, Oracle, which sued Google for copyright infringement, disclosed a number in court: It claimed the Android revenue reached $33 billion between 2008 and 2015. There is no comparable number for Apple, but Android has a certain business model advantage: Part of the revenue comes from Google’s main business — ads shown to users in the Google apps that come with Android. That revenue stream, which Apple doesn’t have, may well compensate for Alphabet’s lack of control over the third-party stores. Also Watch: Android is the ugly duckling of the operating-system world. It’s technically open-source and free to use, so device makers like to tweak it. That creates chaos and often lowers the quality of the user experience, which advanced users try to fix by messing with the system themselves. Because of the variety of Android flavors and hardware on which the system runs, updates are intermittent for most users — those who don’t own a Google-branded or co-branded device. Though the general interface design has approved in recent years, it can sometimes feel raw and less convenient than that of Apple’s sleek iOS. Many, including myself, like Android because it can be an exciting set of building blocks for a little boy (or girl). That it’s winning the operating system race is exciting to those who, like me, have argued that the open-source approach is the most progressive. Besides, Alphabet’s push to turn phones into virtual reality devices is an interesting vision for the future of a gadget that’s getting harder and harder to improve. But Android’s emerging dominance is also worrying for two reasons. One is privacy. The reason Android is free is that Google, Alphabet’s main unit, is an advertising company that collects lots of data about users. Given the erosion of privacy protections, I’m not sure Google is the platform on which I’d like to do most of my personal computing. The other problem with Android’s ascendancy is that it’s not a good operating system for desktops and laptops. The three major operating-system makers — Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft — have chosen distinct approaches to handling different kinds of devices. Apple creates a separate system for every device category — the MacOS for laptops and desktops, the iOS for phones and tablets, and separate systems for wearables and set-top boxes. Also Watch: Alphabet is trying to make a mobile system usable on devices equipped with a hardware keyboard. Android apps run on Chromebooks, and Samsung’s latest Galaxy S8 smartphone can be turned into a desktop machine by using a special dock. But many of the apps run in phone size in the middle of a big screen, and many desktop apps to which Windows and Mac users are accustomed are not available for Android. It’s an irritating compromise. Microsoft has the most promising approach: It’s trying to port its desktop operating system to mobile devices. That its Surface laptop-tablet hybrids run the full version of Windows is a major competitive advantage over competing products using iOS and Android. Microsoft has also tweaked Windows so that it can now run on ARM processors, the architecture used in mobile devices. This appears to be the most promising approach to the seamless use of the same apps across various devices. But Microsoft has botched its smartphone project so badly that even selling phones with the full version of Windows — which will truly turn the pocket device into a scalable computer — would probably be an uphill battle. If Android’s dominance keeps growing and Microsoft cannot sell the public on its superior vision, that will mean a victory for suboptimal technology, something I, for one, would be sorry to see. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Former Google SVP of HR and Best-Selling Author Laszlo Bock to Deliver Keynote at 20th Annual HR Technology Conference and Exposition(R) /EINPresswire.com/ — HORSHAM, PA–(Marketwired – Apr 4, 2017) – Human Resource Executive® magazine, the premier publication focused on strategic issues in HR, today announced that Laszlo Bock, a New York Times best-selling author and former Senior Vice President of People Operations at Google, will deliver the opening keynote presentation at the 20th Annual HR Technology Conference & Exposition®. The conference, which is widely regarded as the HR show to attend for anyone in the industry, will be held at The Venetian® Las Vegas from Tuesday, October 10 through Friday, October 13, 2017. „The term ‚innovation’ has become the business word du jour, but few organizations truly understand what it takes to achieve a culture of innovation — and fewer still recognize the role that HR can and should play in paving the way for that culture,” said HR Technology Conference co-chair Steve Boese. „With his groundbreaking work in areas such as people analytics — where he applied academic-quality rigor and Google-paced innovation to people management — Laszlo literally wrote the book on how to unlock organizational performance and innovation through people practices. We are excited to welcome him as the opening keynote presenter at this year’s HR Technology Conference and know that our attendees will gain invaluable insight into how to transform their companies through innovation from his session.” While many believe they have the secret to innovation — establishing aspirational, „moonshot” goals, investing in secret skunkworks facilities, or using design thinking — Bock recognizes that there is no single path to innovation and creativity. Different situations, teams and problems all require different approaches. In his keynote, „From Moonshots to Roofshots: What Everyone Gets Wrong About Innovation and How to Get It Right,” Bock promises to bust the myths and misconceptions surrounding innovation. Drawing on his experience throughout Google’s long history of innovation, he also will outline how HR and HR IT leaders can play a critical role in creating organizations that are built to innovate. HR Technology Conference attendees will learn about the specific skills and tools these leaders need to enable employees to embrace an innovative mindset and turn innovation into reality for their organization. „When it comes to innovation, it’s easy to focus on crazy, ambitious goals. But that’s not the only way. More often than not, success hinges on steady, incremental advances. Even more deeply, innovation is rooted in the kind of environment and culture you create,” Bock said. „I look forward to sharing with HR Technology Conference attendees my ideas about the ways for HR professionals to establish and foster innovative cultures within their companies.” Well known for leading Google’s people function as the company grew from 6,000 to 75,000 employees, Bock also is the best-selling author of the book, „WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead.” The informative book has been published in more than 20 languages and earned numerous honors, including being named as one of the best business books of the year by The Economist and one of the top 10 books on creative leadership by Forbes. As a highly sought-after strategic advisor, Bock has partnered with founders and leadership teams to help them scale, lead and build amazing cultures during times of hyper-growth. Prior to joining Google in 2006, Bock held various executive leadership roles within GE Capital, including serving as the company’s vice president of human resources. While he was a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, he collaborated with clients in the technology, private equity and media industries on a variety of strategic and operational issues. Bock also is a fellow of the National Academy of Human Resources and currently serves on the Aspen Institute’s National Commission for Social, Emotional, and Academic Learning. He was named „HR Executive of the Year” in 2010, followed by receiving an „HR Professional of the Decade” designation in 2015. For years, the HR Technology Conference has been the must-attend event for HR professionals around the world, thanks to the high-caliber educational opportunities it provides. The addition of Bock’s keynote presentation on innovation indicates the event’s single-minded dedication to ensuring attendees have the information and tools they need to be successful in their roles. Registration is now open for the 20th Annual HR Technology Conference & Exposition®. Additional information, including Super Saver registration details, is available at www.HRTechConference.com or by calling toll-free 1-800-727-1227.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google is updating your login experience starting April By John Hoff - April 4, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Most of us log in to our Google accounts – whether on our Android phones or on a browser on your PC – without even giving the login experience a second thought. So props to Google for doing the thinking for us, whether it be about a streamlined login experience or the security that goes with it. Starting this month, we will start to see some changes in the way we log in to Google. Starting April 5, Google will make all browser sign-in flows consistent across computers, phones and tablets. This is so you get used to one sing-in flow, even across platforms. To be specific, this streamlining will affect mobile browsers on Android (and iOS), web browsers (Chrome, Firefox and other modern browsers), and even Google and 3rd-party applications on iOS. Apart from the look and feel, Google is also making some changes in the process. One new change is that only non-standard permission requests will be presented in the consent screen in your application when you try to log in, where usually these are displayed all together. Now, select your account to log in, a user consents to core permissions. The secondary consent screen will appear only if additional permissions are requested by the application. Also for security reasons, users will now see more visibly exactly what app or service they are logging to. The application or service name will now be more visible to users, and they can click-through to get the contact information of said app. Google is reminding developers of 3rd party apps that require a Google login account to make sure that their apps will support this new way of logging in to Google.

The Chocolate Factory said that Espresso functions as the edge-facing component of the Google network, linking its own machines up with the interconnect facilities of backbone providers and ISPs. "Espresso extends our approach all the way to the peering edge of our network, the point where Google connects to other networks across the planet," explained Google fellow Amin Vahdat, principal engineer Ankur Jain, distinguished engineer Bikash Koley, and principal engineer Mahesh Kallahalla. "Google has one of the largest peering surfaces in the world, exchanging information with Internet Service. However, we found that existing Internet protocols could not manage our traffic to deliver the best availability and user experience to our users across the planet." Espresso is the latest release to come through the pipeline Google has built between the operation it uses to run its search and web services and the Google Cloud computing system. Like the Jupiter and Andromeda services, Espresso will be adapted from in-house technology to a public-facing commercial product on Cloud. In this case, Google hopes that integrating the in-house networking architecture will allow Cloud to be able to offer improved performance and uptime by getting faster, more consistent links between customers and their VMs. "This means we can often react to internet routing failures faster than internet routing protocols – which translates into higher availability of network services hosted on Google Cloud," explained the team. "Unique to Google Cloud, this means that our customers' traffic can be routed around outages, whereas our competitors' will not." The update comes as Google continues to pitch Cloud on the close ties it enjoys with the Chocolate Factory's other hosted offerings. At last month's Google Cloud Next summit, execs talked up integration with services such as AdWords and G-Suite as possible lures for companies to move to Google-branded clouds. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Rackspace launches cloud consultancy service while firing staff Services, services, services! 5 Comments Oracle refuses to let Java copyright battle die – another appeal filed in war against Google If at first you don't succeed, try { try { again } } 64 Comments There's gold in them thar hills!

The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune thanks to Berners-Lee’s efforts to make the internet more accessible and useful. (Charles Krupa/AP) By Michael Liedtke, Associated Press | Associated Press April 4, 2017 at 9:21 am SAN FRANCISCO — Most people who search on Google, share on Facebook and shop on Amazon have never heard of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year’s recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing’s version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. “It’s a crowning achievement,” Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help.” The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee’s efforts to make the internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video — everything, really, beyond plain text — online. SPINNING THE WEB Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world’s first website, http://info.cern.ch . Besides coming up with the web’s technical specifications, Berners-Lee “offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole,” said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he’d laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. CAUGHT IN THE WEB The web’s widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the U.S. and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the web will become less accessible in the U.S. if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting “net neutrality.” That’s the principle that internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, “it’s going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realize it’s important,” Berners-Lee said. “It allowed America to benefit from a thriving internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America.” Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a “recurrent threat.” He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn’t have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is “really important to the future of society,” he says. “As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person.” BEYOND THE WEB Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn’t sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. “Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so It’s only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us,” Berners-Lee said. “So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences.” This is the 50th anniversary of the A.M. Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany’s codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web.

Espresso is a Software-Defined Networking stack that speeds up Google’s services for its end users as the company’s network hands traffic off to third-party internet service providers who take it the last mile. While the company has customized nearly all components of its network, from data centers and servers to networking switches and software that orchestrates all this infrastructure, it does not control the infrastructure of ISPs that actually deliver its services to their consumers. For that, Google (like all other internet companies) has to peer with ISPs in data centers in various metros around the world. Interconnecting with ISPs in 70 metros and generating 25 percent of all internet traffic, the company says its network’s peering surface is one of the largest in the world. Those peering points represent the edge of Google’s network. “We found that existing internet protocols cannot use all of the connectivity options offered by our ISP partners, and therefore aren’t able to deliver the best availability and user experience to our end users,” Amin Vahdat, Google Fellow, and Bikash Koley, a distinguished engineer at the company, wrote in a blog post. Vahdat revealed the new architecture at the Open Networking Summit in Santa Clara, California, Tuesday. Espresso is the fourth pillar of Google’s SDN strategy, the other ones being the company’s data center interconnect called Jupiter, its software-defined WAN called B4, and Andromeda, its network virtualization stack. Of the four, Espresso was the most challenging one, the engineers wrote. It improves user experience in two ways. The first is automatic selection of the best data center location to serve a particular user from, based on real-time performance measurements. “Rather than pick a static point to connect users simply based on their IP address (or worse, the IP address of their DNS resolver), we dynamically choose the best point and rebalance our traffic based on actual performance data. Similarly, we are able to react in real-time to failures and congestion both within our network and in the public internet,” Vahdat and Koley wrote. The second is separation of logic and control of traffic from individual hardware routers. A single distributed system aggregates network information and makes routing decisions rather than relying on thousands of individual routers to manage packet streams. “We leverage our large-scale computing infrastructure and signals from the application itself to learn how individual flows are performing, as determined by the end user’s perception of quality.” Chart courtesy of Google Previous Article The Promise of Software Defined Storage: From Scalability to Efficiency Next Article VMware Sells Off Cloud Services Business to OVH Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

An example: Google is seeking to patent an advanced data center cooling system that provides precision cooling inside racks of servers, automatically adjusting to temperature changes while dramatically reducing the energy required to run chillers. The cooling design, which could help Google slash the power bill for its servers, reinforces Google's focus on its data centers as a competitive advantage in its battle with Microsoft and other rivals for leadership in cloud computing.

Name: Subject: Message: There appears to be a problem with Google Play Music and random stops Newsby Scott Adam Gordon14 hours ago 18 86 44 A longstanding Google Play Music problem has risen again. Reddit members and Google product forum-goers are reporting that Google Play Music stops playing, seemingly at random, on a range of devices. The resurgence of the issue, which was first added to the Google Product forums last July, may be linked to a recent update: there are many Google Pixel owners who are now reporting the problem, and the same issue appears to occur when using Google Play Music with Google Home (which is also yet to be resolved). However, the original problem — first identified with the Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo on Marshmallow — and that relating mostly to Google products from the last few weeks may not even be one and the same thing. Yet the comments in its Google product thread are still mounting up. See also: Google details malware that turned Android phones into powerful espionage tools 20 hours ago Given the length of time this issue has been ongoing for, and the number of responses it has received, it seems odd that Google hasn’t addressed it — or even offer some kind of explanation for it.

What Lenovo’s Motorola crew have done is to design a device that does exactly what its originator intended for the series. Like the Moto G, the Moto G5 Plus is delivered with highly acceptable hardware and software for an extremely reasonable price. Plus it has the same image sensor as one of the very best smartphone cameras ever released. Hardware Design As it is with all non-rugged smartphones, so too is it true of the Moto G5: if it looks good on the outside, a lot can be forgiven about the inside. I did not expect this smartphone to be as quick as a Google Pixel – and it’s not. I did not expect the display to look quite as brilliant as the Samsung Galaxy S8 or LG G6 – and it’s not. Instead, this is a smartphone whose development cost went majorly into the design of its exterior. Without looking excessively like any previous smartphone (outside of the Moto Z,) the Moto G5 Plus proves that Motorola’s hardware game is once again on-point. Moto G5 Plus : what no other phone has The industrial design of the Moto G5 Plus is miles ahead of what was released in the Moto G4 from the year 2016. The 2015 G smartphone Moto G (3rd Gen, that is) looked rather similar to its predecessor, the Moto G 2014 and the original, the first Moto G from 2013. The original Moto G was the best-looking industrial design of the bunch, if you ask me. The original Moto G would be all but unusable today, what with its low-resolution display, older connectivity, and processor that’s not quite adequate for today’s apps. But the device still feels good to hold and remains a beautiful part of tech history. Fast forward to 2017 and Motorola is back in the driver’s seat with hitting that fine balance between cost and fine design. The display on the Moto G5 Plus is extremely good – again, not as bright or as sharp as the LG G6, but highly decent. This display is more than merely usable – it’s amongst the best 1080p displays on a smartphone today. Software and Apps (and how less is more) Inside this device is Android 7.0 Nougat, Motorola’s ever-so-slight modified version of the most basic new Android. Motorola has been so kind as to tow the line, offering what amounts to the most vanilla version of Android outside of a Google Pixel phone sans its Pixel launcher. If Google still sold a Nexus smartphone, it’d be a more pure Android – but they don’t currently sell any Nexus, only Pixel. As such, it’s almost as if Motorola saw the opportunity to be the manufacturer that sells the least expensive basic Android phone on the market. Motorola’s modifications are all non-intrusive – and in most cases, a welcome addition to Android. Most are included in their full set of gestures – some new, some that’ve been around for several generations of Moto phone. Included with the gestures is a set of swipes that can be used with the device’s fingerprint scanner. That’s the pill-shaped indentation under the display – not a button, but a scanner. The power button and the volume button both still reside on the right side of the phone. In short – it’s GOOD that Motorola has included only the bare essentials with this smartphone in apps. They’ve got their own app to control gestures and their own notifications display, a Motorola-made camera app, FM Radio, and a very basic Q&A app called Device Help – but that’s it. They’ve allowed the consumer to be trusted finding their own apps if they do so require them. Google provides the following: Calculator, Calendar, Chrome, Clock, Contacts, Devices, Downloads, Drive, Duo, Gmail, Google (search), Maps, Messenger, Phone, Photos, Play Movies, Play Music, Play Store, Voice Search, and YouTube. This is about as basic as a collection of Google apps gets on a Google-certified Android smartphone. More apps can be downloaded from Google Play as the user wishes. Camera The quality of the camera on this device is well above what the price might make most expect. Surprisingly good color can be captured – even in low light – and with this build the entire photography experience just feels a lot better than it did last year with the G4 Plus. Have a peek at the specifications for the camera on the back of this years Moto G5 Plus below. Moto G5 Plus Back-facing Camera Specs: • 12MP CMOS sensor with 1.4µm pixel size • Dual Pixel autofocus • F1.7 aperture • 8x Digital Zoom • On-sensor phase detection • 1080p video • Dual-LED Flash • Sony IMX362 Exmor RS Image Sensor The Moto G5 Plus uses the same Sony Exmor RS image processor as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Because of this, I expected exceptional image quality from this smartphone. I expected to be able to capture fine-looking photos in whatever environment (dark, light, odd included). For a $300 smartphone, the photos I can capture with the Moto G5 Plus are fantastic. The photos are great for a more expensive smartphone, too. The Galaxy S7 still costs $600 USD – at least – and has the same image sensor inside. To be clear, we have not tested the non-Plus Moto G5 – that has a different image sensor inside. That smartphone costs around $100 less than the Plus, and we’re not going to assume it has just as high a quality camera without giving it a close once-over. For now, we’re giving a couple of big thumbs-up to the camera setup on the Moto G5 Plus. Battery Life As we’re familiar with all the gear inside the Moto G5 Plus – processor, manufacturer, software – there was no reason to expect anything less than the best from the battery. Battery life has turned out to be top-notch, lasting at least a full day with mobile data and a relatively intense amount of work being done. Streaming videos with a full-brightness display will result in considerably less uptime, but this phone has QuickCharge abilities, so a charge back up to 100% won’t take a large amount of time. Wrap-up Because this smartphone looks rather nice, feels good to use (metal!), and takes decent photos, it’s a good phone. For the price it’s being offered at, the Moto G5 Plus is more than a good phone, it’s a great phone. Lenovo’s Motorola has hit the right speed with this device, its price, and its presentation. The Moto G5 Plus was made available for sale on the 31st of March, 2017, at a variety of dealers both on and offline. Through NewEgg, Republic Wireless, Frys, Flash Wireless, B&H, Costco, Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Ting, Walmart, and Motorola dot com, this device was made available off-contract. The phone was available for $229 with 2GB RAM and 32GB internal storage or $299 with 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. This device was also made available through Amazon Prime as a Prime Exclusive Phone. With that system, Amazon Prime members were able to get the device with 2GB RAM/32GB for $184.99 for Prime members, and 4GB RAM/64GB for $239.99 for Prime members. With that price comes an Amazon experience – apps, primarily – and not the same software experience as we’ve reviewed here.

Map Maker was supposed to let users correct missing details and fix broken map segments. In practice, it was often abused. Google previously announced its intention to close Map Maker back in November 2016. It is replacing the feature by putting more emphasis on its Local Guides program, a scheme designed to reward regional power users who improve business details on Google Maps. Local Guides will now also be credited for contributing suggestions to the core map layer. Map Maker included a fairly robust selection of editing tools that allowed anyone to add and edit places to the map. New road segments could also be created and amended, allowing you to perfect your local area if you noticed a mistake in the automatically generated map. Map Maker encouraged users to review each other's edits in a process designed to reduce the number of fraudulent additions. The service was far from perfect though. Millions of moderations were made over the years but still some community members managed to circumvent the protections. One of the most high-profile attacks added a message mocking Google's content review policies to a region in Pakistan. It was accompanied by a giant Android figure urinating on an Apple logo. After allowing several similarly dubious edits to be made by the same user, Google was forced to temporarily withdraw Map Maker while it reviewed the incident. Map Maker has also had extremely positive effects. Users have crowdsourced maps for remote regions where previously there were none. In India, the tool was widely used to build map imagery for local areas that hadn't been included in Google's base mapping scan. In its post announcing the end of support for Map Maker, Google reflected on the positive impact that Map Maker has had in these communities and others around the world. It noted that users can continue their work by registering as Local Guides and using the new tools available as part of the core Google Maps app. "Since 2008, the Google Map Maker community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience for users worldwide," said Google. "The Google Maps team took notice and, beginning with adding and editing places, started to bring Map Maker capabilities to our desktop and mobile products to make it easier for more users to keep their communities up to date while at home or on the go. These changes have empowered many more users to update the places they care about, view the status of their edits, and moderate other users’ edits." As of today, the Map Maker tool is no longer available. Its former website now redirects to a new Google support page explaining how to start editing maps from within the Maps app. The tools are only available to Local Guides with a rank of Level 3 or higher, helping to lower the volume of spam submissions to moderate.

As a result, it’s harder to actually get to Now, since the default action has been hijacked by Assistant. RELATED ARTICLE How to Customize Your Google Assistant Daily Briefing If you’re anything like me, however, you still use Google Now a lot. Fortunately, there are a handful of ways to easily get back to Now—all without interfering with Assistant. Let’s do this thing. Option One: Just Open the Google App Yeah, that’s it: the Google app that’s already installed on your phone is actually the same thing as Google Now—for all intents and purposes, they are one and the same. So open the app tray and find the Google App. Open it. Done. Option Two: Tell Assistant to Open the Google App This is admittedly a weird solution, but a solution nonetheless. When you long-press the home button to wake Asssistant, just say “Open the Google App.” Bam, the Google App, and by extension, Google Now, is there. Option Three: Use a Custom Action in Nova Launcher RELATED ARTICLE Create More Useful Shortcuts on Android’s Home Screen with Nova Launcher Gestures Since the Google Now Launcher is dying, that removes it from the list of recommended ways to easily access Google Now. Fortunately, you can easily set a custom action in Nova Launcher—our favorite Android launcher here at How-To Geek—to quickly and easily access Now directly from your home screen. Go ahead and open Nova’s Settings menu—you’ll find this in the app drawer. Form here, scroll down to Gestures & Inputs. To get a similar experience to the way things worked before Assistant (or in the Google Now Launcher), we’re going to change the top option: Home Button. Click that, which will open a set of options that can be assigned to the home button. Scroll down to Google Now and tap it. Now whenever you’re already on your home screens, a quick tap of the home button will open Now. Easy peasy. This one is easily my favorite solution, because it makes the most sense: it’s simple, intuitive, and just stays out of the way. Plus, you can still easily access Assistant by long-pressing the home button, so they don’t interfere with each other. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (2 REPLIES) Got Feedback?

Our helpful guide explains how to download YouTube to Android. Store your favourite YouTube videos on your Android phone or tablet to watch offline By Marie Brewis | 04 Apr 17 Watching YouTube video is one of our favourite pastimes on an Android phone or tablet, but doing so out of range of a Wi-Fi hotspot can place a heavy burden on a mobile data connection. Thankfully, you can use an app such as Tubemate to download YouTube video for offline watching. (Also see how to download YouTube to an iPad or iPhone, and how to download YouTube to a PC or laptop.) Because Google doesn't exactly approve of you bypassing its platform for watching video (also see is it legal to download YouTube video?), you won't find Tubemate in Google Play. Nevertheless, it's a free app that we will show you how to sideload on your phone or tablet. In publishing this tutorial we do not advocate the downloading of copyrighted videos from YouTube, and in our examples we are using only video from our own YouTube channel. Download YouTube video to Android with Tubemate • Open the Settings menu on your Android phone or tablet and go to Security, then enable Unknown sources. This will allow you to install apps from outside Google Play; that it is disabled by default is to protect you, so we recommend disabling that toggle once you have installed Tubemate • Now open your web browser and head to tubemate.net. You want to install the latest version of the app (currently 2.3) from one of the verified sites listed here. This is because in downloading apps from outside Google Play you risk potentially downloading something malicious that is masquerading as a genuine app • Also note that because you are sideloading the app it won't be automatically updated along with the other apps on your phone when a new version is released. So if Tubemate ever stops working for you, return here and install the update assuming one is available • We've chosen Android Freeware. Click on the link, then press the blue Install app button. You'll be warned that this type of file can harm your device, but go ahead and press OK anyway • Once the file has downloaded you'll see a notification in the drop-down bar at the top of the screen. Tap on this notification and your device should open the Downloads folder on your device • Tap on the download listed youtube-tubemate.7.07.apk and choose Install when prompted. Click Open when the download completes and agree to the T&Cs • You can either use Tubemate to download YouTube videos from directly within the app, or you can do so within the YouTube app itself. To download a video from the YouTube app, launch the video, then tap Share and choose Tubemate. You'll be prompted to choose a resolution, then tap the green download button • Alternatively, open the Tubemate app and use the search function to find a video. To download the video just press the green arrow at the top of the screen, choose a resolution and again tap the green download icon Read next: If YouTube wanted you to download YouTube videos for free it wouldn't have come up with YouTube Red.

The program can be tricked by humans with little technical knowledge by inserting individual frames into the videos, according to researchers at the University of Washington. They managed to convince Google's "cloud video intelligence" tool that a video about animals was about a car by flashing a frame of one every two seconds. The images are too quick to be seen by the human eye but were enough to fool the software into wrongly classifying the video. Watch | Sundar Pichai?s rise to fame in 90 seconds 01:33 The researchers said the technology's applications could include "detecting if a video contains child pornography, or terror and racial propaganda", as well as helping video hosting sites, such as YouTube, identify inappropriate content. While it is not the same program that Google's YouTube uses to police online videos, experts said the flaws raise fresh concerns over the ability of computers to  stay one step ahead of humans when it comes to policing extremist content. Some of the biggest brands in Britain and the United States have pulled millions of dollars in advertising from YouTube over concerns about it appearing next to terrorist material. This week Google said it would step up its use of artificial intelligence to flag extremist content. Companies that have withdrawn advertising from Google "We clearly showed their system is brittle," said Radha Poovendran, chair of the University of Washington's electrical engineering department. "Google must be cheered for trying to use AI to do video understanding. But I do not believe Google can make any promise that would hold water about being able to remove all bad videos." It comes as Google this week said it will step up the use of similar software on YouTube to analyse the content and context of videos, and flag those that may contain extremist material.  Google has come under fire for failing to identify and remove extremist content on YouTube Credit: Bloomberg The researchers said they were able to fool the new software without any knowledge of how the system, which was released as a trial to computer developers a few weeks ago, works.  "The average user wanting to watch a video is not going to be spending time bypassing this," said Mr Poovendran. "But often those who intent to put illegal videos are very, very tech savvy. They can figure out how to bypass the Google's AI system easily." Hossein Hosseini, the lead author on the study added: "Such vulnerability of the video annotation system seriously undermines its usability in real-world applications."  Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics Extremism Artificial Intelligence Google YouTube Show more Technology latest 01:26 05 Apr 2017, 6:00am The evolution of wearable technology 04 Apr 2017, 8:01pm Comment: The robots may well be coming to steal your job - but don't be afraid James Quinn Premium 04 Apr 2017, 5:48pm Sir Tim Berners-Lee warns Government against 'disaster' of breaking encryption 04 Apr 2017, 5:36pm Looking for a new job?

Premium music services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer are also growing in popularity. This upward trend should continue, especially now that another familiar name has introduced its own streaming music service Pandora Launches a Premium Music Streaming Service Pandora Launches a Premium Music Streaming Service Pandora is launching an on-demand music streaming service to rival Spotify and Apple Music. The question is can Pandora Premium differentiate itself from the competition? Read More . Pandora Premium arrives a few months after the company purchased key assets from the now-defunct Rdio Pandora Buys Rdio, Google Answers Questions, the $10 Android... [Digest] Pandora Buys Rdio, Google Answers Questions, the $10 Android... [Digest] Pandora picks over the bones of Rdio, Google gains intelligence, Walmart sells a cheap Android handset, the Tears of Joy emoji wins Word of the Year, and how to build a time machine, theoretically speaking. Read More . Will Pandora Premium Find Success? It remains an open question whether Pandora Premium will find success. However, the company does have 81 million reasons to be optimistic. That is, if you hadn’t already guessed, the number of active users who listen to Pandora each month. By comparison, there are 50 million Spotify Premium subscribers and 20 million paying customers to Apple Music. If Pandora can turn just 10 percent of those listeners into paying customers, Pandora Premium would become the third most-popular music streaming service, ahead of Deezer, which has 6.9 million users. What Does Pandora Premium Offer? Generally speaking, Pandora Premium is very similar to other subscription-based music streaming services. For $9.99 per month, you have unlimited access to millions of songs that you can listen to or download for offline use across multiple platforms. So why try it? As a long-time Spotify Premium subscriber Is It Worth Upgrading to Spotify Premium? Is It Worth Upgrading to Spotify Premium? Spotify Free brings you tons of music at no cost, but are the extra features of Spotify Premium worth shelling out for? Let's find out... Read More (which is well worth the upgrade), I was excited to put Pandora Premium throught its paces. Having tested the new music subscription service for a couple of weeks, we have come up with six reasons it’s worth giving a spin. 1. Pandora Premium Focuses on What You Love One of the things I’ve always appreciated about Spotify Premium is its many curation tools that help you find new music to enjoy. Curation is also a part of Pandora Premium, but not to the same degree. Instead, the focus here is on providing easy access to the songs and albums you already love. Under the “My Music” tab, you’ll find recently played songs, albums, and stations. Better still, Pandora Premium sorts this content in reverse chronological order, which pushes the stuff you listen to most on Pandora The Best Mac Apps For Listening To Pandora The Best Mac Apps For Listening To Pandora Love Pandora, but not in your browser? Here are the best Mac apps for the job – regardless of whether you're a Pandora One subscriber. Read More right to the top. I’ll never grow tired of finding new music through Spotify Premium, but I can recognize that not everyone likes getting lost in new music. For those folks, Pandora Premium might be a better solution. 2. Pandora Premium Offers Curation Tools Although it takes a toned down approach, Pandora Premium does still offer a selection of curation tools. Under “Browse,” you’ll find new music that’s tailored to you every week, including recommendations based on the albums and genres that your history says you like. You’ll also find sections that include the top songs and albums that are being enjoyed by other Pandora Premium users. 3. Pandora Premium Ups Its Search Game Pandora Premium has 40 million songs in its library, which compares nicely with other services. What you won’t find here, however, are things like karaoke tracks, knock-off tributes, and duplicate tracks, which Pandora says slow down other services when it comes to search. Regarding the time it takes to perform a search, I haven’t noticed much of a difference between Pandora Premium and other similar services such as the new Napster The New Napster: Even Better Than the Old Napster? The New Napster: Even Better Than the Old Napster? Did you know that Napster still exists today, even though it's a completely different service than the old Napster? Let's see how the new Napster compares to the old Napster. Read More . However, I have noticed that the results seem less cluttered on Pandora Premium, even though the actual content is essentially the same. Now that I know Pandora Premium doesn’t include odd-sounding cover tracks, I’ll take a closer look in the future. 4. Giving Pandora Premium the Old Thumbs Up Thumbing tracks up and down has always been an important part of listening to Pandora Radio. The premium service retains this feature, but with extra bells and whistles. First, right out of the box, Pandora has kept track of every song you’ve ever thumbed up across all your stations and added them to a “My Thumbs Up” playlist in Pandora Premium. Yes, every song. Additionally, whenever you give a track the thumbs up in a radio station, the song is automatically added to a playlist for that station. To do it again just add another song. You can either enjoy this playlist or forget about it. Regardless, you now have another place to find music you already love. You can manually remove these tracks from the playlist or download them to your device. Want more content to enjoy in a playlist This Smart Trick Keeps Your Pandora Stations Fresh This Smart Trick Keeps Your Pandora Stations Fresh Pandora is a great music service, but sometimes your stations get a little stale. Here's an easy way to improve them without any effort. Read More ? Just click “Add similar songs” and Pandora will use a special algorithm to introduce new content based on what’s already there. For example, I thumbed up five songs from the Classic Rock Radio station, which automatically created a new playlist. These songs included “Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin, “Fortunate Son” by Creedence Clearwater Revival, “Hotel California” by the Eagles, “For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield, and “House Of The Rising Sun” by The Animals. After clicking “Add similar songs,” Pandora added five additional tracks from groups like The Mamas & The Papas and Lynyrd Skynyrd. A good match, no? There’s a similar solution for when you want to create a manual playlist. After you add a few songs, and with some help from the Music Genome Project, Pandora Premium will add similar songs with just a click of a button. That way, you’ll always have music playing. 5. Pandora Premium’s Sleek New Interface While some services like to pack lots of information on a single screen, Pandora Premium takes a different approach. Its main pages are intuitive and approachable, while its “Now Playing” page is just beautiful, as you can see here: Throughout, you’ll find menus and controls that just seem to make sense. 6. Pandora Premium Keeps It Family Friendly Pandora Premium has recognized that explicit music isn’t for everyone. Because of this, it allows you to remove this content from Pandora Premium radio stations and search. Just toggle “Allow explicit content” to the Off position under your account settings. What’s Missing From Pandora Premium There are two things you won’t see on Pandora Premium. The first is exclusive albums and content. As Pandora CEO Tim Westergren told The Verge: That’s not a focus for us. I don’t really think that’s a winning strategy for anybody — either services or the artist or labels. Second is the unique Autoplay feature that made Rdio great. With Autoplay, you could keep the music playing by auto-starting a station based on what was recently played. That way, the music would never end unless and until you hit Pause. Luckily, Autoplay is scheduled to arrive in a future Pandora Premium update. Give Pandora Premium a Spin I’m pleasantly surprised by Pandora Premium and plan on continuing to use it through my free 60-day trial. It offers a refreshing new way to listen to music legally 7 Sites To Get Free Music (Legally!) 7 Sites To Get Free Music (Legally!) If you're the type of person who loves tending to a vast music collection, there are still ways to get free music. Here are seven websites to get you started... Read More . For long-time Pandora Radio users, I would strongly recommend Pandora Premium. It provides a familiar setup with lots of new goodies. Subscribers to other premium services should also take Pandora’s new service out for a test drive. It might not provide the perfect fit, but, depending on your preferences, it could still be worth your time and consideration. Pandora Premium is being rolled out gradually. To grab yourself an invite, be sure to visit the official Pandora Premium website. Existing Pandora Plus users will be offered six months of Pandora Premium for free. Non-Pandora Plus users will receive a two-month free trial. Are you planning on trying Pandora Premium? Please let us know in the comments below.

(Photo credit: ANGELO MERENDINO/AFP/Getty Images)    Google Says Employee Was Secretly Building Another Company While They Paid Him $120 Million Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 11:55 AM 04/04/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5571973 Google is accusing its former self-driving car chief of surreptitiously building his own company while working and making $120 million in incentives at the company. The allegations surfaced after Google filed an arbitration demand Monday against the autonomous vehicle expert Anthony Levandowski and another once-classified employee, according to CNBC. Google says Levandowski didn’t disclose the fact that he was developing Otto, a self-driving startup, until after he received the huge payout. Uber purchased Otto in August in a deal reportedly worth $680 million. (RELATED: Uber, Anheuser-Busch Use Self-Driving Truck To Deliver 45,000 Cans Of ‘America’) The accusations are part of a larger legal dispute between Google, Uber, and Levandowski. Waymo, the driverless car company owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company, issued a lawsuit against Uber and Levandowski in February. (RELATED: The Self-Driving Revolution Has Hit A MASSIVE Roadblock) Waymo and Google assert that Levandowski stole 14,000 files worth of classified information while employed there, including the company’s blueprint for the LiDAR sensor, which helps a vehicle map the environment around it, and thus is a critical component for autonomous functionality. “Fair competition spurs new technical innovation, but what has happened here is not fair competition,” the official complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco reads. “Instead, Otto and Uber have taken Waymo’s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology.” Waymo says it became aware of Levandowski’s alleged transgressions after mistakenly receiving an email from one of its suppliers specializing in LiDAR with attachments of machine drawings that were marked as Uber’s design, but were very similar to it’s own “unique LiDAR design.” “Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company,” Waymo wrote in an official blog post announcing the lawsuit. The court case appears to be off to a rocky start. Levandowski reportedly refused to testify during recent court proceedings. Waymo also says that Uber violated a court’s order to produce all documents necessary for the case. Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

For Google, the largest internet advertising provider, this has been a serious problem. Now, they're trying to address it in order to put advertisers at ease. Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages. Google engineers, product managers and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Advertisers may tolerate use of a racial epithet in a hip-hop video, for example, but may be horrified to see it used in a video from a racist skinhead group. That ads bought by well-known companies can occasionally appear next to offensive videos has long been considered a nuisance to YouTube’s business. But the issue has gained urgency in recent weeks, as The Times of London and other outlets have written about brands that inadvertently fund extremists through automated advertising — a byproduct of a system in which YouTube shares a portion of ad sales with the creators of the content those ads appear against. It's a justified concern for those brands. Unfortunately, it raises concerns in a different direction. The "engineers, product managers, and policy wonks" described are people, and that introduces a potential problem. What are these people's biases and will they use that to influence the training the advertising bots will get? Google Pledges $11.5 Million to Make Sure Black Lives Matter For example, a large portion of the criticism of President Obama was labeled as racist. How will that come into play?

The move comes as the internet colossus scrambles to derail an advertising boycott of Google’s money-making engine. Google said it was using new machine-learning or artificial intelligence systems to enforce its policies, to help content objectionable to advertisers. These systems will be adapted to advertiser preferences, Google said. The tech giant also said it would work with third parties to help advertisers protect their brands from unwanted placement. “As part of our commitment to provide even more transparency and visibility to our advertising partners, we’ll be working with trusted vendors to provide third-party brand safety reporting on YouTube,” a Google spokesperson said on Monday. Google chief business officer Phillip Schindler recently apologised and said the company was taking a “tougher stance” on hateful, offensive, or derogatory content while ramping up safeguards to make sure ads only appear with acceptable material from legitimate creators. Google has continued to downplay the effect of the boycott. California-based Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads fearing placement alongside extremist content, has introduced new tools to give firms greater control. The boycott began in February after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programs were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google had failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the European Union after it anonymously signaled their presence. The British government subsequently put its YouTube advertising on hold, saying in a statement, “it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content.” Others to pull the plug included the BBC, The Guardian newspaper group, McDonalds UK and the British arm of the major advertising agency Havas. The movement spread to the United States, with AT&T and Verizon pulling ads from Google. A solution may not be easy. Google needs to strike a balance between pleasing advertisers and those who upload videos to YouTube and are free to take their creations elsewhere if unsatisfied with their shares of ad revenue.

The bill pulls browsing histories out of the murky gray market of the already sleazy data-resale market and turns these data trails into just another digital commodity. This is a body blow for privacy. Browser histories connect nearly every dot of our daily lives, from the financial and e-mail services that we regularly access to the searches we run. The nightmare scenarios created by this bill's passage are as dark as they are feasible, if not inevitable, and now’s the time to learn how to be stealthy online. These are perfectly manageable strategies to limit tracking, now that tracking is more ubiquitous than ever.  What Doesn't Work Incognito or Private Browsing There are excellent reasons to go incognito, private, or whatever your Web browser calls its discreet browsing mode. These features prevent the browser itself from automatically generating its own saved logs of where you've gone. There's real privacy here, but only in relation to other people you already know — usually friends or family — who might hop onto your device, start tapping in a Google search, and get a list of suggestions or previously entered words that raise uncomfortable questions. But internet service providers (ISPs) and the companies that specialize in data tracking aren't so easily fooled. They're tracking raw activity, generating their own detailed logs even when your browser isn't. Clearing Your History Manually clearing your history is a retroactive version of going incognito, flushing your browser of saved URLs. But data trackers don't often raid your local files to piece together your online activity. Why bother, when they can just connect your unique internet protocol (IP) address to every stop you make on the internet? There have been scattered cases of companies running code that actually digs into your locally stored history, but those are outliers, and this new bill doesn’t make that sort of trap easier to spring or more permissible. In general, a cleared browser history is either about tidying up, or keeping those closest to you from snooping, whether by accident or design. MORE: How to Keep Your Data Safe While Traveling What Works a Little Always Try to Visit HTTPS Websites When you navigate through a domain that's on a standard Web server — one whose URL starts with “http” — ISPs and tracking firms can follow you through every link on that site. An https domain, on the other hand, acts as a data fortress. Trackers will know you entered the site, but have to sit outside the secure server, wondering at your activity within until you wander back out of the front gate. This limits the amount and the specificity of tracking, but it's impossible to restrict your online activity to https sites. But if given the choice between similar Web sites, and one has an https URL, head for the more secure option. Stop Googling The most common form of data tracking revolves around Web searches. Your search history is an ever-growing, increasingly detailed heat map of your public and private interests and activity. That this heat map can be misleading only makes its creation and collection more damaging. What if you're terrified of ISIS and regularly look for information related to their methods and targets? There's nothing preventing a third-party from misinterpreting that raw data, and flagging you as a threat. One relatively painless way to limit this form of tracking is to stop assuming that Google is the only way to find things online, and start using a search engine that's specifically designed to confound tracking. Our current favorite is Disconnect. It won't offer to finish your sentences or automatically serve up links to relevant locations on Google Maps, but that's the tradeoff. Everything has a cost, including convenience. Clear Caches & Cookies Internet cookies are the original internet tracking threat, tiny packages of data that load onto your device and report your activity back to their masters. Clearing them out on a regular basis will reduce the total amount of information that sites and data trackers pull from your activity but won't impact what your ISP collects. Turn On Do-Not-Track Settings Most browsers, and some services, allow you to automatically send Do-Not-Track (DNT) requests to advertisers, essentially begging them to not use your activity to feed you targeted ads, as well as build profiles. This is something of a gentleman's agreement, though, and doesn't apply to many dedicated tracking firms, or to ISPs. Still, it's worth taking a quick trip through your software and services, and enabling Do Not Track where possible. Lifehacker’s roundup of DNT options dates back to the original, and ultimately failed, campaign to stop ad-based tracking, but it’s still useful. MORE: 8 Ways to Keep Your Data Secure What Really Works Use A Tor-Based Browser It's almost impossible to do anything with a browser without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs. The above tips are all half-measures at best, especially since the tracking at issue in this latest bill is baseline data collection, and ISPs don't give a damn about Do Not Track requests. Neither do the least scrupulous data trackers, the exact firms that are most likely to sell your information to those who would abuse it the most. Big Data is done with such niceties, and if you're serious about limiting your exposure, you should be, too. The proper response to this latest erosion of digital privacy is to go anonymous while browsing, or as close to anonymous as you feel like attempting. The easiest tool for this is the Tor browser, which is a free download for Mac OS and Windows. A Tor-based browser called OrFox is available for Android, but installing it is a multistep process. And the iOS version, Onion Browser, is a step down in effectiveness. None of these applications offer a pretty or effortless browsing experience, and you’ll notice the downgrade in polish, load times, and features compared to Chrome or Safari. They're also only a partial solution. By bouncing your data transfers around a network of servers, the browser complicates the efforts of data trackers that are effectively stalking you, attaching your browsing history in a new session to previous sessions. Those unsettling data profiles can also tie your activity to a specific physical location. But Tor isn't perfect. It's hard but still possible for algorithms to see through the software's shell game, and start piecing together a comprehensive profile, possibly even identifying you. Still, Tor browsers, in all of their forms, are an excellent first line of defense. And this goes for whatever you do with a Web browser, whether it's shopping (where companies like Amazon will happily store your search and purchase histories), tumbling down YouTube rabbit holes, or, of course, looking at porn. Features like Chrome's Incognito mode can wall off portions of your activity, but only a more drastic measure, such as using Tor, has a chance of throwing tracking algorithms off your scent. We realize, by the way, that making the leap to a Tor browser is a hassle. But the war on privacy is real, and one-sided. The choice is clear — either you take direct and sometimes annoying action to avoid persistent, pervasive snooping, or you admit defeat. Both choices are yours to make, but don't kid yourself. No one is going to safeguard your privacy for you, or restore it once it's gone. MORE: Politicians Have Voted to Fundamentally Alter Basic Internet Privacy What You Don't Have To Worry About, More Than You Already Did Making Calls Though this bill allows for a wide range of online tracking — or wider than what was already considered legal — it doesn't change the security or data footprint of phone calls made over standard cellular networks. We still recommend using the free Signal app for encrypted smartphone calls, but the only vulnerability related to the bill in question is in standard internet-based calls, such as using Skype or FaceTime, both of which encrypt their actual calls. Internet service providers can sell records showing when you accessed these services, and savvy trackers (whether they're legit firms or hackers) could possibly cross-reference those sessions with the activity of other users. But that's a bridge too paranoid to cross just yet. Unless you're a high-value target, it'll take a few more invasive acts of legislation before you need to worry about that level of sophistication in data snooping. Sending Messages With An App Internet service providers (ISPs) and even phone-makers will gladly monitor and share customers' mobile data use. That can include specifics related to apps. But these data aren't picked up by most traditional online tracking software, and don't tend to factor into the profiles that data brokers build. And since e-mail apps don’t generally ask for log-in credentials every time you check your inbox — and saved credentials are stored in the phone, and not in a browser — there’s less chance of tracking and paving the way for password-stealing malware. Texts are also no more or less secure in the aftermath of this bill. For ultra-secure messages, you can use the Signal app, but even your standard Gmail or Yahoo account isn’t significantly more vulnerable now, provided you avoid reaching them via Web browser. Remember, browsers are old, established internet tech, and code that spies on your activity through them is just as mature. Individual vulnerabilities and data breaches notwithstanding — see Facebook's woes below — apps are the more privacy-minded choice ... for now. Using Social Media — Because Those Services Are Already A Privacy Nightmare Long before this bill cleared Congress, Facebook had been the worst thing to happen to digital privacy since the internet. The company has sold the user data it collects, allowed third parties to scrape profiles themselves, and actively tries to connect you to complete strangers, to the extent that you have to dig through settings to keep from broadcasting your personal information to the world. Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and other social media services are less of a privacy threat, only because they ask for less personal information. But all of these outlets are a careful-what-you-wish-for proposition, empowering sharing while inviting snooping. This legislation doesn't significantly impact this tradeoff, except to potentially confirm to data brokers which services you're a member of, and therefore which ones to monitor for relevant posts. Creepy, sure, but it’s nothing new, because the trackers-that-be have been stalking those services since they launched. Want More?

Recent reports brought the issue to light and in response, brands have been pulling ad campaigns while Google piles more AI resources into verifying videos’ content. But the problem is, the search giant’s current algorithms might just not be up to the task. A recent research paper, published by the University of Washington and spotted by Quartz, makes the problem clear. It tests Google’s Cloud Video Intelligence API, which is designed to be used by clients to automatically classify the content of videos with object recognition. (The system is currently in private beta and not in use on YouTube or any other Google products — those use different systems.) The API, which is powered by deep neural networks, works very well against regular videos, but researchers found it was easily tricked by a determined adversary. In the paper, the University of Washington researchers describe how a test video (provided by Google and named Animals.MP4) is given the tags “Animal,” “Wildlife,” “Zoo,” “Nature,” and “Tourism” by the company’s API. However, when the researchers inserted pictures of a car into the video the API said, with 98 percent certainty, that the video should be given the tag “Audi.” The frames — called “adversarial images” in this context — were inserted roughly once every two seconds. An illustration of how images are inserted into videos to fool Google’s API. Image: “Deceiving Google’s Cloud Video Intelligence API Built for Summarizing Videos” “Such vulnerability seriously undermines the applicability of the API in adversarial environments,” write the researchers. “For example [...] an adversary can bypass a video filtering system by inserting a benign image into a video with illegal contents.” This work underscores a clear trend in the tech world. As companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter deal with unsavory content on their platforms, they’re increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to help sort and classify data. However, AI systems are never perfect, and they often make mistakes or are capable of being tricked. This already been proved with Google’s anti-troll filters, which are designed to classify insults but can be fooled by slang, rogue punctuation, and typos. It seems it still takes human to reliably tell us what humans are really up to. Update April 4th, 12:04PM: The story’s been updated to clarify that the API tool is not currently being deployed on YouTube.

Play Video 48 Hours Full Episodes Kiss of Death and the Google Exec The mysterious death of a Google executive and his last night with an exotic beauty captured on video -- now a court decides her fate. "48 Hours"... Santa Cruz sheriff’s officials confirmed Monday that they turned over 30-year-old Alix Tichelman to the custody of Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on the morning she completed her sentence and was released from jail on March 29. The Santa Cruz Sentinel, citing court records, says Tichelman holds dual citizenship in the United States and Canada. An ICE spokesman didn’t return a call Monday seeking federal custody information. A Santa Cruz County Superior Court judge in 2015 sentenced Tichelman to five years in prison after she pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and administering drugs. “48 Hours” investigated the case in the episode, “Kiss of Death and the Google Exec.” WATCH: “48 Hours:” “Kiss of Death and the Google Exec” Counting time served before her guilty plea, Tichelman was released after serving about half her sentence, with time off for good behavior. In November 2013, Tichelman injected Forrest Timothy Hayes with heroin, then left without seeking help when he passed out on the yacht, authorities say. Hayes had hired Tichelman several times before, and they were doing drugs and having sex the night he died, authorities said. Play Video 48 Hours Segment Extras A look inside Forrest Hayes' "Escape" Google executive Forrest Hayes clearly loved his yacht "Escape" and spent a great deal of time and effort to outfit it exactly the way he wanted.... The high-end call girl was arrested eight months after Hayes’ death. Santa Cruz police said a surveillance video at the Santa Cruz harbor showed the woman gather her belongings, casually step over Hayes’ body, finish a glass of wine and lower a blind before leaving the yacht the night before the body was discovered. The video also showed Tichelman panicking and attempting to revive Hayes as he slipped into unconsciousness before leaving the yacht, Santa Cruz Deputy District Attorney Rafael Vazquez said. READ: Who’s to blame in Google exec’s OD death? Santa Cruz Sheriff Sgt. Chris Clark said ICE agents appeared at the Northern California jail to detain Tichelman on her release. Clark said sheriff officials declined to honor an ICE request to hold Tichelman for two days after her release date. Clark said this is the fifth time immigration enforcement agents have appeared at the Santa Cruz County jail this year to detain an inmate being released. © 2017 The Associated Press.

The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune thanks to Berners-Lee's efforts to make the internet more accessible and useful. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) San Francisco • Most people who search on Google, share on Facebook and shop on Amazon have never heard of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year's recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing's version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "It's a crowning achievement," Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. "But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help." The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee's efforts to make the internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video — everything, really, beyond plain text — online. SPINNING THE WEB Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world's first website, http://info.cern.ch . Besides coming up with the web's technical specifications, Berners-Lee "offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole," said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he'd laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. CAUGHT IN THE WEB The web's widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the U.S. and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the web will become less accessible in the U.S. if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting "net neutrality." That's the principle that internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, "it's going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realize it's important," Berners-Lee said. "It allowed America to benefit from a thriving internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America." Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a "recurrent threat." He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn't have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is "really important to the future of society," he says. "As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person." BEYOND THE WEB Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn't sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. "Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so It's only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us," Berners-Lee said. "So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences." This is the 50th anniversary of the A.M. Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany's codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 2 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Utah Jazz pick up a win, and yet another injury, against the Trail Blazers Sports on TV: Should the Mountain West Conference and BYU cut TV cord?

Early-bird pricing at 50% off ends April 14. Register here. “Jeff Dean doesn’t exist; he’s actually an advanced AI created by Jeff Dean.” — from Jeff Dean Facts — Google’s internal running doc of quotes about Jeff Dean The future of Google is artificial intelligence, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said. Jeff Dean, co-founder the Google Brain project, believes AI is the future of all business. “I think it is really important that companies understand what is now possible that wasn’t possible five or six years ago, and really embrace that and figure out how they can make that work for their business,” Dean said last year. “The more forward-looking companies will be happier that they have started to think about this.’’ As Google Senior Fellow and the lead of the Google Brain research project, Dean has been leading the charge toward integrating AI and machine learning into the core of Google’s offerings, with the application of terabytes of data and neural nets that learn to recognize patterns and emerge with insights humans could not have predicted. Since the project’s founding in 2011, Dean’s research team has helped transform a swath of Google’s products, from YouTube, to translation to photo recognition. Google Brain is proving that artificial intelligence can solve problems that confounded conventional efforts for decades. “Google: it’s basically Jeff Dean’s side project.” — Jeff Dean Facts At Google, Dean became a legend as one of the company’s first employees and the architect of most of the technology that underlies the massive Google machine. The projects he was instrumental in developing — MapReduce, BigTable, and Spanner — aren’t the sexy products consumers are most familiar with. They are, however, the programs that make up the foundation of Google’s intelligence as we know it — and, of the modern web in general. MapReduce, which parallelized the processing of huge data sets, freed up Google programmers to try things they might not have previously attempted. MapReduce quickly became the industry standard and makes up the underpinning of Hadoop, the open-source software that allows scalable, distributed computing and introduced the phrase “big data” to the industry. Dean also developed the distributed data storage system called BigTable that can handle petabytes of data; Spanner, the “world’s largest single database,” took it a step further. It’s designed to seamlessly operate across hundreds of data centers globally, on millions of machines and through trillions of rows of information—and is how Google can offer a stable web service to a worldwide audience. And the projects he’s working on now have the potential to revolutionize information technology once again. “Jeff Dean’s résumé lists the things he hasn’t done; it’s shorter that way.” — Jeff Dean Facts Four years ago, Google Brain’s major triumph was a brain simulator able to teach itself how to search for cats in YouTube videos. Now projects range from teaching computers how to translate foreign languages to creating art and writing music. One of Dean’s top interests is speech recognition, using deep learning to recognize speech in a wide variety of contexts. Machine learning models can already understand sentence-length pieces of text, with the ability to process and understand long chunks of text just on the horizon. His other pet project is transforming healthcare with AI, to offer second opinions and drive better outcomes. Applying pattern recognition to medical images is showing tremendous promise in detecting anomalies that the naked eye, even an expert one, might miss. To date, Google Brain has created more than a thousand deep learning projects with tremendous potential. “One of the great things we have seen in the past five years is that you can see the possibilities of using this in nearly every business,” Dean said recently. “Some companies are pretty forward-looking and are putting together small teams to investigate how to improve their business.” “When Graham Bell invented the telephone, he saw a missed call from Jeff Dean.” — Jeff Dean Facts This year, Jeff Dean, the brain behind Google Brain, will be one of the premier speakers at VentureBeat’s invite-only event, VB Summit. Industry leaders and innovators will tackle the massive disruption AI and machine learning is creating across the digital ecosystem — and how companies can take advantage of the opportunities that emerging from the cracks.

Now he's getting a big check from the internet giant to expand into new products and regions. Alphabet's venture arm — once called Google Ventures, now known as GV — said Tuesday it joined Sequoia Capital in leading a $90 million financing of Cohesity, with the aim of helping businesses make use of mountains of stashed-away data. Secondary storage is the stuff that corporations typically archive or save for protection in case primary files get lost or corrupted. It sits on tape and disks in dark data centers. It's certainly not a subject you imagine drawing much attention in Silicon Valley, particularly in the halls of a company like Google. But what if rather than sitting dormant, all that secondary storage could be used and accessed at any time? Karim Faris, the GV partner who led the Cohesity investment, said his team had been looking for a product that could "light up" that data through software. GV put some money into the last round in 2015 and is now stepping up in a hefty way. "Cohesity brings instant access, search, discoverability and the ability to restore data very easily," Faris said in an interview. "They figured out a way to seamlessly insert themselves into the flow of how you do things." show chapters Cashin: Froth in venture capital market    Monday, 2 Mar 2015 | 10:43 AM ET | 03:49 Aron is part of a small exodus of entrepreneurs from Nutanix, which pioneered a type of computing infrastructure known as "hyperconverged" storage that combines storage hardware with various types of software, all stored in a single inexpensive device that runs in a company's data center. Nutanix was one of the first big billion-dollar "unicorn" start-ups of the current generation, raising nearly $500 million to reach a valuation of more than $2 billion before finally going public last September. It's currently worth about $2.5 billion. Aron co-founded Nutanix, then left in 2013 to start Cohesity; one of Cohesity's primary competitors is a start-up called Rubrik, which was started in 2014 by Bipul Sinha, a board member at Nutanix and major investor in that company. Both Cohesity and Rubrik have turned to engineers from Google and other massive consumer internet companies to develop the next generation of backup technology for the business world. Aron said about 30 percent of his 35-person engineering team came from Google. For its part, Rubrik raised a $61 million round in August and said in February that it's approaching $100 million in annualized bookings. Ask Aron or Sinha whom they consider their primary competitors and both mention legacy hardware vendors with single-purpose boxes. Aron said that in 80 percent of deals Cohesity is vying with companies like CommVault and EMC's Data Domain. His team scours the market for businesses that have switched another part of the business from a traditional vendor to something new. For example, companies that have moved from disk storage to flash make good prospects. "It gives us an indication that they're looking for alternatives," Aron said. The financing round includes capital from Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise as well as a number of existing investors. Aron said the capital infusion will go toward building the company's sales and marketing efforts and pushing deeper into Europe and Asia. As for product development, Aron said backup and data protection get customers in the door, but in the future businesses will turn to Cohesity for more advanced uses like analytics and test and development. "That's where our R&D efforts are going," he said.

Ron Amadeo - Apr 4, 2017 3:00 pm UTC reader comments 22 Share this story The Pixel C was the only device with any real visual changes, so we'll cover it in this gallery. In 7.1.2, it gets the Pixel launcher and Google System UI. The means round icons and solid white navigation buttons. Here's 7.1.1 for reference. There are normal icon shapes and outline navigation buttons. Check out the new recent apps list. This looks like something that was designed for phones. The old 7.1.1 interface was just the phone interface. The app drawer is new, too, and more spaced out. The old app drawer was cramped. The new "Battery alert" screen. Unfortunately (I guess?), I've never had a misbehaving app to see what it does. After a lengthy beta period that began in January, Google released Android Nougat 7.1.2 on Monday. Images and OTAs are up on Google's factory image page, and a rollout has started to creep across the Google device landscape. Google is releasing the update for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, 5X, and Nexus Player. As we reported during the beta release, 7.1.2 marks the end of the line for the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9, Google's flagship devices from 2014. Further ReadingOne year later: Can Android 7.0 Nougat save the Pixel C?The biggest changes in Android 7.1.2 specifically single out the Pixel C—the update treats Google's flagship tablet like a real Pixel device. The device gets all the Pixel-exclusive features like the Pixel launcher, a blue settings app, and the Pixel's trademark solid-white navigation buttons. 7.1.2 also redesigns the Pixel C's recent apps screen. Instead of being the blown-up phone version like nearly everything on an Android tablet, the update introduces a tablet-specific design that shows a 3×2 grid of thumbnails. For everyone else, 7.1.2 is a minor release, mostly packing a few bug fixes. Here is the changelog for the Pixel Phones: Improved fingerprint swipe performance Bluetooth connectivity improvements Battery usage alerts Some of the other fixes deal with the early shutdown issue, a small number of users experiencing pink banding on the camera, and the audio popping issue some users were experiencing at high volumes. And for Nexus devices: Enhanced notification stability Fingerprint swipe on 5X/6P General connectivity improvements Battery usage alerts The one new feature for all devices is a new "Battery Usage Alerts" screen in the battery settings. This will apparently point out apps that are critically draining your battery, but I've never seen it show anything other than a blank screen that says "no alerts." As usual, the OTA process can take about a month to come to everyone, but if you're willing to flash, you can get the update right now. Non-Google Android phones can expect to get the update in about four to six months—if they get it at all.

Cassidy created Apollo Fusion to develop “revolutionary hybrid reactor technology with fusion power to serve safe, clean, and affordable electricity to everyone.” Cassidy was formerly vice president of Google research lab Alphabet’s X, and headed its high-altitude, balloon-based internet access initiative. He’s still an adviser at Google, after stepping down as vice president of the research lab in 2017. Cassidy thinks nuclear power is essential to fighting global warming, and he wants to make the benefits of nuclear fusion so obvious that environmentalists have no choice but to embrace it. “Environmentalists have struggled for a while over whether nuclear power is good or bad. I think most of the more thoughtful environmentalists now view nuclear as good,” Cassidy told Bloomberg. “If you can find a way to do nuclear power that doesn’t have the downsides, the risky, runaway meltdowns, or things like that, it’s a real win for the planet.” Nuclear fusion is different from conventional nuclear energy, since fusion causes atoms to join together at extremely high temperatures to release huge amounts of energy. Apollo says fusion technology is very safe since it breaks down when there’s a loss of cooling or control, meaning it can’t melt down. The process leaves almost no waste and wouldn’t even require hazardous fuel. Proponents say nuclear fusion power could be “too cheap to meter,” arguing it would be too cheap and abundant to even bother measuring individual use and cost. Apollo isn’t alone. Other companies have made some recent breakthroughs in fusion in the hopes of restarting the atomic age. Scientists believe “fast ignition” could allow a fusion reaction to be controlled because it requires less “start-up” energy than other methods. An American research team in January discovered a “fast ignition” to start up fusion reactors using a high-intensity laser, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The current problem with fusion reactors is that they are difficult to keep running. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division is developing a compact fusion reactor that’s small enough to fit in a truck, but powerful enough to power 80,000 homes. Apollo hopes research will allow scientists to design reactors capable of better controlling the plasma. Current experimental fusion reactors heat the plasma to more than 150 million degrees Celsius, simulating the conditions that cause natural nuclear fusion reactions in stars. These reactor’s strong magnetic fields are used to keep the plasma away from the reactor’s walls so that it doesn’t cool down and lose energy. Other studies have suggested ways to improve fusion reactors by precisely shaping the magnetic field generated by their electromagnetic coils.

EugenioOrtega / Pixabay What’s fixed for Nexus and Pixel devices? Google announced that Android 7.1.2 contains several new features, general performance/stability improvements and a number of bug fixes. Some of the changes and updates for Nexus devices are fingerprint swipe on the 5X/6P, battery usage alerts, enhanced notification stability and general connectivity improvements. The official changelog for the Pixel and Pixel XL includes improved fingerprint swipe performance, Bluetooth connectivity improvements and battery usage alerts. Some Pixel users were experiencing a bug which caused the camera app to hang with purple and pink lines on the screen. One user said that the “camera ends up with large blocks moved randomly around the screen.” In addition to the camera-related issues, several problems with speaker clipping/popping at high volumes were also reported by consumers. All of these are expected to be fixed with Android 7.1.2. “Some of the other fixes are with the early shutdown issue, a fix for the small number of users experiencing pink banding on the camera, and a fix to the audio popping issue some users were experiencing at high volumes,” a Nexus Community Manager said in a blog post. Android 7.1.2 is finally bringing the new Pixel Launcher to Google’s last remaining supported tablet and will finally eliminate the icon that was used before to show the app drawer. Users can now just swipe up from the navigation bar to access the icon. Android 7.1.2 not for the Nexus 6 and 9 The security fixes for both Pixel and Nexus devices can be found on both Android 7.1.1 and the Android 7.1.2 build; hence, users have options. It is recommended that users get the latest Android version with the most recent security update, but if they do not like something, they can return to a previous version without losing the security update. However, the latest rollout will not come to the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9, as both have reached the end of their lives and will stay on the older Android 7.1.1, notes AndroidCentral. Currently, we can see files for the Pixel C, Pixel and XL, Nexus Player, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 5X. The builds range from versions N2G47F on the Nexus 5X, N2G47H on the Nexus Player and 6P, N2G47E and N2G47J on the Pixel and Pixel XL, respectively, and N2G47D on the Pixel C (N2G47J is for Deutsche Telekom customers only). Android 7.1.2 will be rolled out slowly to supported devices over the coming weeks, but if users cannot wait, they can manually flash the factory images and OTA zips, which are available for download at their respective hyperlinks.

By: Bloomberg | Published: April 4, 2017 8:23 PM Waymo and Levandowski’s current employer Uber Technologies Inc. are locked in a contentious legal battle over autonomous vehicle technology.(Linkdin) A former Google engineer at the center of a fight over self-driving car technology made more than $120 million, according to a legal filing Monday, highlighting the intense competition among tech companies and carmakers for talent in the nascent sector. The autonomous vehicle unit, now called Waymo, claimed in an arbitration demand against the former employee, Anthony Levandowski, that he breached his contract by recruiting from its ranks for his rival company, Otto, — while collecting more than $120 million in incentive payments from the search giant. Waymo and Levandowski’s current employer Uber Technologies Inc. are locked in a contentious legal battle over autonomous vehicle technology. The ride-hailing company is trying to persuade a court that Waymo’s February lawsuit should be resolved in private arbitration. Waymo had earlier filed an arbitration action against Levandowski. You may also like to watch: Google’s self-driving car project had initially structured its compensation to create specific incentives for the robotics engineers working on the futuristic technology. As the project progressed and evolved into a potential business capable of upending transportation, several early team members got huge payments, as Bloomberg News earlier reported. Uber and Waymo representatives declined to comment on Monday, and Levandowski didn’t respond to a request for comment. Google also alleged that, in addition to Otto, Levandowski helped found two other companies developing laser-based sensor technology that ran afoul of his non-compete agreement with the search giant. Odin Wave LLC and Tyto Lidar LLC were merged by February 2014 and Levandowski had been involved in Odin Wave since at least the previous year, when he was also developing competing technology for Google, according to the legal filing. Google at one stage investigated acquiring the merged company, which was run under the Tyto moniker, and Levandowski took part in that process without disclosing any role at the company, Google said. By May 2016, Tyto had been folded into Otto. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Google announces Android O: Focus on power management, notifications, and more David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/03/21 9:59am PDTMar 21, 2017 192 Plus 1 on G+ 1849 Share on Facebook 224 Share on Twitter Total Shares2265 Android O Android OS Development News   As some had expected based on the timing of last year's Android N announcement, Android O was due sooner or later, and today's the big day: Meet Android O. Which, obviously, doesn't have a full name yet, and probably won't for a long time. So for now, just make up conspiracy theories about those concentric circles up there. What does Android O do? When can you get it? We'll aim to answer all that in posts to come, and I'll give you the brief summary here. First, when can you get it? Well, Google says Android O developer preview images should be available for flashing soon (they'll be here), but it's not clear when "soon" is, but we'd tend to assume based on last year that means today. The eligible devices are the Nexus 5X, 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL (the Nexus 6 and 9 obviously are end-of-lifed, and won't get O). I'll add a link to the images here as soon as we have them - Google notes that these are strictly development images and that they could be very buggy and unstable, and are not suitable for daily use. If you used the early Android N previews, you know they're probably not bluffing on that point. Alright, so what's the deal with Android O? So far, we know a lot, but I would wager that based on what we're seeing at this point that Android O has a lot of evolving to do before we'll really get a clear picture of what it's all about. Most of the changes announced today are under-the-hood stuff aimed at, obviously, developers, rather than consumer-facing things that will change the way your Android device works in some fundamental way. You can read the full blog post here, but I've got a condensed breakdown for you. The first big change is background limits, which will hopefully allow for even greater battery life gains in Android by more strictly limiting what apps and services are allowed to do in the background of the OS. I think we can all get on board with that (documentation here and here). Next is notification channels, one of the few direct user-facing features announced in today's O post. Notification channels will let a developer bundle the types of notification their app produces into types via a standard API, to allow for much more granular control of the types of notifications an app sends you. O will also introduce new notification grouping behavior and a new notification aesthetic, but it's unclear at this point what that means. Here's one you'll cheer for: Android is getting standard Autofill APIs. That means apps like LastPass will finally have a proper, OS-level way to fill in stuff for you. This was sorely needed. Picture in picture video is coming to phones and tablets. It initially launched on Android TV with Nougat. There's also a new windowing feature for apps to use a native overlay window instead of a system alert, as well as support for multi-display so you can launch activities on a remote display (that's neat). It looks like Android will receive Bluetooth aptX support natively in O. Though Google doesn't explicitly say this, we've seen tons of hints about it, so we're pretty sure that's going to be a thing (Google just says "high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs," but aptX is the only one that matters). Sony's LDAC codec is also supported in O. Keyboard navigation will be more strongly supported, with Google saying something kind of vague here about a more "predictable" model for arrow and tab navigation (i.e., an actual model for those things), which is certainly welcome. They mention Android apps on Chrome OS as an impetus here. A new API specifically designed to deliver low-latency audio, AAudio API for Pro Audio, was announced. There's more I haven't mentioned here: Java 8 APIs, WebView enhancements, Wi-Fi NAN, the Telecom framework - and you can read all about them in Google's official blog post, linked at the bottom of this article. As you'd expect, we've got a boatload of feature spotlights lined up for you about O that we'll be cranking out as we get access to the developer previews, so stay tuned. And of course, we welcome you to point out any changes you, our observant reader, spot as well.

Give an *UNDO* button! Lamurias "new API specifically designed to deliver low-latency audio" - I feel like the announce this with every android release... Wadup :/ Alvar Lagerlof Yep. They're releasing that thing every year. instinct I was thinking the same thing. Along with better battery life... which I'm still waiting for. rmagruder The problem is not the API. The problem is that Google doesn't make this a condition of getting Google Play Services. Without that leverage, it is just another ignored API by most Android. OEMs and is only theory for a intents and purposes. Jeremy Reger my last two nexus devices.. Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 6.. probably time to go grab an iphone.. 9 years later sick of fragmentation.. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Oh get another Nexus/Pixel or just get an iPhone. Doesn't matter. Jeremy Reger If I get another one it will just EOL in 2 years.. Good_Ole_Pinocchio That's nothing new. Just get another phone in 2 years.. Or get an IPhone for a longer update window if you want to keep your phone longer than 2 years. This is easy. Jeremy Reger Spending $400 a year on a phone is absurd.. Good_Ole_Pinocchio If that's absurd for you then don't do it. You have other options. Geoff Johnson Why? $400/yr for something I use for hours each day is well worth it. Jeremy Reger Do you buy a new TV every other year too? Jeremy Reger The point would be, its not that its not worth it, but my son's iphone 5 that he got in 2012 is still relevant, still able to get the latest updates and I am able to hook it up to xcode and develop with it just as if I had a brand new iphone 7 Geoff Johnson Why would I? TV's don't advance anywhere near as fast as smartphones do. Jeremy Reger What more are you doing today on your phone than you did 6 years ago? Geoff Johnson 6 years ago was the HTC Thunderbolt. The camera was pitiful, battery life was trash, performance was sluggish, small screen, no NFC, no dual band WiFi, only band 13 LTE, large and clunky, etc. There are things I do on my Pixel now that I couldn't do on that 6 year old phone if I tried. Jeremy Reger I agree.. I was there on the thunderbolt as well, but in ways of truly enhancing my daily life enough to justify $2400 in 6 years.. Me personally can't justify that.. and I did that life for years, just never saw a return on investment other than the ability to talk and reply to my clients practically immediately, which.. I could do on any phone. You've got a point, they do get better, but most things except toasters, microwaves and shovels do.. Just can't continue that lifestyle. thats just for me! haha have a good day man! Impulse_Vigil Do TVs get OS updates every year? Duder12 All Google phones receive security and some maintenance for 3 years. If that's not satisfactory blame Qualcomm MadMartigan Whine about it to Qualcomm, not that it will do you any good. All it will get you here is attacked. Google cannot force Qualcomm to release new drivers for older chipsets and Qualcomm has absolutely no motivation to do so. Barring some real competition in the mobile SoC space or Google designing and manufacturing their own SoC (not likely), Android is stuck with Qualcomm's hardware support model. Randroid Or you can get an iPhone and Apple will EOL it for you by pushing an update that cripples the device. Which one's better? Getting a device-crippling update, or no update? Jeremy Reger like which one? my sons iphone 5 (sept 2012) is my development phone.. works like a charm Randroid http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/13/apple-new-iphones_n_5967626.html Duder12 What fragmentation? U mean not having iMessage where your text messages are high jacked? Jeremy Reger dude.. im an fanboi too.. but if you don't see fragmentation right now you will Duder12 I asked u a question. U did not answer? It's not googles fault Qualcomm refuses to port new Android to old processors. Which is exactly why Google is designing their own processors. Đức Thành He didn't answer your question because he had no idea how to answer, lol "dude.. im an fanboi too.. but if you don't see fragmentation right now you will" See, I don't hate it when people complain, if the complaints are legit. But sometimes it sure does feel like people are just complaining for the sake of complaining, just so they could feel like they are in the right about something. I feel like a radical right now... But honestly I'm beginning to start disliking the idea that "people should achieve a certain level of awareness of something before they could be allowed to have an opinion about it" a little bit less. Jeremy Reger I should have known better than to comment in the first place.. not getting into a battle.. I do develop applications and I didn't see a question that needed answered. It seemed rhetorical.. Have a great day guys Clayton Ginther Whine whine whine. Fragmentation only affects developers, and if you are one then there's nothing you can do about it. Randroid It's honestly not even that bad for developers. With the support library, Google makes it easy to support all versions with little to no effort. jonzey231 Download links seem to work for everything except the 6P. Badouken Of course they all work but the 6P... *eyes roll*. Google WHY. jonzey231 It's live now! J_Grouchy Focus on power management and notifications... Isn't that what they say EVERY year? I swear it is... abqnm They have to gradually reign things in from the wild west days of early versions of Android. They can't drop support for every single battery draining tactic in one go, as it would break too many apps and require huge developer changes. By doing things gradually, you don't piss off all your app developers and customers when they get the new version of Android and nothing works like it did before and half their apps are broken. Portzblitz And every year they do. prwnd Holy s! After 10 years they will solve the audio latency issue!!! Cant wait the initial tests! I hope new hardware won't be necessary EmirSc i want this inside me VAVAMk_2 Your mom said something along those lines to me ;) VAVAMk_2 7.1.2 beta seems kinda pointless now. jonzey231 Literally exactly what I thought. I was pumped to flash it yesterday to get the gestures, which were more annoying than useful. So I've already gone back to LOS with Magisk all configured and ready to go and then I see this. Lol. 6P download link isn't working at the moment anyways so I'll probably do it tonight, then it'll end up being ridiculously buggy with even worse battery life than the 6P already has and then I'll end up back on 7.1.1 stock. Rinse and repeat when the next preview comes out lol. VAVAMk_2 Imma do O preview on my 6P when it hits beta channel. jonzey231 6P preview image is live. VAVAMk_2 I know but it is in a rougher alpha stage now with more bugs n such. Besnik Rrustemi Like who the hell will beta test it now :D while we can test Android O Michael Oghia Orange creme pop Oreo Orange cake Oblaat Orange jelly candy Ontbijtkoek Oatmeal raisin cookie Ozark pudding Oliebol Ox-tongue pastry Orange whip Oladyi...

Einstein Brains O inside O inside O: Google design 2017 Danny365 Meh, I'm not exactly excited about these changes so far. Sounds like a minor update, 7.2. Duder12 I think I found your post from last year about nougat. Martin Another version, that most people (like 90%) wont get on their devices because Android still SUCKS! First fix the device fragmentation, then release new Versions! Make all OEMs to sell devices with Stock Android, and IF they want to have a skin to make it as a LAUNCHER that will be updated from the Google store! This way updating the phones will be 10000 easier! ;) Duder12 Buy a fucking pixel and stop being a whiny bitch. Problem solved. Cheers mate Martin Why I have to buy this crap? I like to have a skin (but not the way it's made right now). My Camera app on Huawei P9 is 1000 times better than your stupid Pixel app. So stop acting like a smart b*tch and keep your dumb suggestions for yourself ;-) Problem not solved, MATE :) Sir_Brizz Email your complaints to Huawei, then. Duder12 Hilarious u think Android could work like this. You should have bought a Google phone. You fucked up and can only blame yourself. Đức Thành I never thought it possible to be throwing around direct insults and still be passive-aggressive at the same time (on top of being entirely wrong about something and remaining completely ignorance of that wrongness, but that's a separate thing). I stand corrected and proceed to add another one to the blocked list. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Android was NEVER intended to be just stock. That was the point. Google never wanted that. It wouldn't be anywhere near as popular without skins. If you want updates buy a Pixel or Nexus. There's no other option. The process will never be fixed. Sir_Brizz I hate to break it to you but most consumers don't care about getting updates to their phones. Martin They don't care because they don't know how better is with iOS, and what they are missing. Because Android sucks in this area from the beginning. I recently switched from iOS to Android and this is total crap. My phone ain't getting Security patches, the Nougat took forever to come and it's 7.0, no app shortcuts which are very useful.. It's my own opinion. :) Bob Omb Stop buying shit phones. Nexus/Pixel or nothing. Duder12 Your an idiot for going from iOS to a non Google Android phone. Your own dumb fault for buying a Samsung, LG, etc. Martin You are idiot because you are angry missed opportunity for abortions that is releasing his anger on internet... Sad story. :) Rod It's Google's fault for allowing this to happen. SeanPR11 Please go back to iOS. Martin Wow, what a great response... IQ -10 :) SeanPR11 Wow, you are PERFECT for iOS. Martin At least perfect for something, not a total failure like you :) Sir_Brizz Most consumers also don't care on iOS. They update because they are told to, not because they care about updating. Still, you're complaining in the wrong place. The people who manufactured your cellphone are responsible for keeping it updated. If they are not doing that, then you should complain to them. If they continue to not update it, then you should switch to a different manufacturer if it is a big deal to you. As a consumer, this is the only power you have over a massive corporation. Even then it is minuscule for these large corporations, which is to say that you have almost no power over them whatsoever. Sir_Brizz Also, let me know when Apple posts something that is as open as this: https://www.blog.google/topics/connected-workspaces/diverse-protections-diverse-ecosystem-android-security-2016-year-review/ Fresh360 I love and hate your comment; I love it because the stock with manufacturer skin in the Play Store is an excellent idea one that I believe is the perfect compromise...I hate it because fragmentation is a way of life with mobile OS's not just Android. The facts of the matter is differing hardware make new software upgrades unattainable, and this isn't just an Android occurrence, Apple states their phones are on the latest iOS but certain hardware will lack certain features, so is the phone really upgraded? Đức Thành Good point. Rod iOS has no fragmentation. Curt Night Mode? Duder12 Night mode was in Nougat on pixel line. jonzey231 Not for the 6P..or 5X..or N6. Dfigs23 I downloaded the image .zip file, can I install this with Nexus Toolkit to a stock 5X on Beta?

Uchop af That white 'O' logo.. the white cream filling in Oreo??🤔🕵️ Khaled Taleb preview available for download now https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html Shelly-Man Vol 2 O! What a time to be alive. ahnafm Don't install it on the 5x! It has LG Bootloop 3.0 Beta and will brick every single device without fail when it's officially released! Kamran Mackey That is literally not funny. ahnafm Why? The Android 7.1.1 update came with Bootloop 2.1 technology. The changelog wasn't stated but i was pretty sure it was made to brick more devices. Fair enough my 5x bricked 3 days after the update! The best update Google and LG has ever made. What's even better google is taking it to the next level by downgrading Nexus 6's to 7.0. Never before seen on ANY android device! Kamran Mackey No, Android 7.1.1 didn't come with no "Bootloop 2.1" bullshit. That's a fault of LG and ONLY LG. LG always makes devices that bootloop. Don't go blaming Google for this as this is LG's fault, not Google's. Also, stop being sarcastic, you aren't fit for it. ahnafm That's why it is called "LG" Bootloop, Google basically secretly put it in their phones and hidden it as much as possible. ;) sachouba Great! Touchwiz 2014! Đức Thành Holy crap Holy crap Holy crap I guess one could say that I'm a little excited. Holy crap. Abbas Mustafa Bhaiji Can the devs finally fix the auto fill 8.8.8.8 dns in wifi static IP? Matt Isaacs Its google, and its their DNS server... Can you add your own DNS info if you wanted to? disqusdeeznuts Oh wow, power management! Oh wait, that's been their "focus" for years... Mike That's what I was thinking as well when I read it. It seems like the past two or three Android releases have specifically mentioned better power management and it never makes that much of a difference. Samadroid AptX and Pro Audio sounds pretty nice. It would also be cool to see proper usb dac support (pass-through without any upsampling) in Android. Jordan L Well, there goes the rest of my day.... (in a good way). e_hekuta HDR for apps, but not for S.O. :'( SIGTRAP You mean stock Android doesn't support AptX? Seriously!?? What the shit!? Samsung and pretty much every OEM has had this for years..... kim schulz AptX is under license and not opensource. It will not be part of Android anytime soon. LDAC will be part of O though, but just the encoder side so the decoder side will still have to pay a license fee to get it . rgl168 Meanwhile I'm still waiting for Nougat... (MXPE) Bru [971] "There's also a new windowing feature for apps to use a native overlay window instead of a system alert" So...Messenger's chat heads won't need this un-swipable notification on Android O?

Geoff Johnson Developer Previews are always just Nexus/Pixel devices. cvm My Optimus one is running now Android O beta3 so I'm pretty sure that it will come to your phone. rockstarr27 Is there any screenshots after flashing to show the UI changes?? Amine Dave Burke : The usual caveats apply: it's early days, there are more features coming, and there's still plenty of stabilization and performance work ahead of us. But it's booting :) Ygor Cortes "Wide-gamut color for apps: Android developers of imaging apps can now take advantage of new devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. To display wide gamut images, apps will need to enable a flag in their manifest (per activity) and load bitmaps with an embedded wide color profile (AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, etc.)." O - MY - GOD! FINALLY! abqnm The notification channels sounds splendid! No longer will we have to choose between disabling all notifications from an app and getting inundated with tons of spam messages you don't want. Assuming developers don't just say F*k it and use a single notification channel to keep their app exactly like it was, that is. I someday look forward to not having to choose between hiding the VPN notification and missing all other Android System notifications. Hopefully Google will follow their own recipe and take advantage of these at the OS level. Impulse_Vigil It sounds... Interesting, the implementation could be anything. TechGuy22 nothing exciting Maleko Well still good to know that I can keep the 6P if they don't release a worthy replacement for it this year...The Pixel just didn't impress me enough. Wadup Will Galaxy S7 (Exynos) get Android O? Renan Seriously? Edit: did you missed the '/s' at the end? Wadup I'm serious :( Renan God f*cking dammit, then. Already asking for this when we barely have a release date for the OS itself? Shame on you. Impulse_Vigil Do we have a release date for O? Cakefish August or September Impulse_Vigil I was being flippant... Thx tho! Cakefish In 2018, yes. pallzoltan The real question is: DOES IT LOOK DIFFERENT? matteventu The real question is: DOES HE LOOK LIKE A BITCH? 😂😂😂😂 enrico meloni #APKplz TheCarlosFontes Reading this made me miss my Pixel XL. I hope it's in stock sooner rather than later. JG And so the Great DDoS 2017 of Android Police has begun... Round 1 will probably last 48-72hours as hundreds of thousands of geeks (myself included) refresh the site like mad hopping to get a new article about some great new feature of Android O... Then there will be a 2 month pause... Then BAM, Round 2, the i/o round... JD Ah Power Management Every year a new promise, and every year a promise broken. Akash This is soo big "O" I want to eat this "O"----"Oreo" :p :p :p PVL_93_RU Holy crap, they sure dropped the bomb early. And 2 months prior to I/O This makes me thing what's I/O's big thing going to be Maybe Andromeda actually exists? hzd Wait wait . . . . Android O they say with the same promises as when N and M and L started funny here i'm sure O will be as amazing as how boring as M/N was aka not very How about google fix their buggy google now on the current release, slowly loosing faith in google. inb4 Dark UI comments ! Meh LDAC is the thing i want more than anything on that list. I have some LDAC headphones, and when i paired them up to a Sony phone i borrowed, there was a massive audio improvement over aptx. It's great to see this coming to all Nexus and pixels, and aptx as a fallback is good too. Rob Someone who downloaded Android O that could go into Settings --> Backup & Restore and bring a printscreen for me? I want to see what it looks like. Wonder if it will be all the same as in Nougat. Will sms messages be backed up eventually​? Having my hopes up Meh Sony has contributed more than 30 feature enhancements including the LDAC codec and 250 bug fixes to Android O. Cassidy James Blaede Sony built Pixel devices for 2017?! Sir_Brizz Pfft. If only. This is probably just Sony's ongoing effort to make their devices 100% AOSP compatible. ddevito Looking forward to 0.1% market share by April 2018! Cakefish As an owner of a Galaxy S7 running Nougat there really doesn't seem to be much new in O. Best feature seems to be the background limiting of apps, that's something Android should have had years ago and can't come soon enough. Other than that there's not much to get excited over. At least I'll be able to keep most of the good stuff in Grace UX when I upgrade to the Pixel (2017). ScratchC Is Android now capable of Audio production? Audio latency is still bad on yhe current version Arqum Younus Was just searching about android o, and whats new in it. This blog helped a lot.

The internet giant released a research ‘magazine’ called It’s Lit: A guide to what teens think is cool, looking at what Generation Z – defined as those aged 13-17 – consider cool. It found that YouTube, which was acquired by Google in 2006, is the number one coolest company, followed by Netflix, then the search engine behemoth itself. *Full disclosure* Yahoo didn’t fare too well in the study – teenagers think we’re one of the least cool brands out of the 122 included. But at least they think we’re cooler than Vice… MORE: Cancer warning for posh crisps MORE: Robots are going to take so many jobs we’ll need a ‘human job quota’, report suggests The magazine defined cool as something ‘unique, impressive, interesting, amazing or awesome’, or that ‘brings joy or happiness or is unique enough to stand out from everything.’ Teenage males are more likely to be persuaded that something is cool by fads or friends, whereas females are more likely to decided whether something is cool according to how it makes them feel, according to the survey. View photos Brand coolness according to Google (Google)More Google asked more than 1,000 teens to rank 122 companies according to how coolness and brand awareness.

If kids are so smart how come they have to go to school? Case closed, losers. — Mike Bird (@Birdyword) April 3, 2017 Further results from the survey found that teenagers don’t consider money to be cool, rating it below nature, fashion and books on the coolness scale.

Google Posts are a way for brands and personalities to share information in more real time within the knowledge panel in search. Here is an example of Google Posts now showing for the [new your mets] (yes, I am also a Jets fan, sad - sad life). You can see above the roster are posts from the official New York Mets social team as they posted over here - an extension from Google+. RankRanger spotted this and posted about it on Twitter. This isn't new, they just expanded it. It was first introduced with the elections and debate and then we even saw GIFs in them, which is still supported. In any event, we will see how much further Google expands Google Posts, they do plan to keep expanding it over time. Forum discussion at Twitter.

We think it targeted low value content with ad generation techniques. But Fred wasn't the only algorithm released and updated around that time, there were others. Google also confirmed working on algorithms that demote offensive, insulting and hateful content in the search results. We don't need to worry that machines will take over the ranking algorithm. Which is a good thing, because then Google really can't deny an update now. Google did call out a link seller and mock PBNs this month. But they also treated webmasters to a Google Dance, so all good. Here is last months recap if you missed it and here are the most important Google webmaster related stories we covered in the past month or so: Google Algorithm Updates: Google Fred Update Targets Ad Heavy, Low Value Content Sites Google Has Now Confirmed The Fred Algorithm Update Google Fred Algorithm Confirmed & Cites Overall Quality Issues Google Fred Update: Big Google Algorithm Update Links Related Large Google Algorithm Ranking Update: Black Hat Related?

Google did give you this information previously as a featured snippet form, not in the local box, but now it seems to be part of the local box. Sergey Alakov posted it on Twitter and Mike Blumenthal agreed that some of this is new since the past few weeks. I think the new part is that it is now directly in the local knowledge panel.

Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Most people who search on Google, share on Facebook and shop on Amazon have never heard of Sir Tim-Berners-Lee. But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year’s recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing’s version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. WATCH: The World Wide Web turns 25 Story continues below “It’s a crowning achievement,” Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help.” The honour comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee’s efforts to make the internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video – everything, really, beyond plain text – online. READ MORE: The World Wide Web turns 25: How it changed everything SPINNING THE WEB Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world’s first website, http://info.cern.ch . Besides coming up with the web’s technical specifications, Berners-Lee “offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole,” said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he’d laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. CAUGHT IN THE WEB The web’s widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the U.S. and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the web will become less accessible in the U.S. if the Federal Communicat ion Commission dismantles regulations protecting “net neutrality.” That’s the principle that internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, “it’s going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realize it’s important,” Berners-Lee said. “It allowed America to benefit from a thriving internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America.” Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a “recurrent threat.” He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn’t have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is “really important to the future of society,” he says. “As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person.” READ MORE: 3 scientists win Nobel Prize in chemistry for world’s tiniest machines BEYOND THE WEB Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn’t sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. “Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so It’s only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us,” Berners-Lee said. “So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences.” This is the 50th anniversary of the A.M. Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany’s codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web. © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Internet inventor Inventor of the Internet Inventor world wide web Nobel Prize Tim Berners-Lee Turing Award World Wide Web world's first website Editor's Picks Canada Rent doubles for tenants of 2 west-end Toronto condos, province says reform coming Canada Seeking Asylum: Canada a 'dreamland' for Somalis in Minneapolis Entertainment Watching TV in virtual reality: 5 things you can expect Health Will teens smoke more pot when it's legal?

In the Google v. Vedanti IPR Hearing, which was held on February 14th, 2017 in Virginia, USA, VLL’s counsel, Bob Asher from Sunstein Kann Murphy & Timbers LLP is optimistic about a favorable ruling overcoming the arguments put forth by Google’s attorneys. The Board of Judges is expected to issue its final decision sometime before May 20th, 2017. „We believe we are getting ever-closer to monetizing this incredibly valuable patent portfolio,” states Steve Hawkins, CEO of Vedanti Systems Limited and Vedanti Licensing Limited. „We will continue to pursue every legal avenue available to litigate, settle and license this technology. I invite all interested parties to carefully read the IPR hearing transcript.” Get a copy of the hearing transcript. „Our legal counsel along with the License Committee headed up by myself and John Blaisure, CEO of Max Sound Corporation, are confident that Mr. Asher leaned the needle strongly in our favor, and we believe the ‚339 patent will be upheld.” Last January, the US Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the District Court dismissing MAXD’s patent infringement lawsuit against Google for lack of standing. This order remains a mute point as it was predicated on the fact that Max Sound Corporation is now the joint co-owner (the „VLL/Max Sound Agreement”) granting the Company co-ownership of U.S. Patent No. 7,974,339 (the „`339 Patent”). Therefore, the Court’s decision does not have any affect on the merits of the infringement claims against Google. Pending a favorable outcome of the IPR Hearing, VLL and MAXD intend to file a new action as co-owners against Google for willful infringement.

But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year’s recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing’s version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. Advertisement “It’s a crowning achievement,” Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help.” The honor comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee’s efforts to make the internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video — everything, really, beyond plain text — online. Spinning the web Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world’s first website, http://info.cern.ch . Besides coming up with the web’s technical specifications, Berners-Lee “offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole,” said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he’d laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. Advertisement Caught in the web  The web’s widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the U.S. and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the web will become less accessible in the U.S. if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting “net neutrality.” That’s the principle that internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favoring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment.

Trouble continues to mount for Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer accused of stealing trade secrets when he left to start his own autonomous vehicle company, Otto, which Uber quickly bought last year for $680 million dollars. Google parent company Alphabet is currently suing Uber, alleging that the ride-hailing giant broke the law when Levandowski handed over proprietary LiDAR sensor technology. A potential injunction against Uber’s use of the tech could prove devastating to the $68 billion company as it seeks to replace its current workforce with a driverless fleet. Now, it turns out the claims against Levandowski are even more far-reaching than previously reported. According to arbitration demand documents from last year that were just made available to the public, Levandowski was also clandestinely working on other, competing self-driving start-ups for years before he left Alphabet. One, Odin Wave, was registered to an address in Berkeley belonging to Levandowski. A supplier contacted Google in 2013 to let the company know they’d received a request for a custom part closely resembling one used by Google. (Levandowski has denied any wrongdoing.) Odin Wave later merged with another company, Tyto Lidar, which was owned by Ognen Stojanovski, a friend of Levandowski’s, according to Tech Crunch. In 2015, Google explored the idea of working with or acquiring Tyto, given how similar their technologies were. Levandowski allegedly did not disclose his relationship to Tyto, but participated in Google’s investigation process of the company. Google claims Otto bought Tyto in 2016. “Google is now informed and believes that Levandowski had some involvement with Odin Wave/Tyto since at least 2013 at the same time that he was working on Google’s development of LiDAR sensor modules,” attorneys for Waymo, Google’s self-driving car division, reportedly said in the filing. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously dismissed Google’s allegations as baseless and has sought to move the lawsuit to private arbitration. Levandowski will reportedly invoke his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid self-incrimination. His lawyers have said he will not turn over technical documents pertaining to the case because there is a “potential for criminal action” in the ongoing case. Google employment contracts prohibit employees from recruiting co-workers right after leaving Google, according to TechCrunch. The company brought arbitration against Levandowski and another Otto co-founder, who, based on the work history provided in the arbitration documents, appears to be Lior Ron, a fellow ex-Googler who Google claims also tried to recruit company employees in violation of his employment contract. “Levandowski made concerted and repeated efforts to solicit most, if not all, of his direct reports to leave Google,” Google claims in the document, adding that the company tried to fire Levandowski after finding out about his recruitment efforts in 2015. But the company couldn’t confirm details, and decided not to terminate him. Meanwhile, the document states, Levandowski collected $120 million in incentive pay from Google.

Solicitors, accountants and retailers were among delegates at the event organised by the Mercury's digital team at the National Space Centre. Speakers explained how, despite the growth of new technology and search engine optimisation, many businesses were still failing to exploit the potential marketing opportunities offered by Google. They were told about improving their digital visibility, gaining customer insights from search data, and how to understand the benefits of advertising with Google. Everyone who attended received a digital health check report. Kerry Clarridge, head of digital sales for Mercury parent company Trinity Mirror in the East Midlands, headed up the breakfast event. She said most of the attendees signed up for a no obligation consultation with the team and the chance to redeem a £100 voucher against a potential advertising campaign. Ms Clarridge was joined by brothers Kunal, Kevin and Savan Dattani, who run Mo Bros men's grooming in Oadby – who spoke about how they are now advertising their online products worldwide.

The new Google Maps location sharing can share your location via links Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 2:48pm PDTMar 28, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Applications Google News Google started rolling out the new location sharing feature in Google Maps today, which is vastly more streamlined than the old method. You can share your location with a contact, of course, but there's more to it. You can also create links that share your location, and they come with all the same controls as contact sharing. To create a link, simply set the length of time you want your location shared and pick an app. Choosing a contact simply connects directly to their account, but using the "More" button at the bottom (or the shortcut next to it) creates a link. They're all "maps.app.goo.gl" URLs. You can do whatever you want with the link—email it, share it in a message, even tweet it. I don't know why you would do that, but you can. The links are managed just like connections to contacts. You can deactivate them at any time and view the current status in Maps. Each one is also unique, so you can set different lengths of time for different links. It's a bit similar to the photo sharing links built into Google Photos. Neat, right?

It is now enabled for me. In the UK. The app never updated. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, it's a server side change. Total Insecurity I think you can force it, though. Here in Germany in German language I got it by doing the following: "[On my other phone] it could get activated by signing out and in again. Then you need to press the new widget and it should appear. Maybe try deleting a your cache like I did before as well! All you need to do is: Go to widgets in Android, add and click on the share location widget​." Dirge LOL. No need to jump through hoops. Just clear google map's cache and force stop, then open it again and viola! It is there. Total Insecurity Not everyone made that experience, I think. But you could be right, though. :) Ian Kumlien If you select settings from the three buttons on the right side, you can select which circles to share with but the settings can't be saved apparently demarcmj That is probably a remnant from G+. When I first went to that settings page yesterday, it complained at me that I needed a G+ profile. But today that went away and it's working. I imagine that circle sharing will probably go away entirely. Shaques So if you're sharing via a contact and not a link, that person needs to have Google Maps installed on their device (mainly thinking iOS) for it to work properly otherwise they apparently receive an email. Midas Gordon-Farleigh I think they'll need to be logged into their Google account too, obviously. I have many contacts that I can invite that definitely use Google maps, but haven't logged in - more particularly on iOS where it's not linked to the OS. Morten Ulv Just tested, no need to be logged in. JG Does it work on the web as well? If so iOS (and the few WP users) could access your location via maps.google.com via their web browser of choice without having to install Google Maps app... bulletmark Location sharing in the G+ app was poorly implemented and the web view was hopeless. This new native implementation in Maps seems to work great though, both on mobile and the web. F4LL0U7 Yeah even Latitude wasn't implemented so well. Let's hope this is something they stick with, and don't abandon it like they tend to do. demarcmj Agree, but Latitude was at least implemented better than G+ Rod Just got it. (Brazil) http://i.imgur.com/T13JaqD.png Carson Saldanha Before us US folks? Unacceptable! /s Rod Haters gonna hate. Dirge I'm in the US and I got it around Noon, Pacific Time. René Simonsen Would like to know how it works on the receiving end. Is that part integrated into Google Maps too? Can I share my location with an iOS user, and will he easily keep track of my location in his Google Maps app? ericshmerick iOS works as well, appeared on my iPhone a few hours ago. Should be platform independent as it's using Google's services/account to communicate. Giampi Working very well. I would like a persistent notification when sharing although. F4LL0U7 The option to have it would be good. They have that in Trusted Contacts. But for those of us who share indefinitely with a spouse, that would get annoying, so it would be good to be able to turn it off. Jennifercalvarez Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Jurij Turnšek Can you comment on battery drain when sharing location constantly? F4LL0U7 My wife and I have been sharing our locations with each other constantly since the feature launched, and we haven't noticed any impact on battery life. I don't think it's using any more power than usual. Your phone determines your exact location on a pretty regular basis anyway, assuming you have that enabled. All this feature is doing is taking that info that Google already knows, and sharing it with people of your choice. Benjamin Pavel When this activated they also turned off the G+ location sharing...that sucks as I've had my mother and my cousin on there and it seems these shared locations are not transitioning to this new system which sucks! Biff Wonsley Yeah, you're gonna have to set them up again from scratch. Oddly, my G+ location sharing widget is still working, even though location sharing in my Maps is live. I know where my wife is, she doesn't know where I am. Even though she's sitting right next to me. F4LL0U7 Sharing via a link is a great idea. Does your location have a persistent link? Like, could my wife and I bookmark each other's locations on our desktops? Or would we have to share to a link and bookmark that? codemonkey85 If it's your wife, why even deal with links if you can share directly through Google accounts? But anyway, the links you generate are persistent, same as Photos sharing links... until they are revoked. F4LL0U7 We are sharing that way, I'm just wondering if there's a permalink directly to the user's location, (if someone is sharing with you) for bookmarking purposes. demarcmj I think I saw something in the video they put out that said sharing via link was limited to a certain duration. Can't be set as "ongoing." JG They're all "maps.app.goo.gl" URLs. You can do whatever you want with the link—email it, share it in a message, even tweet it. I don't know why you would do that, but you can. A food truck might want to tweet a link to their location so fans could come get food... create812 I can imagine some people will come up with clever and creative uses of this feature. mwolverine If my wife and I share location with each other (until we turn it off), will this be a massive battery drain? Rod Yes. GPS + location download/upload Jeroen Kap My guess: no. Your smartphone updates your location by default on standard times. I think this will benefit from that information. Only when you force a refresh in Maps it will gain new location data Rod Sure about that? Because then, it won't be exactly "live" tracking.. KappadeX That (actual battery and GPS use) will be the case when you navigate. And send the ETA link to a friend. I was assuming you meant the daily location sharing. The Pool Man I have this exact question too. demarcmj No more than usual. Your phone doesn't check location any more or less than it normally would. It just shares whatever your most recent location was. The only additional battery implications are the sharing part of it, but that's not a lot of data to transfer. Tomáš Petrík I hope they will add a feature to turn on/off the layer with the contact heads on the map, just like I can turn on/off traffic, satellite, etc. Sure, when I want to check where somebody is, I will enable that and look. But I don't want the icons in the map permanently (from family members who share the location indefinitely). demarcmj Yea that'd be nice. When it was Latitude, they had it implemented as a layer, like satellite or traffic, so it could do just that. HSidhu The sad part is that you have to turn on location history. groid Is location history required to be able to use this? I know you are asked to turn it on when setting up the sharing, but does it have to stay on? I really don't want to keep location history on and I have no use for timeline or any other location history feature. HSidhu I think it should be ON all the time but you should try turning it OFF and see if it still tells you your friend's location. let us know too. Matt Terk My Maps app crashes every time I try to enable Location Sharing, either by link or through the menu. Anyone else experienced this? Wiped cache/davlik, on PureNexus 7.1.1 Shamu, I am in the beta for Maps.

Including speed and location history, it even shows the path they took. It also shows if the person in moving or not. Google might introduce all this in coming days.

The Big G funded a research to find out which brands are most popular among Generation Z and it turns out today’s teenagers think nothing is cooler than Google – not even Xbox, Playstation or Snapchat ranked as more “unique, impressive, interesting, amazing, or awesome” than Google and its products. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE While Gen Z usually refers to those born between the mid-1990s to early 2000s, the Mountain View behemoth focused on American teenagers aged 13 to 17 to reach this conclusion. The findings were published in an equally cool-titled ‘magazine’ called It’s Lit: A guide to what teens think is cool. As the team behind the holy GBook of Cool explains, the survey was compiled to offer insight into what brands teenagers religiously pay attention to and get most excited about. The data provided reflects a sample of 1,100 teens and 122 brands. “Unlike millennials,” the study found Gen Z’ers are “ambitious, engaged, and feel like they can change the world” which is why it was so important to pinpoint what the young leaders of tomorrow find cool – that and the $44 billion purchasing power they hold. YouTube – which is owned by Google – and Netflix topped the charts as the two coolest and most recognized services among Gen Z, followed by Google in the number three spot. Click to zoom. While brands like Facebook, Yahoo and AT&T were pretty well-known, teens didn’t deem them particularly cool. In fact, Yahoo was among the four ‘least cool’ brands, accompanied by Sprint, TMZ and The Wall Street Journal. Vice wasn’t that cool either, coming in near the tail end along with The Wall Street Journal. Least known among Gen Z were clothing brands Uniqlo, Patagonia and Supreme, as well as home automation giant Nest. The research further indicated that while millennials tend to have a preference for Playstation, teenagers would much rather game on Xbox. As far as coolest games go, The Legend of Zelda was the most popular title among Z’ers, ranking ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops and Grant Theft Auto. Pokemon, Minecraft and Counter Strike: GO completed the list. Curiously, The Legend of Zelda was spelled wrong in the report. Typos, Google? Not cool. The most used social media platform for 13 to 17 year olds was Instagram, with almost 60 percent of all teenagers having signed up for the service. Snapchat and Facebook completed the top three with  56.4 and 52.8 percent each. Interestingly, the study found that Gen Z’ers used Google+ more often than Twitter and Instagram – though that’s hardly surprising given Google’s undeniable coolness. While Google is usually trustworthy, this one made me raise an eyebrow.

The federal lawsuit was originally filed in Michigan last December by the estates of three victims, but it was amended last week to include ten more plaintiffs. The complaint accuses the two social media sites, the video-sharing platform and the world’s most popular search engine of allowing ISIS to share content that allegedly inspired Omar Mateen. He opened fire inside the packed Pulse nightclub in Orlando on the night of June 12, 2016, killing 49 people and injuring 68 others before he was shot dead by police. Scroll down for video  More than a dozen families, estates and survivors of the Pulse nightclub mass shooting are suing multiple social media companies for allegedly contributing to the radicalization of the ISIS-inspired gunman Extremist: Omar Mateen (left and right) opened fire inside the packed Pulse nightclub in Orlando on the night of June 12, 2016, killing 49 people and injuring 68 others Faces of carnage: This photo combination shows victims of the Pulse mass shooting.

Bottom row from left are: Juan Chavez Martinez, Jerald Arthur Wright, Jean Carlos Nieves Rodriguez, Akyra Murray, Deonka Deidra Drayton, Cory James Connell and Alejandro Barrios Martinez In late March, more than a dozen Pulse victims or their families filed another lawsuit against G4S, the security firm where Mateen worked as a guard, and against the killer's wife, Noor. Among the new plaintiffs in the social media lawsuit is Christine Leinonen, the mother of deceased victim Christopher 'Dru' Leinonen, who has emerged as an outspoken anti-gun violence advocate in the wake of the deadly rampage. ‘I think this is one lawsuit that may actually work, so that we could prevent some future tragedies,’ she told the Orlando Sentinel. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Sushi chef suicide bomber patrolled St Petersburg for two... Muslim convert charged with beheading his co-worker in... Share this article Share In case of a legal victory, Mrs Leinonen plans to give all the money from the lawsuit to the foundation she has started in memory of her son, The Dru Project, which promotes gay-straight alliances in schools. ‘Even if the damages are minimal, that’s irrelevant. I have the opportunity to eradicate future evil. That would promote my son’s honor, his name, his legacy,’ Leinonen said. The civil suit seeks a federal judge to declare that the social media sites have violated the Anti-Terrorism Act by allowing ISIS supporters to use the Internet services and disseminate extremist content. Twitter, Google and Facebook have filed a motion to dismiss the federal lawsuit. Plaintiff: Among the plaintiffs in the social media lawsuit is Christine Leinonen, the mother of deceased victim Christopher 'Dru' Leinonen (pictured together)  Sued: The newly amended federal lawsuit names (clockwise) Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube as defendants in the civil case   The complaint contends that Mateen was radicalized by ISIS's use of sites like Facebook and Twitter, but the companies have argued that the lawsuit fails to show any evidence that the attack was 'in any way impacted, helped by, or the result of ISIS's presence on the social networks.' The legal action brought by the families of nine deceased victims and four survivors of the carnage in Orlando makes mention of the widely reported fact that Omar Mateeen went on Facebook during the rampage, but it does not cite any specific examples of the gunman watching ISIS videos online. Two weeks ago, attorneys for 61 Pulse victims and family members of those killed filed another lawsuit in state court in Palm Beach County, Florida, against Omar Mateen’s former employer and his widow, blaming them for failing to prevent the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The lawsuit accused the security firm that hired Mateen of ignoring his comments supporting violence prior to the rampage. Another lawsuit was filed in March against Mateen's widow, Noor Salman (pictured in family photo) and his former employer  The complaint also claimed that Noor Salman conspired in the attack by assisting her husband with his purchase of firearms and surveillance of the Pulse nightclub. She faces federal charges of aiding and abetting her husband and obstructing justice by lying to authorities. G4S Secure Solutions said in a statement it planned to ‘vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit which it considers to be wholly without merit.’ Noor Salman’s attorney said his client has pleaded not guilty and has denied responsibility for her husband’s actions.  Read more: Twitter, Facebook targeted by more Pulse shooting victims - Orlando Sentinel Share or comment on this article e-mail 26 shares Most watched News videos What happened when we sent a female reporter to catcall men?

In the Google v. Vedanti IPR Hearing, which was held on February 14th, 2017 in Virginia, USA, VLL's counsel, Bob Asher from Sunstein Kann Murphy & Timbers LLP is optimistic about a favorable ruling overcoming the arguments put forth by Google's attorneys. The Board of Judges is expected to issue its final decision sometime before May 20th, 2017. "We believe we are getting ever-closer to monetizing this incredibly valuable patent portfolio," states Steve Hawkins, CEO of Vedanti Systems Limited and Vedanti Licensing Limited. "We will continue to pursue every legal avenue available to litigate, settle and license this technology. I invite all interested parties to carefully read the IPR hearing transcript." Get a copy of the hearing transcript. "Our legal counsel along with the License Committee headed up by myself and John Blaisure, CEO of Max Sound Corporation, are confident that Mr. Asher leaned the needle strongly in our favor, and we believe the '339 patent will be upheld." Last January, the US Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the District Court dismissing MAXD's patent infringement lawsuit against Google for lack of standing. This order remains a mute point as it was predicated on the fact that Max Sound Corporation is now the joint co-owner (the "VLL/Max Sound Agreement") granting the Company co-ownership of U.S. Patent No. 7,974,339 (the "`339 Patent"). Therefore, the Court's decision does not have any affect on the merits of the infringement claims against Google. Pending a favorable outcome of the IPR Hearing, VLL and MAXD intend to file a new action as co-owners against Google for willful infringement.

Find out how you can avoid the same mistakes. Web users are not patient. The speed of your site can make a massive difference to whether people will visit your site, whether they’ll stay on it, and whether they will come back. Not to mention whether they’ll make a purchase. A massive 79% of shoppers who have been disappointed by a site’s performance say that they’re less likely to use the site again. But what constitutes ‘disappointed’? We’re only human after all Kissmetrics research on customer reactions to site speed has resounded across the industry, but it’s not something that should be forgotten: “If an e-commerce site is making $100,000 per day, a 1 second page delay could potentially cost you $2.5 million in lost sales every year.” That’s a 7% reduction in your conversion rate, and 52% of customers say site speed is a big factor in their site loyalty. A one second delay is bad – a two second delay is worse. 47% of consumers expect web pages to load within two seconds. But based on the same research, a faster full-site load leads to a 34% lower bounce rate, and an improvement by just one second results in a 27% conversion rate increase. It’s because site speed is such a vital part of building a successful ecommerce site that my team at Kaizen and I conducted a study into 700 top UK ecommerce sites, analyzing various aspects of their site speed performance. What we found is that the biggest brands have some of the poorest optimization, with outdated web protocols, unresponsive pages, and bloated page size. The average web page size is now 2.3MB (that’s the size of the shareware version of the classic game Doom), so we wanted to see whether the ecommerce industry is any better – since their businesses are directly dependent on their website performance. Surprisingly, we have found that the web page size of the top UK ecommerce sites is 30% larger on average than standard websites – at 2.98 MB. Average webpage size according to HTTPArchive However, the web page size isn’t the only factor impacting the site speed. Even larger sites load and render quickly if they’re smart about how they deliver. My team and I picked the top 700 UK ecommerce sites, based on their estimated monthly traffic with data kindly supplied by SimilarWeb. For each, we analysed them using Google’s PageSpeed Insights API, checked their page size and loading time on Pingdom, and verified their HTTP protocol using https://http2.pro/. From this, we found the following data, and used it to determine which websites are best optimised for speed: PageSpeed Insights Desktop Score (not considering third party data) PageSpeed Insights Mobile Score (not considering third party data) HTTP/2 Web page size Loading Time Loading Time per MB Desktop vs mobile Mobile connections are usually slower than desktop to begin with, so further delays are felt even more keenly. This, together with the fact that Google’s latest mobile update now factors site speed into mobile page ranking, makes it a high value consideration to ensure mobile pages are sufficiently optimized. This becomes even more of a consideration when you factor in how much of ecommerce traffic is now mobile – for example Vodafone, the third top-scoring website in our recent research, receives only 20% of their traffic from desktop, with 80% coming from mobile devices. Make your site work for you Your site speed isn’t simply a dial you can turn up in your page settings; there are a number of factors which contribute to it. here’s what they are, and how you can start making your site one of the fastest out there. Protocol power HTTP/1.1 isn’t SPDY enough Network protocols are the rules and standards that govern the end points in a telecommunication connection – how data is transmitted over the web. Common examples include IP – Internet Protocol – and HTTP – Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The HTTP/1.1 protocol is decades old and doesn’t make full use of newer technologies. Its main downside is it doesn’t allow you to download files in parallel. For each file (or request), the server needs a separate connection. HTTP/1.1 enables only one request per connection, while browsers now support a maximum of 6 connections per domain. This means that the number of files which can be downloaded and rendered simultaneously is limited – and that costs time. Since the time of HTTP/1.1, Google has developed a newer version of the protocol, SPDY (“Speedy”), which allows simultaneous connections to be opened, and means it can serve multiple parts of the website (JavaScript, HTML, images, etc.) in parallel. But SPDY isn’t the latest protocol developed by Google. Working closely with W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), they’ve developed the new HTTP/2 protocol. HTTP/2 has roughly the same characteristics as SPDY, but is also binary, and allows the server to ‘push’ information to the requester, with better HPACK compression. Despite the clear advantages of the HTTP/2 protocol, only a few websites have made use of it. Our recent research discovered that only 7.87% of the top 700 ecommerce sites use the technology – compared to 11.3% of sites overall. Some examples of websites using HTTP/2 are https://www.vans.co.uk/, https://www.paperchase.co.uk/ or https://www.expedia.co.uk/. According to Cloudflare.com, when they implemented HTTP/2, they saw customers’ average page load time nearly halved – from 9.07 seconds for HTTP/1.X falling to 4.27 seconds for HTTP/2. That’s a significant improvement in a key area of website efficiency. However, HTTP/2 doesn’t solve everything, and in some cases the results can be disappointing. In our research, many websites achieved only very small speed gains in their loading times when served over HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/1.1. Switching to HTTP/2 isn’t enough by itself – many websites fail to optimize for the change and lose out on the maximum speed gains. Old-school techniques, such as domain sharding or sprites, can be counter-productive. And using huge CSS or JavaScript files where less than 10% of the rules and code is relevant to pages likely to be visited is a waste of both your user’s time and your server’s time. Screenshot from Dareboost comparison analysis of Oliver Bonas’ loading performance Even our own measurements showed that the average loading time per 1 MB for websites supporting HTTP/2 was 1.74s, compared to 1.44s for websites not supporting HTTP/2. A nice example of a successful HTTP/2 optimisation is Paperchase, who saved a full second of time necessary to load their website, as is shown here: Screenshot from Dareboost comparison analysis of Paperchase loading performance How To Tackle Protocols – HTTP/2 and you If you want to be at the forefront of network protocols – and at the top of the list of faster sites – get an HTTP/2 protocol in place. While HTTP/2 only requires the server to support the new protocol (many now do, though Microsoft’s IIS has no plans yet), the browsers need a TLS connection. This means every connection over HTTP/2 will be safe and secure, adding an extra layer of security to the internet. For more information on how you can get started with HTTP/2, have a look at the Kaizen in-depth article here.

As I mentioned earlier in this article, the ecommerce sites looked at in our study were bigger on average than other webpages out there – 30% bigger, at 2.98 MB, compared to a global standard of 2.3MB. Format, compress, minify One of the biggest issues on plus-sized websites is pictures. Unless they’re compressed and resized to suitable formats, they can be over-large and slow page speed to a crawl. The solution to that problem explains itself – compress and resize – but less obvious fixes can be found in using the appropriate file type. The .png format makes files smaller if they’re in block coloring and simple – like infographics, illustrations and icons. But for photographs, with a wide number of colors and much finer details, .png can compromise the quality of the image. You might consider using .jpg files instead, or .WebP, an open source image type format from Google, which supports both lossy and lossless compression. Using correctly sized, unscaled images manually can be quite a daunting task for web developers. PageSpeed modules from Google can come in handy, automating many of the tasks necessary for site speed optimization. You can also minify the source codes. CSS and JavaScript resources could be minified using tools like http://javascript-minifier.com/ and http://cssminifier.com/ – and should save kilobytes otherwise spent on whitespace. The HTML should be also as compact as possible. We recommend stripping out all the unnecessary whitespace and empty lines. Time to go mobile Not very responsive Most retailers in the study had mobile-optimized sites, but 24% of them served their mobile users a separate mobile site – usually on a separate sub domain. While this approach improves UX, it can be inconvenient for two reasons: 1)    Google handles subdomains as separate domains. 2)    Depending on how the redirects based on viewport are set up, in the new, mobile-first index world, this can mean that the Googlebot (visiting with smartphone user agent) will have troubles reaching the desktop version of the site. A safer solution can be to use a responsive site that delivers the same HTML code to all devices, but adapts to the size and shape of the device used. We found that this had representation on only 76% of the sites. Alarmingly, mobile sites themselves were largely poorly-optimized for mobile; the average mobile site scored 53.9/100 for speed, as opposed to the average desktop score of 59.4/100. Hewlett Packard had a massive difference of 29 points between their desktop score (at 77/100) and their mobile (48/100), while the worst offenders were Carat London, who scored zero for both mobile and desktop score. Here is the list of the top 10 websites based on Google’s Page Speed Insights: URL Desktop Score Mobile Score Total PageSpeed Score http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/ 97 95 192 http://www.ikea.com 95 88 183 http://www.vodafone.co.uk 83 99 182 http://www.findmeagift.co.uk/ 92 85 177 http://www.wynsors.com/ 89 88 177 http://www.sofasworld.co.uk/ 90 86 176 http://www.americangolf.co.uk/ 80 95 175 http://www.mulberry.com/ 88 86 174 http://www.worldstores.co.uk/ 89 85 174 https://forbiddenplanet.com/ 90 84 174 Mobile management Much of the mobile optimization requires coding and/or web development skills, but worry not – Google have created a guide to delivering a mobile page in under a second. AMP it up AMP – Accelerated Mobile Pages – is Google’s initiative for producing more efficient webpages for mobile. It’s a work-in-progress, but every day brings new developments and more support, customization and stability. AMP pages have a number of benefits for all sites, including being preferred by Google in search rankings, and being faster to load. For ecommerce it’s a technology to implement ASAP, or at least keep an eye on. While AMP debuted for publishing sites, recent updates have brought ecommerce sites into the fold, and eBay in particular have been quick on the uptake, now serving over eight million pages through the AMP system. Google is also working with eBay on things like A/B testing and smart buttons. “With items like these in place, AMP for ecommerce will soon start surfacing,” says Senthil Padmanabhan, the principal engineer of eBay. Customization on ecommerce AMP pages is currently low, but it’s an ideal technology for the industry, allowing customers quicker transitions between products – improving conversion rates and making the website easy to use. During testing on the websites in our study, AMP was found to have a 71% faster load speed for blog posts, and a reduced page size from 2.3MB to 632kB. Onwards and upwards Site speed isn’t a problem that’s going to go away. As time goes by, the technology improves – AMP and HTTP/2 are just the latest steps on the road to real-time loading. 5G is on the horizon, and customers are only going to become less patient with slow-loading pages. As a result, it’s increasingly necessary to keep an eye on your site analytics and your customer behavior. A speed improvement of just one second can improve your conversion rate by 27% – and a delay of one second can cost you millions a year. Make sure you’re on top of bringing your ecommerce business and site into the modern era with the tips I’ve listed here. Pete Campbell is Managing Director at Kaizen.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Roger Siegenthaler You do know what frand is... the point of frand is so standardised systems can't be abused by the patent holders (Qualcomm)... There's nothing that apple does that should be standardised and therefore nothing they could contribute to the frand pool. Drakenoid There actually are things Apple can contribute but they don't, like their processor tech. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Funem Microsoft make money on Android phone sales due to patents. In theory they have nothing to gain from joining as they would lose they money. Syukri Lajin they are trying to put their products into android phones. and getting in good term with android makers is the first step to this. they might be losing money for the patents, but they can offset it by putting their software and services into the phone,which is also better for long term profit. the bad news for us is that we'll get more bloatware. lol Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Gerardo Sarabia Did you even read my comment? First thing I said is I know it had nothing to do with Android/PAX. YuCMi That doesn't change the validity of the rest of my comment. The beginning of your second sentence confused me, which is why I did not pick up on you saying Waymo is unrelated. Still though, your comment was completely off topic from Pax. Infringing on patents can happen involuntarily, and are more of a case of copying or reproducing. What happened with Waymo is actual theft, breaches of legal contracts, and conspiracy, among other things. Gerardo Sarabia Yeah... who cares how it happened. Either you are copying or not. Either you are open about sharing those ideas so costumers benefit from competition, or you aren't. I understand the difference, don't get me wrong, but this has been the argument Google (now Alphabet) has been giving the media and users for a long time. Now that I think about it, it actually has a lot to do with PAX, big coincidence PAX is happening now that Google is making hardware, they need freedom around those patents more than ever, not for Android but for themselves. Basically Google can get away with entering iOS/Apple's market and even use Oracle's Java in order to do so, but Uber shouldn't? I understand the difference from stealing and copying but there's clearly some conflict on these ideals. Maybe Waymo should just sue the guy that stole those files instead of Uber if that's the problem. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross.

Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel. Drakenoid I would love Android Pay with MST!!! That would be dream come true! Also fast wireless charging!!! Though I am sure Samsung doesn't hold the patent for hybrid wireless those are held by the alliances.

In a few months, there will only be one. According to an email forwarded to us by a tipster, Google has alerted GMS partners of its intention to remove Google Now Launcher from the Play Store in the coming weeks. OEMs that use GNL have options, though. The email (which you can see below) explains that the Search Launcher Services library for OEMs that has been in testing is now available. That's what Sony used to integrate the Google Now panel (now just the Google Feed) into its stock launcher a while back. That means OEMs can slap the Google Now panel on whatever launcher they want. Some device makers have been shipping with GNL, including Motorola and Nexus devices. Google says they can just grab Launcher3 from AOSP and add the search services, or build a new launcher. It's unclear what, if anything, Google will do for Nexus devices. Google plans to remove GNL from the optional GMS package on March 1st, meaning no devices with the launcher pre-installed will be approved after that. Existing devices can continue using GNL, though. It will technically still be updated via the Google app. However, the listing will go away by the end Q1 2017 (i.e. now-ish). That affects people who just installed GNL on their devices from the store. You can keep using it, but don't expect any major improvements. It would be nice if this meant the Pixel Launcher was going to be opened up to other phones, but I'm not holding my breath.

Because that would be awesome. Sathira Katugaha It already can but the library requires root access. Action launcher takes advantage of this for rooted users Cory Wilson What I don't get is why Google won't add the feature for third party launchers on the play store. I've been asking for this feature for a while teh Jax I think it's because they don't want a ton of crapware apps hooking into people's Google Now feeds and using it as yet another way to manipulate users into doing dumb things. Sashank Narayan That… is not how it works. teh Jax No? Why not? The API allows you to feed search criteria into Google Now/Feed. Search criteria both changes the immediate behavior of Google Now/Feed as well as future behavior (via "give me news articles on topics I search" or whatever that setting is). This means that you can manipulate Google Now/Feed into pulling up articles based on prior searches. But if I can input certain search criteria that matches *my* articles, then I can start to manipulate people to come to my revenue-generating sites under the false belief that Google is suggesting my articles as good and legitimate. There are LOTS of ways to manipulate people and systems and while this may not be obvious to you, it seems like an obvious way to me to manipulate people and systems. But by requiring interfacing apps to have system access, then that means the Play Store is a poor distribution channel for malicious apps such as this. But if that requirement wasn't there, then it would be open season for apps like this. If you know something I don't know, please elaborate. But from what I understand, this is exactly how this works. Sashank Narayan Where does it say that the API allows you to manipulate search criteria? Do you have a source for that? AFAIK, all the launcher integration does is to seamlessly transition between the launcher and the Google app. There's no way for the launcher to change what the Google app shows. teh Jax Changing what the Google Apps shows is indirect. It's not like they can directly put in there whatever they want. But they can trigger search criteria. And let's say I'm a Trump hater and I want to push some fake news stories, I can send search criteria like "Trump Eats Cute Puppies" to get that search indexed by Google and tied to you so that way when I publish some fake articles about Trump eating puppies, Google will say, "Hey Sashank, look what I've got for you!" via the news feed. It's a couple levels of indirection to get to the manipulation part, but it's there and I would think Google would want to avoid this. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there are other reasons for it. But that's why I suspect it's root-only access (which generally means OEM software only, for non-rooters). MJ Wait... Trump don't eat cute puppies? tekfr33kn Nope. Bernie does cuz they're free and he's all about the free sh!t. Stephen B Morris Just the ugly ones. Christopher Bement Where is the setting for this? All I can find is swipe to open the google app, but it's not built in, just opens the app. navjot It can but at a system level, which is why OEMs can do it. You can do it yourself with root but the app has to support it. I think Action Launcher is the only major one that does. zebinadams I see. But hopefully, Nova will be able to add it without having to be rooted. Since I got my 6p last month, I haven't felt the need to root my phone, and this isn't a good enough reason, if you ask me. But it would be a great addition to Nova if it can be done without root. Joe Kovacs They can't without root, that's the problem. James Warren Think it's only for OEM's since teslacoil haven't been able to implement the last developer tools for search to nova , I don't see why they will be able to this time. Ariya SD They actually could've implemented it (with root as a requirement) if they wanted to. Action Launcher 3 is proof of that. The developer just chose not to (rightfully so, IMO), and they explained why: https://plus.google.com/+KevinBarry/posts/9nQzgKAsBc3 Joseph This doesn't make much sense. If they are planning on doing this, why not let everyone use the Pixel Launcher? Installing the Google Now Launcher was a nice way of bringing some consistency (and useful features) to non-Pixel, non-Nexus devices. OEMs are slow. Do we expect them to integrate the Google Now Panel anytime soon? skillfulshoe OEMs being slow is not really Google's fault and you shouldn't blame them for it. If you want consistency and fast updates, Google seems to be telling us to buy a Pixel phone. teh Jax A year ago they said to buy a Nexus phone. This is hypocritical. Glad I have a Pixel but I feel for those who are hanging onto a N6p. I was planning on hanging onto an N6p until the TMo promotion came out allowing me to get a Pixel for $325. skillfulshoe Cancelling the launcher's updates won't destroy the N6P experience. Other launchers will get some of Google Now's features so it's not like Google is just abandoning them completely. teh Jax You are correct but it's still hypocritical/misleading by them. For the Nexus 6p, they claimed "You're always among the first to receive software and security updates" but this is clearly not that since they're abandoning the software and security updates for this software. http://www.google.com/nexus/6p/ skillfulshoe The GNL is an app technically, so that doesn't apply to this situation. Treat this as Google abandoning yet another app, not discontinuing actual software updates. The N6P will still get security updates, etc. teh Jax An app is software. And the launcher is a pretty critical part of a phone for most users. Light Exactly. The launcher is part of the software, it's part of the Google Experience Package. Google is leaving you behind, so... Classic stuff, broken promises. Joseph I'm not blaming Google for the slowness of OEMs, i'm blaming them for getting rid of the Google Now Launcher. Why get rid of a perfectly good app without a viable replacement (for most people). Telling Google Now Launcher users to buy a Pixel isn't a valid argument, imo. skillfulshoe I just said that it seems like that's what they want. If you want a Google experience, get a Pixel. Otherwise there are plenty of other 3rd party launchers to use like Nova. I don't agree with getting rid of the Google Now Launcher but at least they're making it so other launchers can use some of its functionality, no matter how long it'll take for them implement it. Joseph I get that. I own a pixel, as well as several other Android devices. I'm just wondering why they don't release the Pixel Launcher for everyone to use. We already know that non-pixel phones will soon have Google Assistant. This seems to be the logical next step. Indefinite Implosion I mean, with Google Reader, they didn't have a replacement product, but now they do, but giving people Pixel launcher would stop them buying Pixel phones (doubtful; anyone who cares that much would already have a Pixel, or sideload it on their other phone) EowynCarter What the ? What about us nexus users ? Suicide_Note Buy a Pixel. EowynCarter Not availible in France. Bah, As long as don't need in wipe my nexus. I like my google now side panel. Tomáš Petrík There's still APKMirror. Omar Feliciano Buy me one. Suicide_Note Sure, but you'll have to do me a 'favor'. Brian Quit telling people to buy a completely new phone. Suicide_Note You seem upset. Perhaps you should buy a new phone to cheer yourself up? Matt That's almost 4 months old at this point. It probably isn't safe for very long. Suicide_Note It's safe until the Pixel Deux is released. Brian Menius Old news, last year's phone. The S8 will be here soon. Did I do it right? Davin Peterson Check your Nexus to see if you have a Nexus launcher installed. I found it on my 2013 Nexus 7 Christopher Estep Ever heard of PureNexus? It includes the Pixel Launcher, and I don't know of a Nexus device that does NOT have a build of some sort available (that includes the 5x and 6p) - in fact, I run an unofficial build on my GNex. teh Jax Whoa, somebody still uses the GNex? Impressive! demarcmj Just keep using it. Problem solved. William R. Washington You'll be fine. Changes and additions to the launcher are done via the Google App, which will continue to be updated. This is just saying a new install can't be done from the Play Store, which won't affect you anyway since the app can't be uninstalled. Merkin McGee I have a Nexus 5 right here with the Pixel Launcher, Google Assistant etc. If there is a will there is a way. Though I use Nova as my launcher on all my devices.. George What the shit Google? Kyle Sutter Man, they are jumping ship HARD on us Nexus people... Suicide_Note Buy a Pixel or use Nova. ;) Andrew Palmer So a one year old phone needs replacing? Stop talking shit. skillfulshoe No, a one year phone does not need a replacement. The launcher isn't just going to disappear on you, you can still use it. But if it upsets you that you don't have the latest Google experience launcher, buy the latest Google experience phone. OR Use a third-party launcher that will soon get some of the features from the GNL. Nova is a great choice. tom there is honestly no point in trying to talk to certain users about the pixel n_a_v You can't get Google Feed on Nova thecoolkid Let's hope we soon will, since they released the sdk... lzdking I used to make a full screen Google Now widget on one homescreen page. Doesn't look nearly as nice and missing some features but will be my solution if I can't keep using the Google Now Launcher. tekfr33kn Can you be more specific? Before I got a Pixel, I had a N6 and used a gesture setting in Nova (double-tap) to point to the Google app (not GNL). This took me to what I think you are referring to as the Google Feed. I found this to be easier for me than the standard swipe-right in GNL. n_a_v I meant that you can't set it as it's own screen. Yes you can open the Google app with a gesture or shortcut on a widget but you can't have a full page (not a widget) that's the feed. tekfr33kn Hmm, mine was a full page using me to my feed. It wasn't opening a widget. Strange. Light Nova is great because you always have the latest Android look. Now the Android N look has been associated with the pixel launcher. Back in the day I had material design before the Lollipop update hit my phone thanks to Nova. It's easily the least intruding thing you can do to give your phone's interface a facelift. MJ A phone needs to be replaced because development on the launcher ended? ziplock9000 I've been a huge Google and Nexus fanboi for years now. But how they have treated Nexus 6P users, seemingly abandoning them ASAP has changed my view. The support my Nexus 4 got lasted for much, MUCH longer with new features and updates. 6P hasn't even got assistant. Suicide_Note People need to just chill out. The features will come when they're ready. The sense of entitlement on display by some of these people is pathetic. theProffer Speaking of entitlement, you've earned this one: fuck off. Suicide_Note Awww, did i touch a nerve, sugar bear? I guess the truth hit a little too close to home for you. theProffer The fact that you think you are the bearer of some "truth" is the exact reason why you're a dick and need to sod off. Preferably you'd never get on the Internet again, but that's just a reach goal. Suicide_Note You're the one using foul language and such, but I'm the dick and need to stay off the internet? Oh, the irony. Perhaps you're the one who should stay off the internet, you limp wristed cuck. It's quite obvious you just can't handle it. Maybe stick to something more in line with your mental capabilities, like shuffleboard or dumpster diving. theProffer Pfft, "cuck"... Gtfo, chav wannabe, stop wasting our time. Suicide_Note Awww, are you feeling triggered, my precious little snowflake? Is the internet too tough for you to handle without mommy or daddy there to hold your hand? theProffer lol You sound like a 50 year old who finally discovered internet lingo and intends on using it at every opportunity. Pathetic. Almost as pathetic as you upvoting your own replies to me. Suicide_Note I upvote all good comments, and since all my posts are quite good, well. ;) ziplock9000 "The features will come when they're ready" is a hollow sentence that means nothing. When you purchase a product, you do indeed have an entitlement. With smartphones you expect a certain duration where the latest software is available, and it hasn't been on the 6P. This is a something Google themselves instituted as an 18 month cycle. Suicide_Note It's not hollow. Once Google has completed development on the software for a phone, they'll push it out. Also, they guaranteed OS updates, which they're following through on. They never promised that all previous Nexus devices would get all the Pixel features. ziplock9000 At the time of making that guarantee all features were part of the OS. By making these features separate since then, they have fucked us over by the back door. Suicide_Note Pixel launcher and Assistant weren't part of the OS. ziplock9000 Re-read my last post. Suicide_Note No, I'm not. Neither of the two things you mentioned were ever part of the OS. Of course, it would be too hard for you to admit you were incorrect. MJ Yes, it sucks the Nexus 6P didn't get Nougat or the latest security patches and Google is pushing out the kill-switch for them next week. ziplock9000 Nougat includes Assistant, their flagship project does it? MJ Weird I didn't say that... You know damn well Google Assistant is coming to Nexus phones and other phones. A feature that is temporarily an exclusive on a new phone doesn't equal the Nexus 6P is abandoned. ziplock9000 I assume it will at some point, but that's not my gripe. When assistant was released, the 6P had only just moved from being the flagship phone by a very short amount of time. They have thus far made us wait for months, and still we have no clear timing for when it will be available for the 6P. Yes it's a marketing move to sell more Pixel phones, but it's a MAJOR change in how Google treats it's existing loyal customers. In the past, and for years, they treated Nexus customers with all of the new things when they were released. The only delays were technical in nature.. Now they are fucking us over. MJ Damn, that is horrible. If it makes you feel any better I have it turned off on my Pixel XL... tekfr33kn The 6P got a hell of a lot more support than the N6. The N6 was abandoned within a few months after is started shipping. It was definitely the red-headed step child of the Nexus family, right next to the GNex. George remindMe in 7 years, when they jump the Pixel ship hard. Tomáš Petrík Yeah, this is not reddit. catalysto It's a joke. Tomáš Petrík I know, my comment was done in a humorous-sarcastic way too. Arkitech RemindMe! .... https://i.imgur.com/Ph6Ei.gif Mix Hey, just reminding you that in 7 years Google might jump the Pixel ship hard. LarsFromMars more likely 7 months VAVAMk_2 That's OK we have Nova which is what my Nexus devices use anyways. Maybe we get Pixel launcher. SyCoREAPER Everytime I try a new launcher I end back with Nova. It just has all the right features without system strain. Teresajrippeon Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !mj247d: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Kyle Sutter A boy can dream. Nick Unfortunately Nova doesn't seem appealing to me and I suspect many others. I don't want to customize every little thing of a launcher, I just want it to work and work well. VAVAMk_2 OK then there are plenty of other options out there... thecoolkid You don't have to, but it's there if you ever need it. It works just fine out of the box. And it's free. elchuby Nova works and works well. You don't need to customize every little thing of Nova, you just have the option to do it. El_Big_CHRIS Has it not work well on your phones? I ask because i havent had problems. I make it look like the pixel launcher and get the gestures and other things I like about nova NoNotTellingYou Worth it, if just for the backup/restore capability. Adrianus AJ Nadeak That's why I always come back to Nova: It works and works well. I primarily use it to change it icons and grid sizes. meijin3 Nothing against you, but it's not okay. There are people who have yet to even finish paying off their Nexus devices. I'd say this is bullshit but we don't have all the information yet and it may just be that they plan to consolidate everyone over to the Pixel Launcher. VAVAMk_2 You would be upset if we got moved to Pixel Launcher? In addition, it isn't like the apk for GNow Launcher will magically disappear from your phone. leonffs The pixel launcher is hideous compared to the now launcher imo. tekfr33kn How is it not ok? The GNL is being removed from your device and will still get updates. So what's the issue? If you have a 5x, you'l have the Pixel launcher. The 6p will get it soon and the 6 can get an approximation by using Nova. If you have a Nexus that's older, you're already outside the 2 year update window and will have what you're gonna have unless you root and install something else. More simply put, there is nothing negative happening to your phone based on this new information, remaining payments or otherwise. wshwe Pixel Launcher doesn't show up in the Store on my 5X. Once again Google is discontinuing something many people like. tekfr33kn The Pixel Launcher is specific to the Pixel and Pixel XL. If you want it on your 5X, you have to side load it from someplace like APKMIRROR. It will never show up in the Play Store on a non-Pixel. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ p0k3y Google simply doesn't care about their customers when it comes to Android. It's plain as day. It's time to say goodbye... Jason E Perkins You're on a real tear bashing Android, aren't ya. p0k3y Yep - nothing will improve if everyone continues to be a fanboy. Just look at the facts/trends and you will see that I am not at all hard or alone in criticizing Google. Jason E Perkins Nothing's going to improve just because you went on a bunch of tech news sites telling everyone who'd listen that Google is horrible and you're happy you switched. Criticism is healthy, but you're working on a while other level now. Lars Jeppesen Yeah, Apple REALLY CARES.. (removes headphone jack, lets you pay overprice for replacement adapters).. Yeah right p0k3y We are talking about software here. In that regard, Apple does appear to care more. As to the points your raised, sure, but just you wait and see how many Android phones this year will lose headphone jacks too. Lars Jeppesen I think you're right... sadly Christopher Estep I actually have the Pixel Launcher (which is standard with PureNexus 7.1 and later), and it also has the customizable grid (like Nova) and I came to PL from the GN Launcher, so I can't say that I miss it. Si vis pacem, para bellum This. I have been using Nova Launcher Prime on all of the smartphones and tablets that I have had from any manufacturer in the last 5 years, it's actually the first app that I install and configure. Features (first and foremost), performance, looks, configurability... it has it all. To me it's not a launcher, as things stand today it's simply THE launcher. leonffs But it doesn't have google now integration. Lot's of people using the Google Now Launcher are using it specifically for that reason. Si vis pacem, para bellum By Google Now integration you mean having Google Now as your leftmost page? I never saw the utility of that, on the contrary. I actually like not having it and so being able to swipe from the rightmost page and get to the leftmost one and viceversa! (one of the countless things that you can enable or disable in Nova) Besides, isn't that page accessible by tapping on the icon in the top left, on the Pixels (i.e. on the latest Google launcher)? What's the difference between that and having the normal Google Now app icon on your home page (like I do)? Fiorta It's the main reason I don't use third party launchers Si vis pacem, para bellum So same questions to you.. Roy ITS NOT THE SAME. Si vis pacem, para bellum *HOW*?!? It was a GENUINE question! All of these comments and not one of you is replying to: " isn't that Google Now page accessible by tapping on the icon in the top left, on the Pixels (i.e. on the latest Google launcher)? What's the difference between that and having the normal Google Now app icon on your home page (like I do)?" sweenish Dismissing it per your tastes is not a valid counter. Si vis pacem, para bellum It is NOT a question of tastes: *AFAIK* the latest Google launcher, the one on the Pixels and that will likely replace for everyone the one being discontinued, works exactly as if you put a normal app icon on the home screen. As a matter of fact, one of the great apps that I use is Chronus and among the other things it has a widget which looks and works exactly like the Pixel "bar" with the weather and and Google Now launcher so I could totally replicate on Nova both the look and feel of the latest Google launcher, if I so wanted. sweenish You are incredibly misinformed, then. Yes, you can tap the pill. BUT YOU CAN STILL SCROLL TO THE PAGE. Just like GNL. I mean, look at the design of the pill. It's intended to be pulled out. So, no, Chronus does not mimic it exactly. Neither does Nova. AL3 is the only third party launcher that 100% mimics the behavior correctly, and you need to root to make it a system app. And it is a question of tastes, the whole first part of your post was exactly dismissing it per your tastes. The rest was you not being informed. Si vis pacem, para bellum I wasn't sure how it works on the Pixels so I *asked* and I have been asking throughout the thread but for some reasons people just kept on saying that it isn't the same without freaking explaining *HOW* until finally Chris Lambert read one of those post and told me how it actually works. So you are incredibly misinformed about this thread... Now that I know that you can still swipe to get to that page then no, Nova doesn't exactly replicate that BUT I tried to ask this further questions: on the latest launcher (the one on the Pixels) you have to swipe starting from that "button", right? Or you can swipe wherever on the whole page, like in the older launcher which is being discontinued? P.S. And no, since I assumed that on the Pixels it worked differently (which might still be, it depends on the answers to the above questions..) it was not about tastes because if it worked like I thought it did you could replicate it on any launcher and if the answer to those question is that you can only swipe starting from the "pill" then you CAN replicate that in Nova! I'll explain why and how if the answer is positive. sweenish It was about taste at the beginning of your post. Right here: "I never saw the utility of that, on the contrary. I actually like not having it" You said as much yourself. The fact that you continue to argue about it while remaining completely uninformed on the topic is ludicrous. You simply never should have started since you don't have the facts. Stephen B Morris You can swipe from anywhere on the left side on the Pixel to get the feed just like on the Nexus. Si vis pacem, para bellum OK, then for those interested: - if it was on the "pill" only, Nova has an optional swipe action on every app icon (and even folders), so it could have reproduced that - since it is on the whole page, Nova can approximate it with its gestures. Not a swipe from left to righ, of course, because it's used to turn pages, but for example an upwards single finger swipe (which makes sense since it's reminiscent of how Google Now used to be invoked on Nexuses, starting from the home button IIRC..) Bewear I don't really see Google Now as useful. I don't even have the Google app installed... Anyway, good thing we have choice. Si vis pacem, para bellum I see it as very useful and I use it a lot, I just wouldn't like to have it as my leftmost and only page to the left of the home page. I would find that a big negative not a positive (for the reasons that I listed). I 100% agree with you about having choices, that's one of the countless reasons for which I love Android. Bewear Yeah! I mean, if you don't like feature X, you disable it or just remove its APK. ZteMaxProIsBoss Who cares honestly psychomaniac189 what i do instead of this left page for google now is hold the home button, or have an icon on my homescreen. haha. Rodrigo Your fitst paragraph is just your opinion. "Why do you like icecream? I don't like it, I prefer popsicle". I use only one homescreen and my apps in folders and the most used outside folders. Concerning your second paragraph: We're not talking about Pixel Launcher, but GNL. Scenario 1: sliding left and seeing google now Scneario 2: clicking and icon ocupping a slot that could be used to another app. Do you really think the two scenarios are the same thing? The same actions? If yes, so we don't have anything more to discuss. Justin It's the fast search feature, by tapping the Google Search Bar without the slightest loading (or animation) and you can start search right away, you still can't do it on Nova. Don't get me wrong I'm hailing to Nova the great. Si vis pacem, para bellum I am not sure I understand what's different from the Google Search Bar on my non_nexus device with Nova. It works exactly the same, tap on the left and it starts the text search, the keyboard comes up and you can immediately start to search, tap on the right and it starts the voice search. As an added bonus, you can also resize the widget (another invaluable Nova feature that I use with several widget, including BTW the Google Search Bar). I have the Google Search Bar only on my home page but with Nova you can also have the Google Search Bar on a fixed position on all pages, like on the Nexuses. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ff525d92dc7e45120734c5db6d19f8331df98872b825fbedf0a2f8b47a3971e4.png leonffs I quite like the swiping left mechanic. I have everything organized on one page so the multiple pages is not an issue for me. Dehaha1 I see some people have already given their explanations, but I just thought I would try and offer a complete response from my own view. Firstly, yes, on both the GNL and Pixel Launcher, a swipe from the left anywhere on the main home screen will bring you to Google Now. The reason the integration, not just the gesture, is important to me, is because of the fluidity. There is no loading, there is no stuttering, there is simply no waiting, you just swipe into it and immediately you can find what you were looking for. As it is part of your home screen, it is automatically making sure it's already updated for you when you swipe over, rather than needing to wait for it to grab everything that is new once you enter it. This is why it's important to me. On my aging Nexus 5, stutters and loading are becoming bigger and bigger issues, with the Google Now Feed being one of the last things I use that is still just perfectly seamless. If I were to use Nova Launcher, there is no set up that could reproduce that little bit of smooth joy I get from using the GNL to reach Google Now 2kool4skool That "Google now integration" can be solved by simply putting Google now shortcut to homescreen. Roy NO 2kool4skool Yes, yes it is. How is swiping left to bring out Google now better in any way than tapping its icon? You get the same result, just different way of activation. Roy No it's not the same. 2kool4skool Yeah sure whatever. Call me again when you come up with a better argument than just "no". Roy I don't know what to tell you except that I always come back to GNL only for that. I love that in the left side always when I want it. Si vis pacem, para bellum It's insane... They just keep repeating that it's not the same but can't manage to F'ing explain *HOW* it isn't! I don't have access to a Pixel so I can't see it for myself, from what I know from videos it's exactly the same thing! (and with Nova you ALSO get the advantages that I talked about) Chris Lambert If you tap the button it opens the search bar, not Google Now. Don't know why others couldn't just say that. Si vis pacem, para bellum Jesus Christ.. thanks for the answer! I felt like talking to 5 year olds... Stephen B Morris You can swipe anywhere from the left side on the Pixel as well. Stephen B Morris For me it is about the aesthetics and the experience when it comes to swipe vs tap. I enjoy the swipe action more and I personally feel that it gives more built-in feel than tapping. My phone has a bit of a minimalist look on my home screen despite having a ton of apps. I have 6 apps on my home screen and the rest tucked away in the app drawer. I only have the two screens, that home page and Google Now. With the screen size set to the smallest setting on my Nexus 6, it's a great setup for me. Using the icon or the widget doesn't "flow" as well for me. So for me this news sucks! MaximumFish I'm in exactly the same boat. Single homescreen plus Google Now to the left. When Nova supports GN like that then I'll switch. Android User You can use swipe gestures(like swipe up) to get into Google now on nova and It won't disturb your homescreen either☺️ Stephen B Morris Hmm... Good to know. However Westsiide mentioned backing up the apk and a lightbulb went off. I'm good now. Problem solved. Lars Jeppesen Same here. Geoff Johnson Eh, double tapping anywhere to launch Google Now is actually easier for me than swiping left, as I can access it no matter where I am on my other homescreens Elzafir Habsjah FYI, Action Launcher 3 has that Google Now integration. I switched from Nova Prime to AL3 recently, mainly because of that and several other unique features. It's solid. randomdog I found GNL to be a battery hog in the past. That's why I went back to Nova. Has Google corrected that? Elzafir Habsjah I never noticed any spikes in battery usage. But then again, I'm using a Redmi Note 4 with 4000mAh battery, so battery life is never a problem for me. It easily lasts me 12 hours of usage (6-7h screen on time) with all features on (sync, auto cloud upload, GNL, etc.). kks I've never liked Nova for some reason. Even back in the day when ICS just came out, I preferred Apex. Then I've used Google launcher for a long time because google now was just a swipe away and now I'm using the stock Samsung one because the background moves. I know that's a lame reason, but I like it. psychomaniac189 been using nova forever. using the beta and its really nice. no problems. us nova users always get the same things that the stock launchers has and a lot more features. thats why i use nova. I've never used a stock launcher since day one. alfreduran Hi! Totally agree with you! Viva Nova Launcher! I'm using Nova Launcher on my Nexus 6 XT1103, with Pixel theme, so happy! ☺️👌🏼💯 Orlando aka Pixel XL I stayed onboard with my pixel XL, but this is very true. I had the Samsung Nexus, so I go way back.. oh well. OnePlus 3+ took over, $479 for 128 GB model demarcmj People need to relax. The damn app hasn't been updated since November 2, 2015 anyway and now all of the sudden people are up in arms because it's not being updated anymore. If you like the app, just keep using it. Adrian Meredith The app itself does nothing its functionality is entirely contained within the Google search app. It is merely a shortcut to set it as your homepage ziplock9000 No people are up in arms because it's being discontinued. Very different. Nick Absolutely, I'd be completely okay with this if they were making the Pixel Launcher widely available. Light I'd be OK with keeping it there. I know I won't be able to officially install the Now Launcher on my new phone unless I get a Nexus, and there is no guarantee as if the Now pane will keep working. For all I knew, Google might pull the trigger on the Now feed for non nexus users tomorrow, and that's no bueno. Not a good sign. If you keep using a product Google is killing, you know that won't end up right. I just like GNL, deal with it. If Nova had that pane I'd switch to it full time. I paid for it, I mean. Hell, I switched FROM Nova just for the pane, and then this happens. Paul Grant So what happens when you get your next phone, go to install GNL and you can't cos it's been removed from the play store? WestSiide Perhaps backup the apk? Stephen B Morris I didn't even think about that! Genius! Thanks! Going to APKMirror right now. Someone cue Peg+Cat! Light And that is a solution for now, Android Police readers. The average joe who just wanted the Google feed on the left doesn't know. MadMartigan "The damn app hasn't been updated since November 2, 2015 " You are aware the launcher is just a shell and its functionality is actually part of the Google app...right? UKTK8 Can they make it any clearer that the Nexus line was just a beta and they are pushing people to make the jump to Pixel/production? JD No the Nexus was the Alpha, the Pixel is the Beta/ Developer Preview. The Real Google Phone, The Google Phone is 2-3 years away. Frogskins NOW WITH STICKER SUPPORT! SomeOne64 Package name of "google now launcher" is: com.google.android.launcher Package name of "Pixel launcher" is: com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher Does this mean anything?!😂 Red5 Welp, the numbers for Nova is about to explode even further... Nicholas Castano Glad I switched from my 6P to a iPhone 7 Plus. Sruly J Because of a launcher? Nicholas Castano No because Google clearly gives 0 fucks about the Nexus line Mark Curtis lol, you upvote your own comments Suicide_Note I don't know if you heard, but, the Nexus line is dead. Nicholas Castano ...which is why I'm glad I switched George yup, when the going gets tough, you quit~ good luck in life bro~ Nicholas Castano https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/756350bdddd392d2f467a57254b4249b9d0e82d9e5f48f851e698785f8529be2.gif Duder12 Stop spreading your stupid hate. The nexus line is getting google assistant and probably getting the pixel launcher at the same time. Duder12 What budget phone line has apple had that they cared about? Oh wait they have never had a budget phone line. Not an equal comparison. George Nexus 6P was a budget phone...? wat!? Duder12 For its specs and construction hell yes it was. Nicholas Castano ...Nexus 6P was not a budget phone... and you know the iPhone SE exists anyways, right? hunter2 Also, before the SE there was the 5C which is still on the most up to date iOS version 3.5 years after it's release. Duder12 Seriously? Do we really need to compare the cost of manufacturing the 6p vs the iphone SE/iPhone C? Do you have any idea how much more expensive the panel is on the 6p compares the SE and C? VAVAMk_2 Rumors say we are getting Assistant in next major update and 7.1.2 gives us swipe gesture on FP reader. I bet Nexus devices get Pixel launcher. saf1927 So much "zero fucks" that they stated it's going to be updated through Google Search, as always. Google Now Launcher on a Nexus is not even an app, just a shortcut to enable the launcher inside Google Search. Duder12 The Nexus line thats getting pretty much every feature as the pixel line for 2/3rds the cost. You just wanted an iPhone dude. Stop blaming your decision on Google. elchuby Well, I'm sure the news you'll find in Android Police won't matter to you as much anymore. Andrew Palmer So what about my Nexus 6P, the wifes Nexus 5X and my dad's Moto G? Matthew Rebmann It's a slight bummer but you can download Nova or any other launcher. They have almost all the same features except the slide to open Google Now. I've been on Nova Launcher since the Galaxy Nexus. Michael Tran The latest Google Beta has done away with the Voice Search shortcut. When I click the shortcut I had set up in the stable version it does nothing. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells AH! So it's not just me then. It was driving me nuts! el_smurfo By nothing, do you mean it generates a transparent overlay that does nothing? That's how it's now working for me. Michael Tran Yeah exactly that. Sruly J Even though I don't look at the Google Now panel as much as I used to, it's still useful for me for the parking location card. That and the fact that I don't want to have to set up my folders again are why I don't use the Pixel Launcher on my Nexus 5X. And yes, I know I could just root and install Pixel Launcher to the system image to get the Now panel. I just don't want to. pfmiller The parking location card was never reliable enough for me. Often it would only be accurate to within a block or two. I installed the app Valet a few months ago, and never looked back. It can be set to remember the location when you disconnect from your cars bluetooth, so no imprecise guessing about when exactly you left your car. Sruly J It gets me close enough to my car. Unfortunately though, my car doesn't have built in Bluetooth, so I use an adapter. It turns off after a little while if phone is out of range. pfmiller I use an adapter too. Yours doesn't turn off immediately when you turn off the car? I guess it depends on how your car's outlets are wired. Nicholas Matranga I hope Nova implements the now panel as soon as possible VAVAMk_2 Just set it to launch with a gesture. Nicholas Matranga I know I could do that, but it is not very smooth looking Adam Margeson That, and you can't swipe left to get back to the home screen. George They must have migrated the GNL team to the Allo sticker team, cause you know, they need more people pumping out stickers... hunter2 Allo is just one or two sticker packs away from breaking through. I can feel it, once they reach that magic number of sticker packs, they'll dominate the messaging world. freshprince_87 It will not if it doesn't have SMS integration Total Insecurity I am not shaming myself for using the Allo! Stu If Nova can add Google Now as a feature without being a system app then that'd be great. Davin Peterson I have a 2013 Nexus 7 and noticed a new Nexus launcher has been installed on it. The Nexus Launcher looks like the Pixel Launcher and is not in The Google Play Store. So, I switched to this launcher noodlynooman Where do you see it installed? Sashank Narayan Screenshots please? Davin Peterson https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0a72dd581e54d2a69c75a5810a5404b45a8429fa013f6db334a3941108950759.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c29d99615bd146d3858e515eed9127781b64fd8eb75e7e8d825cf0b43f0a446.png Sashank Narayan Thanks. This launcher was installed automatically with no notification? Renaldi I. That's an early, early version of Pixel Launcher, so early that it was only called Nexus launcher before the total rebrand. This launcher was only leaked though the internet. Are you sure you didn't forget about installing it? Davin Peterson I might have forgot about installing it. However, it is not in the Play Store and the Pixel Launcher is not compatible with the Nexus 7 Marc So in other words, if you want the new google now features you have to have the latest and greatest operating system... in other words, they're trying to make the current non android 7 devices feel old and obsolete as fast as possible in order to get rid of of android 6? JD Or you can go iOS. ProductFRED Can Google stop renaming/changing things needlessly for 5 minutes? George so Agile... Joe Kovacs It's the Google way... Gmail set the bar with 5 years in beta! n_a_v Navigation may have been even longer Adam Margeson Isn't Navigation still in Beta? /s Christopher Bement Gmail also worked like a release client when it was in beta. You really can't compare it to a lot of modern day permabetas. Diskus1 Byt Gmail is still Gmail... Imagine the Google Mail service transforming through 4-5 messaging platforms... JD Everything is always in Beta with Google. Nothing is a final product. Jasdeep Singh I have now lost track of what is being discontinued and what is being (re)started. /smh mcdonsco DAFUQ? Why? It's the best [simple] launcher out there? Damn it! Christopher Estep At least one community firmware (PureNexus) DOES use the Pixel Launcher (I run it on my GNex), and it's available for most Nexus devices (and I've seen at least three ways it's available for devices that are neither Pixel OR Nexus-based); further, if Google Now Launcher gets fired, I expect Pixel Launcher to become available for other devices officially via the Play Store. Brian Jones Link? Margaritas Ante Porcos Who needs Now or any other launcher when there's a Nova launcher? kalehv I love Nova but I also loved launching GNow by swiping to left kalehv Question, is this library only available to OEMs? If so, we can't expect it in Nova? Phlegon That's odd. I suppose Pixel launcher will take over for the Nexus devices if GNL removed Marcus This is stupid. Come on Google! Cory Wilson Lol actually though nexus devices might be getting pixel launcher officially when I read the headline. Guess not, bummer Arch9 Inb4 "Pixel Launcher available to download for everyone [APK Download]" destinyhud can i update from store after apk download? JSo Just hope they plan on at least replacing it with the Pixel Launcher. Amarus Kh I'm glad that I've migrated to Action Launcher a while ago. It has my favourite feature from the Google Now launcher and a ton of other nifty ones. Marc Zeldes It says right in the email, they will continue to support existing users of GNL by updating the Google Search App. So if you have it by default on your device, like my N6, then it will continue to function. No replacement ... Jordan L hmmmm... this is just part of the death of Non Pixel Google devices (aka Nexus). There will be no Pixel Launcher for "old" Nexus devices. This is just part of the retiring of the Nexus line. right??? Duder12 No this means you will probably get the pixel launcher when you get google assistant on your nexus Serge Cebrian i hope nexus 6 gets it :P Phoenix Google actually is started to scare me. Zach Mauch So how well does the pixel launcher work on the 6P? Timbets SearcLauncher.apk PLEASE! Mayoo Well I certainly hope that Pixel Launcher will open because the Now Launcher is the DEFAULT on the N5 ... (And my only one) David Hyman Makes no difference to me because I use action launcher 3 destinyhud google now launcher is just an enabler for launcher in google apps. removing it pretty much wont affect the functionality. look at the launcher's file size its just 12kb. JruASAP So Google can have 1000 messaging apps on the play store, but can't keep 2 launchers for those of us that like the GNL? i_say_uuhhh I guess Nova is probably a better option for you at this point. tranceformer978 I thought they trimmed it down to 900 messaging apps. pfmiller They discontinued 257 of them last week, but then they released 362 new ones to take their place. I know, hard to keep up. chromaniac Evie for the win. sebastianer Google keeps discontinuing Nexus, having the Pixel officially released in only 5 countries!!!! Pixel is already 3 months old. If Google keeps delaying a worldwide Pixel (2016) launch, they will release it close to the next Pixel (2017). So, please, stop saying, "Just buy a Pixel" and start saying "Just buy a Pixel if you live in the 5 countries where you can officially buy it". ;) Source: https://support.google.com/store/answer/2462844?hl=en Duder12 The Nexus phones are getting the Google Assistant which probably means they will get the Pixel launcher at the same time. So, please, stop saying, "Google keeps discontinuing Nexus" IcratoX I wouldn't hold my breath. Wait until the version with GA is launched. It's a big big speculation at this very moment. Also, read the line in the picture of the email at Q1 2017... Devilking190 This includes the Pixel C, right? Leonardo Baez So that menas that nexus user will get pixel launcher? matteventu Then what will they put on Android One devices? Miku is Best Vocaloid They should just free the Pixel launcher from their grip. Joe Kovacs There are two things to keep in mind with every Google product before buying/using... 1) you should consider it beta (features and functionality can come and go without notice), and 2) you should expect it to be temporary (it could be abandoned or replaced at any time). You just can't count on Google beyond now. Last year it was Nexus and OnHub, now it's Pixel and Google WiFi. If you're not comfortable with the expectation it could be abandoned at any time then you should probably look elsewhere. I'm not making a judgement, it's just the way I see it. JD Don't forget that it'll never leave beta, you're paying for the privilege of beta testing and they'll owe you nothing not even a working version of what you originally signed on for. This is why I will never buy another Google backed piece of hardware/product again. noodlynooman Totally agree. I'm a HUGE fandroid, but I recognize that I'm a beta tester for basically all of their products. Google's focus is advertising; everything else either needs to forward that or is a side project. Apple's focus is making devices and the software for the devices, so some people might be better off going with that brand. I am, however, interested to see what happens to the Pixel line. It seems to be Google's real attempt at a consumer device (as well as Home and WiFi), so it might be more consistent and have some longevity. Bryan Pizzuti I wonder if the means the Google panel could be added to Nova? Kieron Quinn If it's official, I would say so. I think it being a hack was the only thing stopping it from being added James Sarino Why is it so hard to give us Nexus owners the Pixel launcher? Are they just keeping that exclusivity so to force us to jump ship? As others mentioned, might as well use Nova. CD RW Pixel launcher is exclusive to only one device just like Google now launcher was exclusive to the nexus 5 during 6 months .. just wait pfmiller I personally don't want it. I'm hoping to avoid those ridiculous round icons for everything as long as possible. YuCMi Is it too late to reverse everything that happened when Alphabet became a thing? I want Larry Page to be Google's CEO again... Francesco Lorenzet basically now is pixel or GTFO NoNotTellingYou ITT: Tons of people whose phones won't be affected complaining about how they will be affected. Dirge Exactly. Haha JW Well, bad but I moved to Nova long time ago and never looked back. :P JD The Google Experience Launcher. The perfect name for it because this is the Google Experience. Just when you get used to it and it starts to work. FUCK YOU IT'S GONE OligarchyAmbulance So what happens to the Pixel C? You just have a deprecated launcher? Seeing as Google doesn't believe the Pixel C is a Pixel and doesn't give it Pixel features even though it's named "Pixel." -Matoro Zeliph- Google will release the Google Pixel launcher I bet steelew ...and assistant, I bet they're coming soon Martin Google is turning into complete trash... Hope iPhone 8 will be a great phone so I can go back to the right side! Google: We are adding this, but removing that.,, This is brand new: Changed only the name! Releasing new app: Basically copy of their own app with new name and missing features (Allo) Hey see we have a cool Assistant BUT it's only for Pixel phones.. We don't care that you are using our own OS... We care more about the money... So buy Pixel..! We have Launcher Google Now Launcher, But we have Pixel launcher too. Sorry, can't use Pixel one on other devices than Pixel.. Why? Because we don't want you to use it! So F*CK YOU Google. There is Apple! ;-) Hope soon someone will create a new OS that will be successful so the 2 muthaduckers see some big competition and put together thei sh*t! :) SavageJeep BUY A PHONE FOR WHAT IT IS, NEVER WHAT IT MIGHT BE!! Android is about choices and what suits you. Martin It's the same OS, should be treated the same way, especially from the people who build it :) SavageJeep Nope!! It's open source. Martin True. But under the hood all phones run Android. :) Doby Gillis Hope iPhone 8 will be a great phone so I can go back to the right side! The 10 year old has spoken! Martin The troll with has spoken. A lot bigger than 10. Which makes me a lot wiser than you. :) Taubin I think the word you are looking for is older, not bigger. And wisdom does not always come with age. steelew I got an iphone 7 for work and it SUCKS! It feels like they have made no changes since 2012. I had one that was jailbroken then and the only feature that is remotely interesting is force touch and even that is super gimmicky. I'm gonna guess you will be disappointed. Martin I switched couple months ago from iPhone 6 to Huawei P9. Really sorry for this decision. App on iOS are much better. The phone still was working like a beast. Could use it for another year. And sold it pretty much for the price of brand new Huawei P9. We all like different things. I prefer living with limitations on the OS, than slow updates, poor optimization, worse apps and etc. This is my own opinion of course. :) Richard Markert Lol, gg Google Erik Patrón well im kinda abandoning Google too, after being very happy with nexus after more than 2 years with my nexus 5, i was convinced i was going to be a recurring nexus customer, but now im jumping ship and buying a Xiaomi instead, not just because of this but Google seems to not give a f... lately, abandoning good projects left and right. David Gabel Indeed. My Pixel XL is not a bad device, but the OnePlus 3T seems to be just as good for much less money. I may switch to that soon. Erik Patrón Well if you already have a Pixel you have like the best in the market right now from what i've heard, specially de camera, a lot of reviewers claim that its the best camera in a phone, i dont know if a OnePlus 3t can compete with the pixel but i think you know more than i do about it. My problem is that i cant spend that much money in a phone and the Xiaomi brand is looking good for me because im always looking for the best features for the best price posible, thats why i buyed my nexus 5 at the time, but sadly it recently passed away. The new Google devices are way too expensive and the Nexus line seems to be discontinued, so i think im going to switch to xiaomi for now, i will miss the pure android experience tho. wjrandon I've gone back and rewatched the Google I/O 2016 keynote and it's simply amazing how hard Google has failed in 2016. K77bkny Why not release the Pixel Launcher to for all devices on the play store, wait that's asking for too much from Google, nothing Google does makes any sense anyways... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6dbf7eaf3daf08e5103d75891f1320dd24102ecc2ae426ef8353d18a65a0f482.gif Vivek Rameses They need some kind of selling point for their crappy pixel device. K77bkny You're probably right.. Wowdogeson Nice move, this would make me switch to Nova and stop using google now too. Agbontan Precious Hush this very bad. Prexblog.com might have an alternative. I prefer tecno mobile launcher. Midnitte "The email (which you can see below) explains that the Search Launcher Services library for OEMs that has been in testing is now available. That's what Sony used to integrate the Google Now panel (now just the Google Feed) into its stock launcher a while back. That means OEMs can slap the Google Now panel on whatever launcher they want. " Hm... Does this mean no third party launcher support? :/ mattcoz Doesn't sound like it, which would be unfortunate. There's probably some licensing issues in play. freshprince_87 Nova launcher is about to get a massive increase in income Tv I wonder if the "Search Launcher Services library" mentioned in the article will allow Nova to incorporate the Google Now scrolled page. Abhishek Kumar It does mention it's only for OEMs though. mwjii google hasn't learned with the allo disaster,keep gnl going mattcoz Reading through the comments, nobody seems to understand what's happening here. Nothing will be changing if you already have GNL installed. Updates have always been and will continue to be delivered through the Google App. New users just won't be able to download it from the Play Store, although they could always sideload it. I guess it's too much to ask to read through to the end of the article though. REkzkaRZ My launcher is getting launched?!?!? sweenish I feel like Google is only telling half the story, since that's all that the OEMs need to hear. I would like to believe that the Pixel launcher will be opened up to other devices. While the APK may not magically disappear from my phone, the removal from the store is still a bit dis-heartening. I do have Nova Prime, but I enjoy having a page for the Google Feed, and I much prefer GNL's folder scroll, something that Nova hasn't implemented. Nova also ALWAYS moves my wallpapers when I set them. It has done this ever since the material update. I may finally bite on AL3 after this. Davin Peterson Here is the Nexus launcher on my 2013 Nexus 7, which is not on the Google Play Store. I found it installed last month https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c29d99615bd146d3858e515eed9127781b64fd8eb75e7e8d825cf0b43f0a446.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0a72dd581e54d2a69c75a5810a5404b45a8429fa013f6db334a3941108950759.png Nomaan That's interesting, can you share the apk? Dmitry Stepanushkin post apk or liar :) Anonymous That's an early version of Pixel Launcher. Andy Please, please let this and the news of Assistant coming to Nexus devices mean they're just going to finally bring Nexus devices into the fold after the Pixel's exclusivity, and give us Pixel Launcher. I use Nova right now and it provides most Pixel features/aesthetics, but I just want the official right from Google. Shawn Hamm I wonder if this opens up the Google Now pane to third party launchers. Google Now is the ONLY reason I am not using Nova. I'd love Nova's features and customizability with a Google Now page integrated. Michał Grabowski Please! Discontinue: Gmail Google.com Allo Duo And all other servises, People are bored with the names of the servises! WE WANT ALL NEEEW STUFFF GOOOGLE!!! AND YES YOU CAN EVEN CHANGE NAME FROM GOOGLE TO "NEW" Jonathan Ive Sundar Pichai is taking the company down the drain icyhotmike this is google scare tactics: buy a pixel and everything will be alright - not Simon King I do like GNL, especially the Google Now integration! But I can still get that easily on Nova or Action launcher. I just go to the gestures page and set the swipe up action to open Google Now. You still have press back to get rid of it, but this is my preferred way of using Google Now. TomCos Will they release the Pixel launcher to everyone then? Steffen Laursen ;-( Pedro Nóbrega da Costa After so many years with OEMs doing shitty launchers, many of them finally converged to use the same launcher, that gave the real Android experience to everyone .. and is when they decide to end it? I feel Google Google actually likes the shitty Android fragmentation . Hard Little Machine It's a crappy launcher that no one likes StopBeingOffendedDERP Damnit google...I put the launcher on ALL my phones. DON'T! Lance Mace I really hope the open the Pixel Launcher to the latest Nexus phone, at least 5X and 6P... Please! SomeOne64 Fun fact Package name of "google now launcher" is: com.google.android.launcher Package name of "Pixel launcher" is: com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher Does this mean anything?!😂 Guest1986 Pixel C owner that is starting to get very confused why I bought this tablet!!! No Pixel Features like Nexus devices, and now to some degree no Launcher Soon! Seriously Google!! jimv1983 Right now I think anyone can get the stock Google launcher. For example, a Galaxy S7 can run the Google Now launcher. It seems that after this change that won't be possible. That really sucks. I feel even more sorry for anyone that doesn't have a Nexus/Pixel. Or maybe the Pixel launcher will be available in the Play Store? Lars Jeppesen 50+ million installs for GNL... dafuq? Also, what's the link for the Pixel Launcher? I can't seem to find it by a Playstore search (I'm in Brazil) Steve Chandler So, are you saying that the Joy Launcher someone has been running on my phone, and I found in the Google store, isn't a Google Launcher? I know my devices have been hacked. They probably have me looking in the wrong places. They run chimera on my phone and something I don't remember that was in Go language. It says I started Joy Launcher three times one night. Since then, I have just given up. Can't beat em. Jacob Persico F%$$^ IDIOTS why the #^%# would Google remove the "app drawer" from Android, whoever did that should be FIRED! That person obviously has no brain. This would be like Windows removing the start menu (and we know they had the start screen in Windows 8 as a replacement, but this would be like Windows NOT replacing it with ANYTHING). Android 6.0.1 is garbage. Jacob Persico So apparently this is LG's fault. So there new phones are crap that should be avoided. My strong advice, DON'T buy #LG. Jacob Persico As a mater of fact lets all #boycott #LG all together for this dick move. Until they fix what they screwed up by bringing back "app draw" and giving it to ALL users that have an LG smartphone missing the feature. Until then I will NEVER buy LG products EVER. Screw you LG.

The company's ad business is "gaining significant momentum" and will take market share from Google, Facebook, and others, BMO's Daniel Salmon said in a note out Tuesday morning. Salmon upped his price target on Amazon to $1,200 from $900. Amazon closed Monday at $891.51. The advertising segment of e-commerce giant Amazon's business model has the potential to grow sales by 65 percent in 2017, reaching $3.5 billion, Salmon added. "A key point of differentiation for Amazon [from competitors] is the massive amount of consumer purchase data it possesses." "While Google knows what people are searching for and Facebook knows what people are interested in and who they are connected to, Amazon knows the specific products that customers are purchasing and how frequently they are purchasing these products." BMO also downgraded Google's parent company — Alphabet — to market perform from outperform on Monday. Those shares dropped more than one percent in premarket trade. Amazon was little changed in premarket trade on Tuesday's news, after hitting an all-time intraday high of $893.49 on Monday. BMO Capital maintains an outperform rating on the stock.

By Josh Robbins April 4, 2017 14:41 BST Cadbury has been criticised over its Easter branding for two consecutive years.Reuters Is Cadbury making a strategic attempt to gradually replace the crucifix with a chocolate rabbit? For the second consecutive year, the confectionary giant has found itself in the cross hairs of the British press for taking the "Easter" out of Easter. In 2016 it was the eggs; this year it's the egg hunt; next year... who knows, is Archbishop Justin Welby willing to put on a Dairy Milk hat? But while Cadbury seem happy to assume the mantle of 'Easter villains" for now, it's worth remembering that there were controversies long before their PR team had that meeting. The last five years alone have each produced a fresh affront to the religious weekend. At IBTimes UK, we've decided to look back at them. Happy Easter everybody! 2013: Easter Sunday Google doodle celebrates Cesar Chavez California labour leader Cesar Chavez was admired by President ObamaWikipedia The folk at Google stepped on a few toes in 2013 when their Easter Sunday homepage featured a portrait of civil rights activist Cesar Chavez, marking what would have been his 86th birthday. Chavez was a nonviolent labour and equalities campaigner born on 31 March 1927. He died in 1993 and remains an icon for Latin Americans. It is important not to confuse Cesar Chavez with controversial former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez — as a few right-wing bloggers did during the ill-fated Easter weekend of 2013. Gerald Krueger summed up the mood when he wrote on Twitter: "On resurrection Sunday Google scum bags honored Hugo Chavez a murderer and Dictator human waste... Great job Google Hell is hot DYK [do you know]." To add salt to the wound, President Barack Obama had the year before declared 31 March to be 'Cesar Chavez Day' in recognition of the union man's contribution to American life. His very ennobling only added to the consternation of Americans who felt that Easter was under attack. 2014: David Cameron says "Jesus invented the Big Society" Picture the scene: you're David Cameron and it's almost March 2014. You've got just over a year until the next general election, which nobody thinks your party has a chance of winning outright. Best make plans for another power-share with the Lib Dems, or even Ukip. As an afterthought, lob something about an EU referendum into the manifesto. See if that won't persuade a few of the doubters. Nothing will come of it anyway... Meanwhile, you need to write this bloomin' Easter speech. Your spin guy Andy Coulson's a bit busy answering questions about phone-hacking at the moment so... right... need a line. What about: "Jesus invented the Big Society 2,000 years ago. I just want to see more of it." That's actually what Cameron went with. While he was never famous for being short on self-belief, the claim that his government's social policy was a direct continuation of Christ's work had many observers pausing for a moment. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said "Jesus invented the Big Society"Toby Melville/Reuters 2015: Obama asks Christians to think about the way they treat others In Obama's address to the 2015 White House Easter Prayer Breakfast he paid homage to God, Christ, various churches, the laity and America. Then he said: "On Easter, I do reflect on the fact that as a Christian, I am supposed to love. And I have to say that sometimes when I listen to less than loving expressions by Christians, I get concerned. But that's a topic for another day." Big mistake. Obama was jumped on by sections of the media for finally admitting what they had long suspected: he doesn't like Christians. Indeed, he probably isn't one. Fox's Bill O'Reilly said: "In the political arena, it seems like President Obama is more skeptical of Christians than he is of Muslims," before adding the immortal qualifier: "That may not be true but that's what it feels like." Former US President Barack Obama was mistrusted by the conservative rightReuters 2016: Cadbury drops "Easter" from its Easter Egg boxes Cadbury (and, to be fair, a number of other chocolate egg manufacturers) were accused of removing the word "Easter" from the front of a number of their Easter Egg packages. Tabloid newspaper editors were overjoyed to discover the next iteration of the "they've banned Christmas" story and the game was afoot. Cadbury have come under fire for the second consecutive EasterReuters 2017: Cadbury/ National Trust chocolate Egg hunt riles Theresa May Not content with slowly killing Easter on their own prerogative, Cadbury teamed up with the National Trust to upset more people this year. Their decision to remove "Easter" from the name of a jointly organised annual egg hunt has provided a nice little development on last year's egg fiasco. Even Theresa May, self-professed prime minister and vicar's daughter, took time out of her trip to Saudi Arabia to label the decision "absolutely ridiculous". In an ironic twist to the scandal, May drew our attention to the issue just before jetting off to Saudi Arabia, a country where celebrating Easter – in public at least – is banned.

However, if you are privacy-conscious enough, you can listen to all of it and delete what you want. In June 2016, Google launched a new portal for all user account-related activities, from where you can manage your privacy settings and see what you have searched for. Here is how to find and delete the recordings of your voice searches. Log into history.google.com Go to “Activity Control” on the left side of the screen Go to “Voice & Audio Activity” Scroll through the list to see everything you have searched for using your voice Check the boxes next to the recordings you want to delete (you can only check one box at a time)  Click on "Delete" to complete the process Voice searches are far from the only thing Google saves about its users. All of your search history is saved as well, and if you want to delete that as well, here is how. Go to Google's history page Click on menu (the three vertical dots) and then hit "Activity Controls" Go to "Web & App Activity" and click on "Delete" to complete the process Similarly, you can go and delete your location history, device information and YouTube search history. If you want to stop Google tracking your searches for good, head to the activity controls page and toggle tracking off. However, turning off tracking doesn’t mean Google will stop recording what you say to it or storing what you search for. It only means the data will be saved anonymously instead of being linked to your account. Google claims it stores users’ searches to make ads more relevant and to improve the search feature. If this storage of your internet data makes you feel like your privacy is violated, the only option you have is to not use Google’s services. But if you think it’s illegal for Google to store your data, you would be wrong. When using its services, you agree to allow Google saving your data. Read Google’s Privacy Policy here to understand how and under what circumstances Google can share your information. Related: For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android.

Turing Award, computing’s version of the Nobel Prize. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, is this year's recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing's version of the Nobel Prize. The honour comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune thanks to Berners-Lee's efforts to make the internet more accessible and useful.  (Charles Krupa / AP)   By Michael LiedtkeThe Associated Press Tues., April 4, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO—Most people who search on Google, share on Facebook and shop on Amazon have never heard of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But they might not be doing any of those things had he not invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee, 61, is this year’s recipient of the A.M. Turing Award, computing’s version of the Nobel Prize. The award, announced Tuesday by the Association for Computing Machinery, marks another pinnacle for the British native, who has already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th Century by Time magazine. “It’s a crowning achievement,” Berners-Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But I think the award is for the Web as a project, and the massive international collaborative spirit of all that have joined me to help.” The honour comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, one of many companies that made a fortune as a result of Berners-Lee’s efforts to make the internet more accessible. He managed that largely by figuring out a simple way to post documents, pictures and video — everything, really, beyond plain text — online. Article Continued Below Spinning the web Starting in 1989, Berners-Lee began working on ways digital object could be identified and retrieved through browser software capable of rendering graphics and other images. In August 1991, he launched the world’s first website, http://info.cern.ch . Besides coming up with the web’s technical specifications, Berners-Lee “offered a coherent vision of how each of these elements would work together as part of an integrated whole,” said Vicki Hanson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In an even more significant move, Berners-Lee decided against patenting his technology and instead offered it as royalty-free software. That allowed other programmers to build upon the foundation he’d laid, spawning more than a billion websites today that have helped lure more than 3 billion people online. Caught in the web The web’s widespread appeal gratifies Berners-Lee, who now splits his time shuttling between the U.S. and Britain as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford. But he fears parts of the web will become less accessible in the U.S. if the Federal Communication Commission dismantles regulations protecting “net neutrality.” That’s the principle that internet service providers should treat all websites equally instead of favouring some destinations that might be willing to pay for special treatment. If the Trump administration tries to dump net neutrality, “it’s going to have a fight on its hands because I think the American people realize it’s important,” Berners-Lee said. “It allowed America to benefit from a thriving internet market for connectivity and content. It has become part of the spirit of America.” Berners-Lee also worries about governments around the world using the internet as a surveillance tool, calling it a “recurrent threat.” He admits that preserving personal privacy as technology advances remains a thorny problem, one that he doesn’t have a ready solution for. But figuring that out is “really important to the future of society,” he says. “As an individual, I should be able to keep my own notes, keep my own journal and not share it with anybody. That is just part of being a person.” Beyond the web Like several other prominent figures in technology, Berners-Lee isn’t sure if humanity will be better or worse off as computers grow better at thinking like people via artificial intelligence. “Computing has grown exponentially more powerful, so it’s only logical that it will get to the point when computers will become smarter than us,” Berners-Lee said. “So, yes, we should logically think about those consequences.” This is the 50th anniversary of the A.M. Turing award, named after English computer scientist Alan Turing, whose revolutionary work with early computers and artificial intelligence helped crack Nazi Germany’s codes during World War II. Previous award winners include Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who did some of the pioneering work on the internet that Berners-Lee spun into the World Wide Web.

Ibrahim Haj-Ibrahim remembers his first months in Victoria, the frustration of using his limited English to try to open a bank account or buy a cellphone plan. The Syrian refugee and father of four, who arrived in Victoria February 2016, would sometimes leave interactions with Canadians feeling confused, frustrated and helpless. “For all newcomers it’s challenging,” he said. It’s a situation familiar to many refugees and immigrants who are slowly learning English. In the last year, about 415 Arabic-speaking Syrian refugees arrived in Greater Victoria, 95 per cent of whom speak a low level of English. The Intercultural Association has partnered with Google Translate to help Greater Victoria’s refugees and immigrants overcome these often frustrating language barriers. The ICA wants to train as many people as possible in the Google Translate app, including businesses, community agencies, public services and schools. “What we’ve found is that language skills, they’re going to take time to develop. But in the interim, we’re looking for way to bridge that communication gap,” said Kate Longpre, ICA’s community integration co-ordinator. The free app works like a digital interpreter, allowing two people who speak a different language to communicate through a smartphone. One person says a sentence into the app and it’s translated into one of 103 languages. You can also take a photo of a word and the app will tell you what the word is in your language. Anyone who completes the training will receive a We Speak Translate decal, which serves as a visual symbol of inclusiveness. “This will be a symbol around Victoria that says: ‘We’re committed to diversity and value inclusiveness and we’re going to try and work past communication barriers while language skills are still developing,’ ” Longpre said. Longpre said she came up with the idea while trying to think of ways technology can help newcomers integrate into their new home. She said Google was heavily promoting the Translate app during the 2016 Rio Olympics, training taxi drivers and other tourism operators how to use it to communicate with visitors. Longpre reached out to staff at Google, who agreed to provide training and design and print the decals. “So when newcomers are out in the community, let’s say they show up at Crystal Pool and they see the decal, they feel comfortable this is a safe space and they can use Google Translate to communicate,” Longpre said. “It’s not always 100 per cent perfect [translation], but it’s that moment of being able to connect and work with someone you haven’t met before.” Staff from Google are coming to Victoria to launch the project and provide the training on April 12. Many immigrants and refugees are already familiar with the app, but ICA will provide training to all clients and staff. Ayhan Duman, owner of Seven Valley Fine Foods on Douglas Street, said his native tongue is Turkish and he has used Google Translate with some Arabic speakers who come into his shop. Longpre said newcomers are still encouraged to improve their English and continue language classes, but this could allow them an easier transition while they’re learning. “I don’t think Google Translate will help you tell your life story to someone, but it might help you navigate a situation where you need a bit of support in terms of integrating and accessing a service,” she said. Greater Victoria welcomes an average of 1,400 immigrants and refugees each year, according to the Victoria Foundation. The ICA provides settlement services to newcomers, including helping people find housing, apply for jobs and access social services. The ICA also offers English-language classes to about 450 people. The We Speak Translate project launch takes place on April 12 between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. at the Delta Ocean Pointe Hotel in the Arbutus A room.

Samsung initially planned to unveil its highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone during MWC but the company’s plans soon changed. Instead of launching Galaxy S8, the South Korean tech giant decided to unveil Galaxy Tab S3. This is Samsung’s tablet flagship and its one of the most technologically advanced gadgets ever made. We can be sure that once the tablet hits the market, Samsung is going receive a huge number of orders. What’s interesting is that Galaxy Tab S3 might actually have some big competition this year. Usually, Samsung’s tablet is regarded as being the best Android powered tablet but this year Google has something to say. The Android parent is expected to refresh its Nexus 7 tablet offering during late 2017. We have rounded up the most believable rumors surrounding Google’s upcoming tablet so that we can compare it against Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S3. Google Nexus 7 (2017) Hands down, this is the most anticipated tablet. There are many media outlets that are talking about it and the entire Android community is sparking rumors about it on a daily basis. This is why it wasn’t hard for us to gather vital information about it. Nonetheless, let’s take a look at what Nexus 7 (2017) is going to bring. The tablet will ship with a 7 inch AMOLED panel that’s expected to have a high resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. Regarding hardware power, the gadget will be fueled by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chipset that’s going to be fitted with 6GB of RAM. Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 The South Korean tech giant has equipped the tablet with a 9.7 inch Super AMOLED display that features a high resolution of 1536 x 2048 pixels. In addition, the display features multi-touch functionalities that supports up to five fingers. When it comes to hardware performance, Samsung’s tablet is powered by Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor. The chipset has been clocked at 2.15GHz and it is paired with an Adreno 530 graphics processing unit and 4GB of RAM. Final Thoughts If the rumors surrounding Nexus 7 (2017) prove to be true, it’s safe to say that Samsung is going to have some tough competition this year. Especially since Android fans will flock over to Google’s “pure” Android tablet instead of acquiring Samsung’s tablet which also runs on Android.

The group members include prominent Android smartphone manufacturers; Samsung, LG Electronics, Foxconn, HMD Global, HTC, Coolpad, BQ, Allview and, of course, Google are part of the group. Google is calling it ‘Pax’, which means peace in latin, in the hope of creating some peace around patents and licensing terms. The Pax website describes the group as “royalty-free community patent cross-license”, which will cover Android and Google Applications that are pre-installed on Android device. This is a “community license because all members grant licenses to one another on a royalty-free basis, thereby promoting patent peace within the Android ecosystem,” explains the website for Pax. According to Google’s blogpost with patent peace, there is space for innovation and healthy competition, which will benefit users. Google’s Android is already an open-source OS, with licenses being free for all manufacturers or anyone really. Google says it has over 400 partners manufacturers in the Android ecosystem with over 4,000 major devices being manufactured in 2016 alone. Also read: Google’s Android beats Windows to become world’s most popular operating system Google’s Android, which has over 1.6 million active users, has also surpassed Windows as the most used OS for the internet. Now Google believes PAX will expand the open-nature of Android, and ensure that time and money is not spent on patent wars. PAX is not the only initiative Google has taken to stop some of these patent fights. In the past it has participated in the LOT Network and the Open Patent Non-assertion Pledge. The latter was developed by Google to fight patent threats around open source software.

Here's How To Hedge Yourself Meet One Of The Largest VC-Backed Cannabis Companies In The U.S., Generating 300% ROI In 10 Weeks The Vetr community has downgraded $AMZN to 2.5-Stars (Vetr) It's always difficult to keep track of what teens consider cool these days, but a recent survey conducted by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google's market research wing provides some valuable insight. Google's report, titled "It's Lit: A guide to what teens think is cool," ranks brands by their coolness factor. The main takeaway is that some of the brands widely considered to be ultra-popular with teens are in fact not on teens' radars. For example, Vice, the new-age media empire that was presumed to be coveted by younger people because of its online presence and unique documentaries, is in fact dead last in both categories: least aware and least cool. Vice even ranked lower than the Wall Street Journal. "Everything you've ever thought was gnarly, sick, rad, tubular, cool, kool, kewl, or hipper than heck turns out to be a lie," Spin.com noted. Aware But Not Cool Here is a list of companies that ranked high in the awareness category (at least 7.5/10) but low on the coolness scale (below 6/9). The stock's one-year performance is also explored to see if there is any observable correlation. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF) -64.01 percent. J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP) -43.37 percent. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) -2.53 percent. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) +2.04 percent. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) +22.59 percent. Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA)/ EA Sports +35.18 percent. Sprint Corp (NYSE: S) +138.9 percent. Aware And Cool Here is a list of companies that ranked high in the awareness category (at least 7.5/10) and high on the coolness scale (at least 6/9). Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UAA) -76.8 percent. L Brands Inc (NYSE: LB)/ Victoria's Secret -48 percent. Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) -34.71 percent. GoPro Inc (NASDAQ: GPRO) -26.66 percent. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) -4.23 percent. Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) +14.26 percent. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) +30.65 percent. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) +48.96 percent. Top 3 Here are the three most popular brands: Alphabet Inc's Google +11.82 percent. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) +39 percent. Youtube. Bottom Line At first glance, it might be erroneous to conclude that a stock's performance is tied to its coolness factor among teens. For example, the best performing stock, Sprint, ranked low on the charts. On the other hand, L Brands' Victoria's Secret brand ranked high, but its stock has been cut nearly in half and hit a 52-week low of $45.76 Monday. Also, GoPro ranked 7.5/9 on the cool scale and 7.75/10 on the awareness scale but its stock has been under pressure for quite some time. Apple scored an almost perfect 10/10 on the awareness scale but its coolness score fell short of GoPro at 7.5.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 56 Plus 1 on G+ 152 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares294 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD Adrian Meredith Hmm what? Vr is incredible can't go back to playing elite on a 2d screen Jesse Lee You must be using Daydream VR and not Oculus because you would have realized you're comment is complete shit. George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.) MicroNix And you think that would be fair when it was Samsung that was to market much earlier with VR than Google? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Sorry to break it to you. But cardboard was out in June of 2014. Gear vr didn't get released until like november of 2015. Over a year later. And at that time, it was basically just a plastic google cardboard. Willie Chalmers III Well, Cardboard was introduced at I/O in May 2014, and Gear VR was released in November 2015. Daydream was released in November 2016. Does that make it any more fair? It doesn't matter if it's fair, I'm just explaining Google's options. I'm not happy about the prospects, but I noted that Google could make Daydream a requirement for GMS at the risk of an antitrust lawsuit. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) they couldn't even if they wanted to the daydream requirements are hardware specific and most phones don't meet them. Willie Chalmers III The phones already support the hardware necessary for Daydream, and Google meant EXISTING phones wouldn't support Daydream when they announced it. Google said that most new Android phones could very easily support it. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Not that simple. For example The G6 can't support it. Not because it doesn't have a screen and a gyroscope like daydream's cardboard cousin but because the LCD panel isn't capable of the fast refresh times needed for VR on that scale. I know that many of you think the gear VR is just like cardboard but it's more like a poorman's oculus. Daydream is on the same playing field as the Gear VR sure but that doesn't mean existing phones or even new ones can join the party. is every phone going to abandon LCD? I don't see that happening just yet. Willie Chalmers III Okay, I didn't realize the G6 doesn't have the hardware requirements to support Daydream, but there is (mind you) likely no reason besides an ulterior motive for the S8/S8+ not to have Daydream support. Could there be hardware requirements that the S8/S8+ don't support? Absolutely, but Daydream can already be enabled and used with the phone by editing a config file as root.

Willie Chalmers III Yeah, I noted that. That's the unfortunate reality of corporate politics. JohnyNoLegs Maybe since Samsung comes up with everything great in Android, Google should be the one using Samsung rather than the other way. Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Kawshik Ahmed Google can't implement Gear VR to Android because it's not Open Source rather it is own by Oculus/Facebook. If a OEM share their technology with AOSP, Google have no problem to implement it, take for example Sony, who shared 50+ enhancement in Android O alone. X-47B or think Google - who don't add even the latest google search to AOSP. Is latest chrome, google assistant part of AOSP? Samsung shared KNOX with google, which they are not supposed to. Kawshik Ahmed Chrome has it's own Open Source form named Chromium so it doesn't need to be with AOSP. Anyone can use it like Opera and many others are doing. Google Search and Assistant are not features or enhancement nor part of the actual OS, they are services and it takes money to maintain the servers to run them. I don't think any company will make their services open sourced. It's like saying Samsung should open source Bixby which will never happen. blueman24 That would be good only if samsung made any polished software plus made it open source. JohnyNoLegs Google can't even do that so not sure what you are inferring. illregal Said no one ever. Samsung is a disease. Holding back true innovation with their lackluster devices. Diogo Neves Yeah, the competition really looks fierce for Samsung lol illregal buying reviews, paying to badmouth your competition, marketing dollars and dumbasses eating it up doesn't mean the device is any good. It means you've been had. JohnyNoLegs Sounds like Apple to me haha. Pixel isn't far behind... Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Chris Sanner that's...nice? but it means lock-in - if I'm on a nexus/pixel and I leave for a samsung phone...I lose what content I had. if I decide that's fine and move to samsung, if I want to leave and go back to a pixel I lose the content. that means I have to be willing to bet that I will *always* buy Samsung. and guess what - I'm not. Anthony820 And when I switch to Canon I lose all my Nikon lenses. And when I switch back I lose all my canon. And went I switched from iPhone I lost all my apps and had to re-purchase them for a new OS. I say everyone fully endorses their competition's ecosystem of services/products. Chris Sanner um...except this is like someone making a canon-based camera and refusing to support the new cannon attachments on the next release. that's kinda shitty and would be enough to keep me from buying the cannon-based camera OligarchyAmbulance "Miles ahead" lol ok Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. MJ I am not sure why Samsung VR is so funny and... No updates for you huh? Are you one of those people still using Windows XP on their PC? JohnyNoLegs Samsung be is available for customers of Samsung, and it's far better than Daydream still. And no I'm on pixel xl running 7.1.2, but really it's the same as 7.0 so no benefit of having pixel for the past 5 months. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. Ra1nb0wD4sh DE I would totally get a HTC Vive, but it's too expensive atm. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They want you to use GearVR MJ Yes, which is the opposite of giving customer choice aka what they may want. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Corporations don't care what you want Rob Cook Your argument is invalid, Samsung isn't forced to provide Daydream as they have developed, in their opinion a superior alternative. The customer choice here is to not buy Samsung if you feel that Daydream is the better product (arguably it's not). You logic is saying that Samsung MUST provide Daydream as well or there isn't a choice being offered at all. That's like saying that Cheverolet MUST offer a V12 quad-turbo in the Corvett because Bugatti offers one in the Chiron. Yes both are cars but that's it. MJ Ummmm The argument I never made is invalid? OK... Dude, I never said Samsung should be REQUIRED to provide Daydream support. I did infer Samsung should should give their customers options. LOL I do agree about NOT buying Samsung products. It is amazing to me all comments defending Samsung on this. Who doesn't like options and prefers a walled garden? Oh yeah... Your analogy was really stupid by the way. What I am saying is the what Ford does with their touch screen system in supporting Apples' CarPlay and Android Auto is better way to go than just supporting one or the other or using a proprietary only system. Jesse Lee Well then why didn't Google offer Oculus support on its Pixel phones....no customer support needs I guess. This was a no-brainer, I thought anyway but.... Dave I will not buy a S8 without Daydream. I was going to finally buy my first new phone since the Note 2, but now think I will wait for the Pixel 2. Mike549 They're losing my purchase of an s8 because of it. I already have the s7 with gear VR but I want access to Daydream too. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They chose not to support it because they are not idiots. Why would they risk losing VR market share? MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. illregal Samsung copied google here.. There's no debate, gear vr came out way after cardboard. samsung pay, etc.. All out after google. Samsung hasn't had an original thought in years, unless it has to do with ripping off their idiot customers. JohnyNoLegs I didn't know Cardboard had sensors in it..... I thought it was just a piece of cardboard with a lense... dhamp2g Cardboard was 1st dude!!! JohnyNoLegs Then VR with actual sensors and lag free use came out... DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. illregal oculus is proprietary crap and losing badly to vive. Kwetsima Maluleke Is it? Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Ryan IMHO Gear and daydream provide the very same experience in term of quality. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Mike549 Verizon stores have Daydream devices for demo purposes. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. Klark Kenneth Wait, are you saying it's a fail or are you saying "No? FAIL."? MJ "Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL." What the hell is that supposed to mean? Jesse Lee Dude, stop trolling. Nexus phones were made by Google, the N6 was less then 2 years old when Daydream VR came out and Google didn't even support it. Yet, you're comments seem to contradict that reality and keep bashing Sammy when Google's support is much much worse when it comes to VR. You're barking up the wrong tree is how the expression goes and its apparent from reading this section. MJ Speak about trolling... The OP statement I quoted made so sense so I asked him to explain it. What does that have to do with you buddy? Daydream is NOT supported on the Nexus 6? So what? You need minimal hardware support for a good experience so it's better than something like Cardboard. FACT: Samsung’s first consumer Gear VR headset didn't support any previous Samsung phones either. FACT: Goggle Daydream is open to other OEMs while Samsung's VR solution is NOT. Now go away... Mike549 Agreed. I think the same applies to the Rift and Vive for exclusive too. Ryan The most targeted platform is Cardboard... ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Sudev Together but not the same :) Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. Ryan I disagree it's a bit like the console/PC war non sense. While I understand people might want to only experience it on PC for obvious reasons there are a lot of smaller players that are enjoying mobile VR a lot. While it's true there is a lot of crap in the store there are some really good games. Jon Fridman VR on phones doesn't look anywhere near as good based on experience. Consoles are irrelevant to this as well because they still don't have the raw power a PC can (yes thst includes the PS VR headset). While the graphics may look decent, they can't compare to higher end systems. Once VR has matured I think it'll be fine to use on phones. In the current state I cannot see a reason to use a VR headset. I won't buy one for my PC either despite having a more than capable set up (i7 6800K/EVGA 1080FTW/32GB RAM). When the next generation comes out I'll likely buy one. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol op12 Daydream expanded beyond the Pixel a while ago... https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/#daydream-ready-phones Jesse Lee Yeah, it works great on any phone now named Pixel Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Atoqir Well that is saying like "Why do my PS4 exclusives don't work on Xbox" There is always some artificial lockout to make a platform more attractive. And I don't think it's a bad thing. It makes competitors do better and create the best platform for the biggest chunk of users. And the least popular loses and doesn't have a vibrant ecosystem. Look at Windows Mobile as prime example. Cause we are not talking about regular hardware products anymore. These days every products is a weapon the "wars of the ecosystems/platforms" Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Ryan VR is not pleasing for everyone.But there are a lot of people that love it. kalehv Oh I love it too. but there's not much to do yet. Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR. Ryan And this is why, as a VR Dev , I only target cardboard for now. Hope the VR future will be brighter and easier for everyone! It is a really good medium. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So you'd rather target a limited audience rather than a large one? How is this a good business decision? darkvadur 1 April??..... Sudev Together but not the same :) Mike549 I was going to get the S8 if it supported both platforms but not now. I'll just keep my S7 and get a Daydream compatible phone if an interesting one comes out soon. Sean Thomas to be fair...daydream is bad. I haven't used Gear VR, but Daydream isn't worth it right now if they already have a platform with more support. Daydream shouldn't be on par with oculus if it's bad tbh. Google should just work with oculus to make an android-wide deal. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Serious question: Does the Pixel / Pixel XL support Gear VR? Jordan L probably not, I'm guessing Gear VR is a Samsung exclusive thing. Whereas Daydream is available to all. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Isn't Gear VR the same VR as Oculus? If so, it's not Samsung exclusive. Jordan L I don't know. I thought it was called Samsung Gear VR. Oculus has a VR framework that is available to cell phone makers? If that's true, then Daydream should work work that, I agree. A big part of Daydream was the ability for other companies to join in. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I googled it. Yes, Samsung Gear VR is powered by Oculus. So it's probably going to have the most content, which is what will make it the most successful VR. If it turns out Daydream gets the most content, then I'm sure Samsung will support it. Otherwise they'll lose customers. This is no different than prior format wars like Betamax vs. VHS or HD DVD vs. Blu-ray. Whoever gets the most content wins. Jordan L Fragmentation. Google allows all companies to attempt to do Daydream... so Samsung does their own thing. Chris Sanner Dear Samsung: this sort of shit is why I refuse to buy any more of your phones. like, ever. dhamp2g WTF this type of shit kills me. Why wouldn't google make it required to use android?????. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Why does it bother you? If Daydream wins the VR competition, then Samsung will either lose customers or be forced to support Daydream. If Gear VR wins, then Google and Daydream phones will either lose customers or be forced to support it. That's the way the free market works. dhamp2g bc I bought a daydream when it was on sale bc I though 4sure that the s8 would support it. I will get the next pixel when it comes out and ditch my s8 and use my s7 for gearVR. I wanted one phone for both. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck with that! I don't care about VR, but if I did, I'd get the phone that supports VR with the most content. That's what determines the end game. Suicide_Note VR is crap, and anything that speeds its demise is fine by me. https://media0.giphy.com/media/d4aTnvQuF6xyfgWI/giphy.gif kgptzac Anyone with a brain should not find this surprising, and should be easily see the reasons behind it. Once again the burden falls to developers to either make exclusives, or games that support multiple VR platforms. It's not unfair either... developers have always been choosing between sony and microsoft on consoles, and google and apple on mobile, so it's fair game. likurges daydream is a gimmick. useless crap in it's current form. On the other hand samsung is an ass for not supporting it Averix No great loss. VR is a fad for right now. The lack of content makes that obvious. Since they're giving away a headset for the Samsung Oculus experience, I don't think Daydream matters much here. Jesse Lee "Could" be Samsung's deal with Oculus?! Absolutely it has to do with the competing VR platform offered by Oculus. I guess I never would have thought they were going to and never got hopes up for it just the same as I never thought the Pixel was going to include Oculus software, kind of a no-brainer really. Jordan L It's possible the Samsung could support both VR's, and maybe Oculus is elusive to Samsung? So pixel couldn't support both platforms. If that's true, then one could hope Samsung would support both.(it was a long shot). Daydream is open to all manufactures... Is Oculus?

A beginner's guide to IFTTT on Android 12 powerful websites that can replace your PC's desktop software Video Intel's object recognition software tells you what's what One of the biggest boons to productivity has been the proliferation of automation tools like IFTTT. These apps and services dramatically cut down on the time and energy you spend performing common or repetitive tasks. It you’re looking to bring more efficiency to your personal or work life, consider having one of these tools do the heavy lifting. Zapier Along with IFTTT, Zapier is one of heavy hitters of task automation, but with a couple of key differences. First, unlike IFTTT, which only enables two-step actions, Zapier supports multiple-step processes, called “Zaps.” Second, it integrates with popular business-oriented apps as well as personal ones. PCWorld Zapier’s editor lets you create your own Zaps from scratch. Zapier offers dozens of prebuilt Zaps for popular productivity apps including Google Sheets, Trello, and Gmail. But you’ll get the most out of it by creating your own workflows using the Zap editor to define triggers and actions between the apps you choose. Zapier currently integrates with more than 750 apps, including Slack, Asana, Quickbooks, and virtually all of Google’s productivity suite. [ Further reading: Your new PC needs these 15 free, excellent programs ] You can use Zapier for free to make two-step Zaps with a limited selection of apps. You’ll need a subscription, starting at $20 a month with a free two-week trial, to unlock its full power. Integromat Another IFTTT-like task automator, Integromat enables multi-step workflows dubbed “integrations.” As with Zapier, Integromat works with an array of personal and business apps. PCWorld Integromat offers a huge library of customizable integrations for personal and work scenarios. Integromat offers hundreds of predesigned integrations for use cases from time and task management to software development and sales. They range from the simple tasks (“Back up phone numbers from Google Contacts to Evernote”) to complex scenarios (“Update selected Google Sheets rows with Google Analytics visits to specific websites”). Any of these integrations can be customized to suit your specific needs. You can perform up to 1,000 Integromat operations (each time you run a trigger is considered on operation) for free. Beyond that, you’ll need one of its subscription plans, which range from $9 to $299 a month. Workflow Workflow Workflow’s drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to create custom processes. You don’t work only on your PC, so you shouldn’t restrict your automation efforts to your computer either. Workflow is an iOS app that allows you to create all kinds of automation actions for your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch. True to its name, this personal productivity app lets you create “workflows”—combinations of multiple steps—to complete a desired action with just one tap. For example, the Note to Self workflow links five steps to easily create a voice memo, save it to Dropbox, and add the Dropbox link to Reminders. There are several of these pre-fab workflows that simplify everything from sending a text to let someone know you’re running late to requesting an Uber to a specific destination. You can also build your own by dragging-and-dropping apps and actions. Workflow is $3 in the App Store.
